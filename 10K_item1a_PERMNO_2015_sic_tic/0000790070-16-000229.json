{"cik": "790070", "company": "EMC CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risk factors that appear below could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies.\nThe announcement and pendency of the Dell transaction may materially adversely affect our business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the proposed merger on our employees, customers and other parties may have a material adverse effect on our business. Our employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the merger. There can be no assurance that our employees, including key personnel, can be retained to the same extent that we have previously been able to attract and retain employees. Any loss of such employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial position.\nParties with which we do business may experience uncertainty associated with the merger and related transactions, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us. Such uncertainty could cause customers, suppliers and others to seek to change existing business relationships or delay or defer certain business decisions with us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial position.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business, including the ability in certain cases to enter into contracts, acquire or dispose of assets, incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures, until the proposed merger closes or the Merger Agreement terminates. The restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise\nattractive business opportunities and taking other actions with respect to our business that we may consider advantageous and result in our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures and industry developments, and may otherwise harm our business and operations.\nIn addition, we have diverted, and will continue to divert, significant management resources towards the completion of the transaction, which could materially adversely affect our business and operations.\nFailure to consummate the Dell transaction could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results.\nThere can be no assurance that the proposed merger with Denali will occur. If the merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of a failure of our shareholders to approve the Merger Agreement, the ongoing business of EMC may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the price of our common stock, and litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement. A failed transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community. Further, any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the merger, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, partners and employees, could continue or accelerate in the event of a failed transaction.\nConsummation of the merger is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, (i) approval by our shareholders; (ii) the absence of an order or law prohibiting consummation of the merger; (iii) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act and the receipt of consents under other specified antitrust laws; (iv) the absence of a material adverse effect on us; (v) the accuracy of the parties\u2019 respective representations and warranties; and (vi) the parties\u2019 respective compliance with agreements and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement. Many of the conditions to closing of the merger are not within our control and there can be no assurance that these and other conditions to closing will be satisfied. In addition, the closing may not occur if the required financing for the transaction is unavailable or delayed.\nThe Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights for both us and Denali, and in certain specified circumstances upon termination of the Merger Agreement, including a termination by us to enter into an agreement for a superior proposal, we will be required to pay Denali a cash termination fee. This payment could affect the structure, pricing and terms proposed by a third party seeking to acquire or merge with us and could deter such third party from making a competing acquisition proposal.\nThe Merger Agreement provides for limited remedies for us in the event of a breach by Denali or its affiliates that results in termination of the Merger Agreement, including the right to a reverse termination fee payable under certain specified circumstances. There can be no assurance that a remedy will be available to us in the event of such a breach or that any damages incurred by us in connection with the merger will not exceed the amount of the reverse termination fee.\nIn addition, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed merger. We will be required to pay such costs relating to the transaction whether or not the merger is completed.\nLawsuits have been filed, and other lawsuits may be filed, challenging the merger. An adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may delay the merger or prevent the merger from being completed.\nLawsuits have been filed against various combinations of EMC, its current and former directors, VMware, certain of VMware\u2019s directors, Denali and Dell, among other defendants. Certain of the lawsuits have generally alleged, among other things, that the directors of EMC breached their fiduciary duties to EMC shareholders in connection with the merger; that various combinations of defendants aided and abetted the EMC directors in the alleged breach of their fiduciary duties; that the proxy statement filed by EMC with the SEC in connection with the merger contains material misstatements and omissions; that EMC, in its capacity as the majority shareholder of VMware, and individual defendants who are directors of EMC, VMware or both, breached their fiduciary duties to minority shareholders of VMware in connection with the merger; and that certain defendants aided and abetted those alleged breaches of fiduciary duties. The lawsuits have sought, among other things, injunctive relief enjoining the merger, rescission of the merger if consummated, an award of fees and costs and/or an award of damages. Additional lawsuits arising out of or relating to the Merger Agreement or the merger may be filed in the future. Lawsuits challenging the merger could prevent the merger from being completed, or could result in a material delay in, or the abandonment of, the merger.\nWe may be unable to keep pace with rapid industry, technological and market changes.\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, evolving industry standards and changing needs of customers. In addition, our industry is experiencing one of the most disruptive periods of transition in its history as we move from IT solutions built for the client-server second platform into the next phase of IT growth and innovation, or the third platform. There can be no assurance that our existing products will be properly positioned in the third platform or that we will be able to introduce new or enhanced products into the market on a timely basis, or at all. We spend a considerable amount of money on research and development and introduce new products from time to time. There can be no assurance that enhancements to existing products and solutions or new products and solutions will receive customer acceptance. As competition in the IT industry increases, it may become increasingly difficult for us to maintain a technological advantage and to leverage that advantage toward increased revenues and profits. In addition, there can be no assurance that our vision of enabling hybrid cloud computing, Big Data and trust through infrastructure and application transformation will be accepted or validated in the marketplace.\nRisks associated with the development and introduction of new products include delays in development and changes in data storage, networking virtualization, infrastructure management, information security and operating system technologies which could require us to modify existing products. Risks inherent in the transition to new products include:\n\u2022\nthe difficulty in forecasting customer preferences or demand accurately;\n\u2022\nthe inability to expand production capacity to meet demand for new products;\n\u2022\nthe inability to successfully manage the interoperability and transition from older products;\n\u2022\nthe impact of customers\u2019 demand for new products on the products being replaced, thereby causing a decline in sales of existing products and an excessive, obsolete supply of inventory;\n\u2022\ndelays in initial shipments of new products; and\n\u2022\ndelays in sales caused by the desire of customers to evaluate new products for extended periods of time.\nFurther risks inherent in new product introductions include the uncertainty of price-performance relative to products of competitors and competitors\u2019 responses to such new product introductions. Our failure to introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis, keep pace with rapid industry, technological or market changes or effectively manage the transition to new products or new technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe markets we serve are highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete effectively.\nWe compete with many companies in the markets we serve. Some of our competitors offer a broad spectrum of IT products and services, and others offer specific information storage, protection, security, management, virtualization and intelligence products or services. Some of our competitors (whether independently or by establishing alliances) may have substantially greater financial, marketing or technological resources, larger distribution capabilities, earlier access to customers or greater opportunity to address customers\u2019 various IT requirements than us. In addition, through further consolidation in the IT industry, companies may improve their competitive position and ability to compete against us. We compete on the basis of our products\u2019 features, performance and price as well as our services. Our failure to compete on any of these bases could affect demand for our products or services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nCompanies may develop new technologies or products in advance of us or establish business models or technologies disruptive to us. Our business may be materially adversely affected by the announcement or introduction of new products, including hardware and software products, and new services offered by our competitors, and the implementation of effective marketing or sales strategies by our competitors. The material adverse effect to our business could include a decrease in demand for our products and services and an increase in the length of our sales cycle due to customers taking longer to compare products and services and to complete their purchases.\nWe may have difficulty managing operations.\nOur future operating results will depend on our overall ability to manage operations, which includes, among other things:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully communicating and executing on our unique federation strategy;\n\u2022\nretaining and hiring the appropriate number of qualified employees;\n\u2022\nmanaging, protecting and enhancing, as appropriate, our infrastructure, including but not limited to, our information systems (and our ability to protect confidential information residing on such systems) and internal controls;\n\u2022\naccurately forecasting revenues;\n\u2022\ntraining our sales force to sell effectively, given the breadth of our offerings;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully integrating new acquisitions;\n\u2022\nmanaging inventory levels, including minimizing excess and obsolete inventory, while maintaining sufficient inventory to meet customer demands;\n\u2022\ncontrolling expenses;\n\u2022\nmanaging our manufacturing capacity, real estate facilities and other assets;\n\u2022\nmeeting our sustainability goals; and\n\u2022\nexecuting on our plans.\nAn unexpected decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely reduction in expenses or a failure to manage other aspects of our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected as a result of a lessening demand in the information technology market.\nOur revenue and profitability depend on the overall demand for our products and services. Delays or reductions in IT spending could materially adversely affect demand for our products and services which could result in decreased revenues or earnings.\nOur customers operate in a variety of sectors and across many geographies. Any adverse effects to such markets could materially adversely affect demand for our products and services which could result in decreased revenues or earnings.\nPricing pressures, increases in component and product design costs, decreases in sales volume, or changes to the relative mixture of our revenues could materially adversely affect our revenues, gross margins or earnings.\nOur gross margins are impacted by a variety of factors, including competitive pricing, component and product design costs, sales volume and the relative mixture of product and services revenue. Increased component costs, increased pricing pressures, the relative and varying rates of increases or decreases in component costs and product price, changes in our product and services revenue mixture, including the mixture of subscription based product revenue, or decreased sales volume could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, gross margins or earnings.\nThe costs of third-party components comprise a significant portion of our product costs. We may have difficulty managing our component and product design costs if supplies of certain components become limited or component prices increase. Any such limitation could result in an increase in our component costs. An increase in component or design costs relative to our product prices could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins and earnings. Moreover, certain competitors may have advantages with respect to component costs due to vertical integration of their supply chain, which may include disk drives, microprocessors, memory components and servers.\nThe markets in which we do business are highly competitive, and we may encounter aggressive price competition for all of our products and services from numerous companies globally. There also has been, and may continue to be, a willingness on the part of certain competitors to reduce prices or provide information infrastructure and virtual infrastructure products or services, together with other IT products or services, at minimal or no additional cost in order to preserve or gain market share. Such price competition may result in pressure on our product and service prices, and reductions in product and service prices may have a material adverse effect on our revenues, gross margins or earnings.\nOur financial performance is impacted by the financial performance of VMware.\nBecause we consolidate VMware\u2019s financial results in our results of operations, our financial performance is impacted by the financial performance of VMware. VMware\u2019s financial performance may be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand, adoption rates, sales cycles (which have been increasing in length) and pricing levels for VMware\u2019s products and services;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers\u2019 budgets for information technology purchases and in the timing of its purchasing decisions;\n\u2022\nthe timing of recognizing revenues in any given quarter, which can be affected by a number of factors, including product announcements, beta programs and product promotions that can cause revenue recognition of certain orders to be deferred until future products to which customers are entitled become available;\n\u2022\nthe timing of announcements or releases of new or upgraded products and services by VMware or by its competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing and size of business realignment plans and restructuring charges;\n\u2022\nVMware\u2019s ability to maintain scalable internal systems for reporting, order processing, license fulfillment, product delivery, purchasing, billing and general accounting, among other functions;\n\u2022\nVMware\u2019s ability to control costs, including its operating expenses;\n\u2022\ncredit risks of VMware\u2019s distributors, who account for a significant portion of product revenues and accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nVMware\u2019s ability to process sales at the end of the quarter;\n\u2022\nseasonal factors such as the end of fiscal period budget expenditures by VMware\u2019s customers and the timing of holiday and vacation periods;\n\u2022\nrenewal rates and the amounts of the renewals for enterprise agreements, or EA\u2019s, as original EA terms expire;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of software development costs that may be capitalized;\n\u2022\nunplanned events that could affect market perception of the quality or cost-effectiveness of VMware\u2019s products and solutions; and\n\u2022\nVMware\u2019s ability to accurately predict the degree to which customers will elect to purchase its subscription-based offerings in place of licenses to its on-premises offerings.\nWe may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings in connection with our proposed merger. From time to time, we may also become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including patent, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Furthermore, because litigation is inherently unpredictable, there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nCybersecurity breaches could expose us to liability, damage our reputation, compromise our ability to conduct business, require us to incur significant costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial results.\nWe retain sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information, in our secure data centers and on our networks. We face a number of threats to our data centers and networks of unauthorized access, including security breaches and other system disruptions. It is critical to our business strategy that our infrastructure remains secure and is perceived by our customers and business partners to be secure. Despite our security measures, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or other disruptive problems, such as the sophisticated cyber attack on our RSA division that we disclosed in March 2011. Any such security breach may compromise information stored on our networks and may result in significant data losses or theft of our, our customers\u2019, our business partners\u2019 or our employees\u2019 intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information. In addition, we have outsourced a number of our business functions to third party contractors, and any breach of their security systems could adversely affect us.\nA cybersecurity breach could negatively affect our reputation as a trusted provider of information infrastructure by adversely affecting the market\u2019s perception of the security or reliability of our products or services. In addition, a cyber attack could result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, disruption of internal operations, increased cybersecurity protection costs, lost revenues or litigation.\nOur quarterly revenues or earnings could be materially adversely affected by uneven sales patterns or changing purchasing behaviors.\nOur quarterly sales have historically reflected an uneven pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of a quarter\u2019s total sales occur in the last month and weeks and days of each quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes it difficult for us to accurately predict revenues, earnings and working capital for each financial period and increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition. We believe this uneven sales pattern is a result of many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe relative dollar amount of our product and services offerings in relation to many of our customers\u2019 budgets, resulting in long lead times for customers\u2019 budgetary approval, which tends to be given late in a quarter;\n\u2022\nthe tendency of customers to wait until late in a quarter to commit to purchase in the hope of obtaining more favorable pricing from one or more competitors seeking their business;\n\u2022\nthe fourth-quarter influence of customers spending their remaining capital budget authorization prior to new budget constraints in the first nine months of the following year; and\n\u2022\nseasonal influences.\nOur uneven sales pattern makes it extremely difficult to predict near-term demand and adjust manufacturing capacity or our supply chain accordingly. Our backlog at any particular time is also not necessarily indicative of future sales levels. This is because:\n\u2022\nwe assemble our products on the basis of our forecast of near-term demand and maintain inventory in advance of receipt of firm orders from customers;\n\u2022\nwe generally ship products shortly after receipt of the order; and\n\u2022\ncustomers may generally reschedule or cancel orders with little or no penalty.\nIf predicted demand is substantially greater than orders, we will have excess inventory. Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, our ability to assemble, test and ship orders received in the last weeks and days of each quarter may be limited. This could materially adversely affect quarterly revenues or earnings as our revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter.\nLoss of infrastructure, due to factors such as an information systems failure, loss of public utilities, natural disasters or extreme weather conditions, could also impact our ability to book orders or ship products in a timely manner. Delays in product shipping or an unexpected decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely slowdown in expenses, could intensify the impact of these factors on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, unanticipated changes in our customers\u2019 purchasing behaviors, such as customers taking longer to negotiate and complete their purchases or making smaller, incremental purchases based on their current needs, can also make it difficult for us to accurately predict revenues, earnings and working capital for each financial period and increase the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected as a result of general global economic and market conditions.\nWe are subject to the effects of general global economic and market conditions that are beyond our control. If these conditions remain challenging or worsen, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Possible consequences of macroeconomic global challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition include insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays, inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products, customer insolvencies, increased risk that customers may delay payments, fail to pay or default on credit extended to them, and counterparty failures that negatively impact our treasury operations.\nOur business may suffer if we are unable to retain or attract key personnel.\nOur business depends to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key employees, the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining and developing existing personnel or recruiting new personnel. The loss of one or more key employees, our inability to attract or develop additional qualified employees or any delay in hiring key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nUndetected problems in our products could directly impair our financial results.\nIf flaws in design, production, assembly or testing of our products (by us or our suppliers) were to occur, we could experience a rate of failure in our products that would result in substantial delays in shipment, significant repair, replacement or service costs or potential damage to our reputation. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Continued improvement in manufacturing capabilities, control of material and manufacturing quality and costs and product testing are critical factors in our future growth. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts to monitor, develop, modify and implement appropriate testing and manufacturing processes for our products will be sufficient to avoid a rate of failure in our products that could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur stock price is volatile and may be affected by factors related to VMware.\nOur stock price, like that of other technology companies, is subject to significant volatility because of factors such as:\n\u2022\nthe announcement of acquisitions, new products, services or technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community; and\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be affected by various factors related to VMware, including:\n\u2022\nthe trading price for VMware Class A common stock;\n\u2022\nactions taken or statements made by us, VMware, or others concerning our relationship with VMware; and\n\u2022\nfactors impacting the performance of VMware, including those discussed in the risk factor above regarding the impact of VMware\u2019s financial performance on our financial performance.\nIn addition, although we own a majority of VMware and consolidate its financial results in our results of operations, our stock price may not accurately reflect our pro rata ownership interest of VMware.\nDue to the global nature of our business, political, economic or regulatory changes or other factors in a specific country or region could impair our international operations, future revenue or financial condition.\nA substantial portion of our revenues is derived from sales outside the United States including, increasingly, in rapid growth markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and China. In addition, a substantial portion of our products is manufactured outside of the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors relating to our operations outside the United States, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s economic conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical or social unrest;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions;\n\u2022\nimport or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nthe overlap of different tax structures or changes in international tax laws;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\nstringent privacy policies in some foreign countries;\n\u2022\ncompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles in certain countries.\nOur foreign operations, particularly in those countries with developing economies, are also subject to laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Our employees, contractors and agents may take actions in violation of our policies that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws. Any such violations could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nIn addition, we hold a significant portion of our cash and investments in our international subsidiaries. Potential regulations could impact our ability to transfer this cash and these investments to the United States. Although the international cash is permanently reinvested, should we be required to repatriate cash, we may incur a significant tax obligation.\nWe operate a Venezuelan sales subsidiary with a U.S. dollar functional currency. As a result, Bolivar-denominated transactions are subject to exchange gains and losses that may impact our earnings. As of quarter end, three exchange rates are available, via legal mechanisms administered by the Venezuelan government, to convert Bolivars into U.S. dollars. These three mechanisms are CENCOEX (official exchange rate), SICAD I and Simadi (formerly known as SICAD II). We have continued to use CENCOEX to remeasure these balances based upon the expected rate at which we believe is most appropriate for these items to be settled. We are closely monitoring information concerning these rates in the event it becomes appropriate to adopt a rate other than CENCOEX. Changing the rate used to re-measure our Bolivar-denominated transactions to either the SICAD I or Simadi rates could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf our suppliers are not able to meet our requirements, we could have decreased revenues and earnings.\nWe purchase or license many sophisticated components and products from one or a limited number of qualified suppliers, including some of our competitors. These components and products include flash drives, disk drives, high density memory components, power supplies and software developed and maintained by third parties. We have experienced delivery delays from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery\nrequirements. Natural disasters have also in the past impacted, and may continue to impact, our ability to procure certain components in a timely fashion, and an economic crisis could also negatively affect the solvency of our suppliers, resulting in product delays. Current or future social and environmental regulations or issues, such as those relating to the sourcing of conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or the elimination of environmentally sensitive materials from our products, could restrict the supply of resources used in production or increase our costs. If any of our suppliers were to cancel or materially change contracts or commitments with us or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose time-sensitive customer orders, be unable to develop or sell certain products cost-effectively or on a timely basis, if at all, and have significantly decreased quarterly revenues and earnings, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, we periodically transition our product line to incorporate new technologies. The importance of transitioning our customers smoothly to such new technologies, along with our historically uneven pattern of quarterly sales (as discussed in a prior risk factor), intensifies the risk that the failure of a supplier to meet our quality or delivery requirements will have a material adverse impact on our revenues and earnings.\nOur investment portfolio could experience a decline in market value which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe held $8.2 billion in short- and long-term investments as of December 31, 2015. These investments consist primarily of investment grade debt securities, and we limit the amount of investment with any one issuer. A further deterioration in the economy, including a tightening of credit markets, increased defaults by issuers, or significant volatility in interest rates, could cause these investments to decline in value or could otherwise impact the liquidity of our portfolio. If market conditions deteriorate significantly, our results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks associated with our distribution channels may materially adversely affect our financial results.\nIn addition to our direct sales force, we have agreements in place with many distributors, systems integrators, resellers and original equipment manufacturers to market and sell our products and services. We derive a significant percentage of our revenues from such distribution channels. Our financial results could be materially adversely affected if our contracts with channel partners were terminated, if our relationship with channel partners were to deteriorate, if the financial condition of our channel partners were to weaken, if our channel partners were not able to timely and effectively implement their planned actions or if the level of demand for our channel partners\u2019 products and services were to decrease. In addition, as our market opportunities change, we may have an increased reliance on channel partners, which may negatively impact our gross margins. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining or expanding these channels. If we are not successful in maintaining or expanding these channels, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and market share. Furthermore, our partial reliance on channel partners may materially reduce our management\u2019s visibility of potential customers and demand for products and services, thereby making it more difficult to accurately forecast such demand. In addition, there can be no assurance that our channel partners will not develop, market or sell products or services or acquire other companies that develop, market or sell products or services in competition with us in the future.\nIn addition, as we focus on new market opportunities and additional customers through our various distribution channels, including small-to-medium sized businesses, we may be required to provide different levels of service and support than we typically have provided in the past. We may have difficulty managing directly or indirectly through our channels these different service and support requirements and may be required to incur substantial costs to provide such services, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with alliances.\nWe have strategic alliances with leading information technology companies, some of whom may be our competitors in other areas, and we plan to continue our strategy of developing key alliances in order to expand our reach into existing and new markets. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our ongoing strategic alliances or that we will be able to find further suitable business relationships as we develop new products and strategies. Any failure to continue or expand such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThere can be no assurance that companies with which we have strategic alliances, certain of which have substantially greater financial, marketing or technological resources than us, will not develop or market products in competition with us in the future, discontinue their alliances with us or form alliances with our competitors.\nOur business may suffer if we cannot protect our intellectual property.\nWe generally rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and contract rights in the United States and in other countries to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products. However, there can be no assurance that any of our proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to any technology that we may require to conduct our business or that, if obtainable, such technology can be licensed at a reasonable cost.\nFrom time to time, we receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of third-party patent or other intellectual property rights. Responding to any such claim, regardless of its merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products or a successful claim of infringement against us requiring us to pay royalties to a third party, and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, although we believe we have adequate security measures, if our intellectual property or other sensitive data is misappropriated, we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIssues arising during the upgrade of our enterprise resource planning system could affect our operating results and ability to manage our business effectively.\nWe are in the process of upgrading our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, computer system to enhance operating efficiencies and provide more effective management of our business operations. While one phase of our upgrade was implemented in the third quarter of 2012, we still have further planned phases to our upgrade. The upgrade could cause substantial business interruption that could adversely impact our operating results. We are investing significant financial and personnel resources into this project. However, there is no assurance that the system upgrade will meet our current or future business needs or that it will operate as designed. We are heavily dependent on such computer systems, and any significant failure or delay in the system upgrade could cause a substantial interruption to our business and additional expense, which could result in an adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows or financial condition.\nWe may have exposure to additional income tax liabilities.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, which might significantly impact our effective income tax rate in the future. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenues and expenses in different jurisdictions and the timing of recognizing revenues and expenses. Additionally, the amount of income taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws and rules in the jurisdictions in which we file and changes to tax laws and rules. From time to time, we are subject to income tax audits. While we believe we have complied with all applicable income tax laws, there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes. Should we be assessed with additional taxes, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nAs part of the current Administration\u2019s ongoing negotiations, President Obama and House of Representatives and Senate Committees have called for a comprehensive tax reform, which might change certain U.S. tax rules for U.S. corporations doing business outside the United States. While the scope of future changes differs among various tax proposals and remains unclear, proposed changes might include limiting the ability of U.S. corporations to deduct certain expenses attributable to offshore earnings, modifying the foreign tax credit rules and taxing currently certain transfers of intangibles offshore. The enactment of some or all of these proposals could increase the Company\u2019s effective tax rate and adversely affect our profitability.\nRecent developments in 2014, including the Irish government\u2019s announced changes to the taxation of certain existing non-resident Irish companies beginning in January 2021, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, could ultimately impact our tax liabilities to foreign jurisdictions and treatment of our foreign earnings from a U.S. perspective, which may adversely impact our effective tax rate.\nOn December 28, 2015, the U.S. Tax Court issued a final decision in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner related to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. At this time, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement from its regulations to include stock-based compensation. The I.R.S. has the right to appeal the U.S. Tax Court decision. We concluded that no adjustment to our consolidated financial statements is appropriate at this time due to the uncertainties with respect to the ultimate resolution of this case.\nChanges in laws or regulations could materially adversely affect us.\nOur business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected if laws, regulations or standards relating to us or our products are newly implemented or changed. In addition, our compliance with existing regulations may have a material adverse impact on us. Under applicable federal securities laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. Should we or our independent auditors determine that we have material weaknesses in our internal controls, our results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected or our stock price may decline.\nChanges in generally accepted accounting principles may materially adversely affect us.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) promulgates new accounting principles that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. The FASB is currently contemplating a number of new accounting pronouncements which, if approved, could materially change our reported results. Such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions, investments and joint ventures.\nAs part of our business strategy, we seek to acquire businesses that offer complementary products, services or technologies. These acquisitions are accompanied by risks commonly encountered in an acquisition of a business, which may include, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe effect of the acquisition on our financial and strategic position and reputation;\n\u2022\nthe failure of an acquired business to further our strategic plans;\n\u2022\nthe failure of the acquisition to result in expected benefits, which may include benefits relating to enhanced revenues, technology, human resources, cost savings, operating efficiencies and other synergies;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty and cost of integrating the acquired business, including costs and delays in implementing common systems and procedures and costs and delays caused by communication difficulties or geographic distances between the two companies\u2019 sites;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of known or unknown liabilities of the acquired business, including litigation-related liability;\n\u2022\nthe potential impairment of acquired assets;\n\u2022\nthe lack of experience in new markets, products or technologies or the initial dependence on unfamiliar supply or distribution partners;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of relationships with customers or suppliers of the acquired business or our customers or suppliers;\n\u2022\nthe recoverability of benefits from goodwill and intangible assets and the potential impairment of these assets;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; and\n\u2022\nthe potential incompatibility of business cultures.\nThese factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. To the extent that we issue shares of our common stock or other rights to purchase our common stock in connection with any future acquisition, existing shareholders may experience dilution. Additionally, regardless of the form of consideration issued, acquisitions could negatively impact our net income and our earnings per share.\nIn addition to the risks commonly encountered in the acquisition of a business as described above, we may also experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a transaction or failing to close an announced transaction. Further, the risks described above may be exacerbated as a result of managing multiple acquisitions at the same time.\nWe also seek to invest in businesses that offer complementary products, services or technologies and to, from time to time, create new joint ventures or alliances. These investments and ventures are accompanied by risks similar to those encountered in an acquisition of a business.\nOur pension plan assets are subject to market volatility.\nWe have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan assumed as part of our Data General acquisition. The plan\u2019s assets are invested in common stocks, bonds and cash. The expected long-term rate of return on the plan\u2019s assets was 6.50%. This rate represents the average of the expected long-term rates of return weighted by the plan\u2019s assets as of December 31, 2015. As market conditions permit, we expect to continue to shift the asset allocation to lower the percentage of investments in equities and increase the percentage of investments in long-duration fixed-income securities. The effect of such change could result in a reduction in the long-term rate of return on plan assets and an increase in future pension expense. As of December 31, 2015, the ten-year historical rate of return on plan assets was 6.45%, and the inception to date return on plan assets was 6.46%. In 2015, we experienced a 2.42% loss on plan assets. Should we not achieve the expected rate of return on the plan\u2019s assets or if the plan experiences a decline in the fair value of its assets, we may be required to contribute assets to the plan which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by changes in regulations or standards regarding energy use of our products.\nWe continually seek ways to increase the energy efficiency of our products. Recent environmental analyses have focused on the estimated amount of global carbon emissions that are generated by information technology products. As a result, governmental and non-governmental organizations have turned their attention to the development of regulations and standards to drive technological improvements to reduce the amount of such carbon emissions. There is a risk that any regulations or standards developed by these organizations will not fully address the complexity of the products and technology developed by the IT industry or will favor certain technological approaches to reducing such carbon emissions. Depending on the regulations or standards that are ultimately adopted, compliance with such regulations or standards could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected as a result of war, acts of terrorism, natural disasters or climate change.\nTerrorist acts, acts of war, natural disasters, or the direct and indirect effects of climate change (such as a rise in sea level, increased storm severity, drought, flooding, wildfires, pandemics, and social unrest from resource depletion and rising food prices) may cause damage or disruption to our employees, facilities, customers, partners, suppliers, distributors and resellers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Such events may also cause damage or disruption to transportation and communication systems and to our ability to manage logistics in such an environment, including receipt of components and distribution of products.\nOur failure to pay quarterly dividends to our shareholders could materially adversely affect our stock price.\nOur ability to pay quarterly dividends will be subject to, among other things, our financial position and results of operations, available cash and cash flow, and capital requirements. Any reduction or discontinuation of quarterly dividends could cause our stock price to decline significantly.", "PERMNO": 10147, "SIC": 3572, "TIC": "EMC"}
