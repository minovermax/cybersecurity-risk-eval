{"cik": "879585", "company": "ATLANTIC TELE NETWORK INC /DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Report, you should carefully consider the risks described below that could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. These risks are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nWe are actively evaluating investment, acquisition and other strategic opportunities, which may affect our long-term growth prospects.\nWe are actively evaluating acquisition, investment and other strategic opportunities, both domestic and international, in telecommunications, energy-related and other industries, including in areas that may not be seen by the broader market as timely today. We may focus on opportunities that we believe have potential for long-term organic and strategic growth or that may otherwise satisfy our return and other investment criteria. Any acquisition or investment that we might make outside of the telecommunications industry would pose the risk inherent in us entering into a new, unrelated business, including the ability of our holding company management team to effectively oversee the management team of such operations. There can be no assurance as to whether, when or on what terms we will be able to invest in, acquire or divest any businesses or assets or that we will be able to successfully integrate the business or realize the perceived benefits of any acquisition. Any such transactions may be accomplished through the payment of cash, issuance of shares of our capital stock or incurrence of additional debt, or a combination thereof. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $398.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash primarily as a result of the proceeds from the 2013 sale of our U.S. retail wireless business operated under the Alltel name to AT&T Mobility LLC, and only approximately $32.9 million of long-term debt. How and when we deploy our balance sheet capacity will figure prominently in our longer-term growth prospects and stockholder returns.\nThe pending acquisitions in our telecommunications businesses are subject to the consent of regulatory authorities and other third parties, and the failure to receive any such consents or the imposition by any such regulatory authority or third party of any conditions to such acquisitions may adversely affect our business.\nOn September 30, 2015, we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the membership interests of Caribbean Asset Holdings LLC, the holding company for the Innovative group of companies operating cable TV, Internet and landline services primarily in the U.S. Virgin Islands from the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation. The agreement is subject to customary closing terms and conditions and the receipt of approvals from the Federal Communications Commission (the \u201cFCC\u201d) and regulatory authorities in the U.S. and British Virgin Islands and St. Maarten. Although we have received no indication that these regulatory authorities do not plan to grant the required approvals, there can be no guarantee that we will receive such approvals. In addition, the FCC may impose conditions on any approval, such as requiring the divestiture of certain markets and spectrum licenses. These conditions, if imposed and if sufficiently significant, may permit CFC not to consummate the transaction or may have other negative impacts on our business.\nOn October 5, 2015, we entered into an agreement with KeyTech Limited, a publicly held Bermuda company listed on the Bermuda Stock Exchange that provides broadband and cable television services and other telecommunications services to residential and enterprise customers under the \u201cLogic\u201d name in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, in which we will acquire a controlling interest in KeyTech as part of a proposed business combination of KeyTech with our subsidiary providing wireless services under the \u201cCellOne\u201d name in Bermuda. The proposed transaction is subject to customary closing terms and conditions, including, among others, the receipt of approval from the Bermuda Regulatory Authority, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Information and Communications Technology Authority of the Cayman Islands and the consent of the Bermuda Stock Exchange to certain transaction matters. KeyTech shareholders approved the proposed transaction by affirmative vote on October 20, 2015. Although we have received no indication that the regulatory authorities listed above do not plan to grant the required approvals, there can be no guarantee that we will receive such approval or consent, or that it will be on a timely basis. In addition, the Bermuda Regulatory Authority may impose conditions on any approval, such as a prohibition or\nstrict approval of any bundling of services between the combined companies. If these conditions are imposed and are sufficiently significant, or if the regulatory authorities do not approve the transaction on a timely basis, KeyTech may be permitted to not to consummate the transaction or there may be other negative impacts on our business or the business of the combined companies following the consummation of the KeyTech Transaction.\nRisks Related to our Wireless Businesses\nA significant portion of our U.S. wholesale wireless revenue is derived from a small number of customers.\nA substantial portion of our U.S. Wireless revenue is generated from four national wireless service providers. Our U.S. Wireless revenues accounted for approximately 44% of our consolidated revenues in 2015. Excluding our corporate overhead, our U.S. Wireless business accounted for approximately 72% of our consolidated operating income in 2015.\nOur relationships with our roaming customers generally are much more financially significant for us than for our customers. Typically, our relationships with our roaming customers do not require them to \u201cprefer\u201d our networks or require them to send us a minimum amount of traffic. Instead, roaming customers may choose to utilize other networks, if available, for their subscribers\u2019 roaming use. If our markets currently included in our roaming partners\u2019 home calling areas are instead subject to the imposition of additional roaming charges or if we fail to keep any of our roaming customers satisfied with our service offerings or economic terms, we could lose their business, experience less roaming traffic or be unable to renew or enter into new agreements with these customers on beneficial terms (including pricing), resulting in a substantial loss of revenue, which would have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if these customers build or acquire wireless networks in our service areas we may lose revenue. Should any of these customers take such actions over a significant portion of the areas we serve, it may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may have difficulty meeting the growing demand for data services.\nDemand for smartphones and data services continues to grow across all of our wireless markets and our value to our customers in some markets depends in part on our network\u2019s ability to provide high-quality and high capacity network service to smartphone devices. Indeed, much of the revenue growth in our U.S. Wireless segment in 2015 was attributable to increased demand for data services. However, if data usage increases faster than we anticipate and exceeds the then-available capacity of any of our networks, our costs to deliver roaming services may be higher than we anticipate or the quality of our service may be negatively affected. In addition, the dearth of available spectrum in our industry means that we cannot guarantee that we will be able to acquire additional spectrum at a reasonable cost or at all to ensure our ability to maintain or grow our business and traffic volumes. As demand for advanced mobile data services continues to grow, we may have difficulty satisfying our wholesale roaming partners\u2019 demand for these services without substantial upgrades and additional capital expenditures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Wireline Services in Guyana\nOur exclusive license to provide local exchange and international voice and data services in Guyana is subject to significant political and regulatory risk.\nSince 1991, our subsidiary Guyana Telephone and Telegraph, Ltd. (\u201cGT&T\u201d) has operated in Guyana pursuant to a license from the Government of Guyana to be the exclusive provider of domestic fixed and international voice and data services pursuant to a license with an initial term ending in December 2010, which was renewable at our sole option for an additional 20 year term. In November 2009, we notified the Government of Guyana of our election to renew our exclusive license for an additional 20 year term expiring in 2030. On December 15, 2010, we received correspondence from the Government of Guyana indicating that our license had been renewed until such time that new legislation is in place with regard to the Government\u2019s intention to expand competition within the sector; however, we believe our exclusive license continues to be valid unless and until such time as we enter into an alternative agreement with the Government.\nSince 2001, the Government of Guyana has stated its intention to introduce additional competition into Guyana\u2019s telecommunications sector. Since that time, we have met on many occasions with officials of the Government of Guyana to discuss potential modifications of our exclusivity and other rights under the existing agreement. In 2012, the Government of Guyana introduced a bill into Parliament containing draft legislation, regulations, and licenses that, if enacted, would have the effect of terminating our exclusive license by permitting other telecommunications carriers to receive licenses to provide domestic fixed services and international voice and data services in Guyana. The proposed legislation would also introduce material changes to many other features of Guyana\u2019s existing telecommunications regulatory regime. We cannot predict when or if the proposed legislation will be adopted by Parliament or, if adopted and then signed into law by the President, the manner in which it would be implemented by the Minister of Telecommunications and the PUC. Although we believe that we would be entitled to damages or other compensation for any involuntary termination of our contractual exclusivity rights, we cannot guarantee that we would prevail in a proceeding to enforce our rights or that such actions would effectively halt any unilateral action by the Government.\nIn addition, since 2009, we have been engaged in lawsuits in Guyana challenging the legality of GT&T\u2019s exclusive license rights under Guyana\u2019s constitution. As recently as 2012, a trial court made findings calling into question the validity of our exclusive license, prompting Digicel, our main competitor in Guyana, to begin openly connecting its own international traffic out of Guyana without receiving an international license and at rates which had not been approved by the Guyana PUC. In response, the Guyana PUC ordered Digicel to cease providing service at such rates, and the government of Guyana notified us that they have undertaken to advise Digicel that its activities are in contravention of Guyana law. The Guyana courts also granted GT&T an interim injunction restraining Digicel from bypassing GT&T\u2019s network. GT&T has also appealed the case, not only with respect to the contract claim, but also as to the court\u2019s findings regarding the exclusivity of GT&T\u2019s license and its application to VoIP services.\nWe are dependent on GT&T for approximately 25% of our total consolidated revenues. A loss of exclusivity on international voice and data service would result in a reduction in the international call traffic and as a result, a loss in that portion of our wireline revenue. Any modification, early termination or other revocation of the exclusive domestic fixed and international voice and data license could adversely affect our revenues and profits and diminish the value of our investment in Guyana.\nOther Risks Relating to Our Telecommunications Businesses\nThe loss of certain licenses could adversely affect our ability to provide wireless and broadband services.\nIn the United States, wireless, PCS and microwave licenses are valid for ten years from the effective date of the license. Licensees may renew their licenses for additional ten-year periods by filing renewal applications with the FCC. Our wireless licenses in the U.S. expire between 2015 and 2019. While we intend to renew our licenses expiring this year, the renewal applications are subject to FCC review and are put out for public comment to ensure that the licensees meet their licensing requirements and comply with other applicable FCC mandates. Failure to file for renewal of these licenses or failure to meet any licensing requirements could lead to a denial of the renewal application and thus adversely affect our ability to continue to provide service in that license area. Furthermore, our compliance with regulatory requirements such as enhanced 911 and CALEA requirements may depend on the availability of necessary equipment or software.\nIn our international markets, telecommunications licenses are typically issued and regulated by the applicable telecommunications ministry. The application and renewal process for these licenses may be lengthy, require us to expend substantial renewal fees, and/or be subject to regulatory uncertainty, such as we are experiencing in Guyana, as described above. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements may have an adverse effect on our licenses or operations and could result in sanctions, fines or other penalties.\nRapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry may adversely affect us.\nOur industry faces rapid and significant changes in technology that directly impact our business, including the following:\n\u00b7\nevolving industry standards;\n\u00b7\nrequirements resulting from changing regulatory regimes;\n\u00b7\nthe allocation of radio frequency spectrum in which to license and operate advanced wireless services;\n\u00b7\nongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology;\n\u00b7\nchanges in end-user requirements and preferences;\n\u00b7\nconvergence between video and data services;\n\u00b7\ndevelopment of data and broadband capabilities and rapidly expanding demand for those capabilities; and\n\u00b7\nmigration to new-generation services such as LTE or \u201c4G\u201d network technology.\nFor us to keep up with these technological changes and remain competitive, at a minimum we will be required to continue to make significant capital expenditures to add to our networks\u2019 capacity, coverage and technical capability. For example, we have spent considerable amounts adding higher speed, higher capacity mobile data services to many of our networks in recent years and we think it likely that more such expenditures, including adding LTE mobile data technologies, will be needed over the next few years.\nWe cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business. Alternative or new technologies may be developed that provide communications services superior to those available from us, which may adversely affect our business. For example, to accommodate the demand by our wireless customers for next-generation advanced wireless products such as high-speed data and streaming video, we may be required to purchase additional spectrum, however, we have had difficulty finding spectrum for sale or on terms that are acceptable to us. In our Bermuda market, the action taken by the Regulatory Authority to recapture spectrum we formerly held will have an impact on our ability to deploy next generation mobile technologies. In addition, usage of wireless voice or broadband services in excess of our expectations could strain our capacity, causing service disruptions and result in higher operating costs and capital expenditures. In each of our markets, providing more and higher speed data services through our wireless or wireline networks may require us to make substantial investments in additional telecommunications transport capacity connecting our networks to the Internet, and in some cases such capacity may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all. Failure to provide these services or to upgrade to new technologies on a timely basis and at an acceptable cost could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete with carriers in our markets.\nRisks Related to Our Renewable Energy Business\nOur Facilities have a limited operating history.\nAll of our Facilities have limited operating histories. Our expectations about the performance of these Facilities are based on assumptions and estimates made without the benefit of operating history. There can be no assurance that our Facilities will perform as anticipated or projected and the failure of these Facilities to perform as we expect could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of our Renewable Energy segment.\nOur revenues are dependent on the performance and effectiveness of our PPAs.\nThe cash flow from the PPAs and PBIs is significantly affected by our ability to collect payments from offtakers under our PPAs. While we believe that all of our current customers are high-quality credit entities, if for any reason these customers are unable or unwilling to fulfill their related contractual obligations or if they refuse to accept delivery of power or otherwise terminate such agreements, this non-payment could have a material adverse effect on our revenues. In addition, our inability to perform our obligations under the PPAs could also have a material adverse effect on our revenues. For instance, our inability to meet certain operating thresholds or performance measures under certain of our PPAs within specified time periods exposes us to the risk of covering the cost of any shortfall or early termination by such customer.\nCertain of our PPAs provide for early termination for a variety of reasons, including in the event that (a) an offtaker is unable to appropriate funds from state and local governments, (b) there is a change of law that substantially reduces the value of utility credits, (c) termination for convenience, or (d) the Facility causes damage to the premises or roof and our customer fails to repair or causes the customer to be in violation of law, or the customer ceases to hold tenancy or fee interest in the premises. While we would be entitled to a termination fee (typically set at the terminal value of the PPA) in most cases, the termination fee might not be a sufficient substitute for the payments otherwise due under the PPAs. There can be no assurances that such appropriations will be made or timely made in any given year or that tax or other incentives continued to be available for the purchase of solar energy. In the event a PPA for one or more of our projects is terminated or payments are not made (or not made in a timely manner) pursuant to such provisions, it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot provide any assurance that PPAs containing such provisions will not be terminated or, in the event of termination, we will be able to enter into a replacement PPA. Moreover, any replacement PPA may be on terms less favorable to us than the PPA that was terminated.\nOur revenue may be exposed to SREC uncertainty inflation-based price increases or other external factors.\nWe also generate solar renewable energy credits, or SRECs, which are government emissions allowances obtained through power generation and compliance with various regulations from the government as our projects produce electricity. Revenue is recognized as SRECs are sold through long-term purchase agreements with a third party at the contractual rate specified in the agreement. In 2015, approximately 64% of our renewable energy revenue was earned from SREC contracts and PBIs and 36% was earned from PPAs. SRECs may also be transferred directly to our lenders in lieu of payments due on loans. The revenue derived from our sale of SRECs is dependent on local governments in Massachusetts and California electing to maintain the programs that grant SRECs for power production in these states.\nIn addition, certain of our PPAs do not contain inflation based price increases, resulting in an average, weighted by MW, escalator on our PPAs of 1.11%. To the extent that we experience high rates of inflation we may experience increased operation costs and decreased revenues. In addition, a portion of the revenues under certain of the PPAs for our solar energy projects are subject to price adjustments triggered by a decrease in the market price of electricity over time. This would also have a negative impact on our ability to attract new customers and increase our portfolio, as we believe that an offtaker\u2019s decision to develop our solar projects is primarily driven by a desire to decrease their traditional energy costs. If we are unable to negotiate more favorable pricing, it could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of our Renewable Energy segment. We also believe the solar industry will continue to experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand (i.e., where production capacity exceeds global demand), and that such periods will put pressure on pricing, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are reliant on a key vendor for operation, maintenance and interconnection of our Facilities.\nPursuant to our O&M Agreements, our O&M vendor is required to operate and maintain our Facilities. While this vendor is obligated to indemnify us to the extent it fails to perform under our O&M Agreements, any such failure could cause a delay or reduction in payments under our PPAs. Additionally, we contract with utilities through an interconnection agreement to export excess energy generated by our Facilities to an offtaker and/or the utility electrical\ngrid. Our O&M vendor is required to perform our obligations under the interconnection agreement. If our O&M vendor fails to so perform and interconnection is lost, our offtakers will not receive any energy or net metering credits from such Facility nor a bill credit for energy that would otherwise have been exported to the utility and we may be required to cover these amounts under our PPAs.\nThe growth of our solar business is dependent on our ability to identify and acquire additional solar projects on favorable terms.\nOur business strategy for our Renewable Energy segment is to grow via acquisition and development of additional energy generation assets, with a current focus on solar distributed generation. In order to do so, we are reliant on management to effectively identify and consummate acquisition or new project opportunities on a timely basis and on favorable terms. The number of acquisition and development opportunities is limited, and we compete with some organizations with greater size, scale and resources. In addition, the design, construction and operation of solar energy projects are highly regulated, require various governmental approvals and permits, including environmental approvals and permits, and may be subject to the imposition of related conditions that vary by jurisdiction. We cannot predict whether all permits required for a given project will be granted or granted on terms that are favorable to our business plans. If we are unable to grow our Renewable Energy segment, we may not be able to succeed with our overall business growth strategy.\nOther Risks Related to Our Businesses\nWe rely on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors for timely supply of handsets, accessories, equipment and services relating to our network or Facility infrastructure. If these suppliers or vendors experience problems or favor our competitors, we could fail to obtain sufficient quantities of the products and services we require to operate our businesses successfully.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers and vendors for equipment and services relating to our handset lineup, network infrastructure, solar equipment and our back-office IT systems infrastructure. If these suppliers experience interruptions or other problems delivering these network components on a timely basis, our subscriber or revenue growth and operating results could suffer significantly.\nWe source wireless devices for our retail wireless businesses from a small number of handset resellers and to a lesser extent, equipment manufacturers and depend on access to compelling devices at reasonable prices on primary and secondary markets for these devices, as well as timely delivery of devices to meet market demands. The inability to provide a competitive device lineup could materially impact our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers. We are also reliant upon a limited number of network equipment manufacturers, including Ericsson, Motorola, Alcatel-Lucent and Nokia and a limited number of solar equipment manufacturers, including Yingli and Inventec for photovoltaic modules and SMA and Satcon for inverters.\nWe are also dependent on the ability of our solar equipment manufacturers to fulfill the warranties on our solar equipment, which typically range from 5 to 25 years in length, in the event of equipment malfunction. If these suppliers cease operations or for some reason default on their warranties, we would have to bear the expense our repairing or replacing any faulty equipment. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we cannot make claims under warranties covering our Facilities. If it becomes necessary to seek alternative suppliers and vendors, we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacement suppliers or vendors on economically attractive terms on a timely basis.\nRegulatory changes may impose restrictions that adversely affect us or cause us to incur significant unplanned costs in modifying our business plans or operations.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state and local regulations and foreign government regulations, all of which are subject to change. As new laws and regulations are issued, we may be required to modify our business plans or operations. We cannot be certain that we can do so in a cost-effective manner. For example, a portion of our revenues in our Renewable Energy segment from PPAs is dependent on the ongoing availability of tax credits for clean energy. In\naddition, the failure to comply with applicable governmental regulations could result in the loss of our licenses or authorizations to operate, inability to perform under our PPAs, the assessment of penalties or fines or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.\nOur operations in the United States are subject to the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (or \u201c1996 Act\u201d). The interpretation and implementation of the provisions of the 1996 Act and the FCC rules implementing the 1996 Act continue to be heavily debated and may have a material adverse effect on our business. Also, although legislation has not yet been introduced, there have been indications that Congress may substantially revise the 1996 Act and other regulation in the next few years. While we believe we are in compliance with federal and state regulatory requirements, our interpretation of our obligations may differ from those of regulatory authorities. Both federal and state regulators require us to pay various fees and assessments, file periodic reports and comply with various rules regarding our consumer marketing practices and the contents of our bills, on an on-going basis. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we may be subject to fines or potentially be asked to show cause as to why our licenses to provide service should not be revoked.\nIncreased competition may adversely affect growth, require increased capital expenditures, result in the loss of existing customers and decrease our revenues.\nWe face competition in the markets in which we operate. For example:\n\u00b7\nIn the United States, our greatest competitive risk to our wireless business is the possibility that our current roaming customers may elect to build or enhance their own networks within the rural market in which we currently provide service, which is commonly known as \u201cover-building.\u201d If our roaming customers, who generally have greater financial resources and access to capital than we do, determine to over-build our network, their need for our roaming services will be significantly reduced or eliminated.\n\u00b7\nIn Guyana, we have faced competition from Digicel, a wireless service provider operating across the region.\n\u00b7\nIn Bermuda and the Caribbean, we compete primarily against Digicel.\n\u00b7\nIn New England and New York State, in addition to other competitive voice and data communications service providers, we compete with much larger regional carriers and national cable providers, each of which has greater financial and other resources.\n\u00b7\nIn our solar power business, we face competition from traditional utilities and renewable energy companies. Many of our competitors are larger with greater resources and are less dependent on third parties for the sourcing of equipment or operation and maintenance of their solar facilities.\nOver the last decade, an increase in competition in many areas of the telecommunications industry has contributed to a decline in prices for communication services, including mobile wireless services, local and long-distance telephone service, and data services. Increased competition in the industry may decrease prices further. In addition, increased competition in the telecommunications and renewable energy industries could reduce our customer base, require us to invest in new facilities and capabilities and reduce revenues, margins and returns.\nGeneral economic factors, domestically and internationally, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services, require a change in the services we sell or have a significant impact in our operating costs. Energy costs are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, or weather conditions. Rapid and significant changes in these and other commodity\nprices may affect our sales and profit margins. General economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war, acts of terrorism, or other significant national or international events.\n\u00b7\nIn addition, an economic downturn in our markets or the global market may lead to slower economic activity, increased unemployment, concerns about inflation, decreased consumer confidence and other adverse business conditions that could have an impact on our businesses. For example, among other things:\n\u00b7\nA decrease in tourism could negatively affect revenues and growth opportunities from operations in the islands and in a number of areas covered by U.S. rural and wholesale wireless operations that serve tourist destinations.\n\u00b7\nAn increase in \u201cbad debt\u201d, or the amounts that we have to write off of our accounts receivable could result from our inability to collect subscription fees from our subscribers.\n\u00b7\nWe rely on the population of Guyanese living abroad who initiate calls to Guyana or are responsible for remittances to relatives living in Guyana. A prolonged economic downturn in the U.S. or Canadian economies could affect inbound calling and, therefore, our revenue in Guyana.\n\u00b7\nThe impact, if any, that these events might have on us and our business, is uncertain.\nFailure of network or information technology systems, including as a result of security breaches, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are highly dependent on our information technology (IT) systems for the operation of our network, or Facilities delivery of services to our customers and compilation of our financial results. Failure of these IT systems, through cyberattacks, breaches of security, or otherwise, may cause disruptions to our operations. Our inability to operate our network, Facilities and back office systems as a result of such events, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses and/ impact the timely and accurate delivery of our services or other information. Other risks that may also cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for our telecommunications customers include power loss, capacity limitations, software defects and breaches of security by computer viruses, break-ins or otherwise. Disruptions in our networks and the unavailability of our services or our inability to efficiently and effectively complete necessary technology or systems upgrades or conversions could lead to a loss of customers, damage to our reputation and violation of the terms of our licenses and contracts with customers. These failures could also lead to significant negative publicity, regulatory problems and litigation.\nOur foreign operations are subject to economic, political and other risks that could adversely affect our revenues or financial position.\nOur international operations may face adverse financial consequences and operational problems due to foreign political or economic changes, such as changes in national or regional political or economic conditions, laws and regulations that restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds, or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Any of these changes could adversely affect our revenues or financial position.\nOur ability to recruit and retain experienced management and technical personnel could adversely affect our results of operations and ability to maintain internal controls.\nThe success of our business is largely dependent on our executive officers and the officers of our operating units, as well as on our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified technical and management personnel. We believe that there is, and will continue to be, strong competition for qualified personnel in the communications industry and in our markets, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business. We rely heavily on local management to run our operating units. Many of the markets we operate in are small and remote, making it difficult to attract and retain talented and qualified managers and staff in those markets. The loss of key personnel or the failure to attract or retain personnel with the sophistication to run complicated\ntelecommunications equipment, networks and systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not currently maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on any of our key employees and none of the executives at our parent company are under employment agreements.\nIn addition, cultural differences abroad and local practices of conducting business in our foreign operations may not be in line with the business practices, recordkeeping and ethics standards in the United States. In order to continue to ensure compliance with foreign and U.S. laws, accounting standards and our own corporate policies, we have implemented financial and operational controls, created an internal audit team responsible for monitoring and ensuring compliance with our internal accounting controls, and routinely train our employees, vendors and consultants. However, having substantial foreign operations also increases the complexity and difficulty of developing, implementing and monitoring these internal controls and procedures. If we are unable to manage these risks effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in meteorological conditions may materially disrupt our operations.\nMany of the areas in which we operate have experienced severe weather conditions over the years including hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, damaging storms and floods. Some areas in which we operate may also be at risk of earthquakes. Such events may materially disrupt and adversely affect our business operations. Major hurricanes passed directly over Bermuda in 2003 and 2014 causing major damage to our network and to the island\u2019s infrastructure. In 2008, a hurricane caused extensive damage on a small portion of the U.S. Virgin Islands. Guyana has suffered from severe rains and flooding in the past as well. Our solar production at our facilities in Massachusetts was negatively impacted in early 2015 by repeated heavy snowfall and prolonged cold weather. While these events have not had a significant negative impact on the operating results or financial condition of the affected businesses or our overall business, we cannot be sure that these types of events will not have such an impact in the future or that the insurance coverage we maintain for asset damage will adequately compensate us for all damage and economic losses resulting from natural catastrophes.\nThe electricity produced and revenues generated by a solar electric generation facility is highly dependent on suitable solar and associated weather conditions and our solar panels and inverters could be damaged by severe weather, such as hailstorms, blizzards or tornadoes. In addition, replacement and spare parts for key components may be difficult or costly to acquire or may be unavailable. Unfavorable weather and atmospheric conditions could reduce the output of our Facilities and lead to a loss of revenue from our offtakers.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nOur debt instruments include restrictive and financial covenants that limit our operating flexibility.\nOur credit facility requires us to maintain a ratio of indebtedness to EBITDA and contains certain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to take specific actions, even if we believe such actions are in our best interest. These include restrictions on our ability to do the following:\n\u00b7\nincur additional debt;\n\u00b7\ncreate liens or negative pledges with respect to our assets;\n\u00b7\npay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, our capital stock;\n\u00b7\nmake investments, loans or advances or other forms of payments;\n\u00b7\nissue, sell or allow distributions on capital stock of specified subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nenter into transactions with affiliates; or\n\u00b7\nmerge, consolidate or sell our assets.\nAny failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit facility or any subsequent financing agreements may result in an event of default. Such default may allow our creditors to accelerate the repayment of the related debt and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, these creditors may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to provide us with further funds.\nOur Chairman is our largest stockholder and will continue to exert significant influence over us.\nCornelius B. Prior, Jr., our Chairman and the father of our Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns, together with related entities, affiliates and family members (including our Chief Executive Officer), approximately 30% of our outstanding Common Stock. As a result, he is able to exert significant influence over all matters presented to our stockholders for approval, including election and removal of our directors and change of control transactions. In addition, as our Chairman, he has the ability to exert significant influence over other matters brought before our Board of Directors, such as proposed changes in our strategy or business plans and our major financing decisions.
