Risk Factors\nOur business, as well as an investment in our common stock, are highly speculative in nature and involve a high degree of risk. Our securities should be purchased only by persons who can afford to lose their entire investment. Carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included herein, including the financial statements and related notes, before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, they could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In such event(s), the market price of our common stock could decline and result in a loss of part or all of your investment. Accordingly, prospective investors should carefully consider, along with other matters referred to herein, the following risk factors in evaluating our business before purchasing any shares of our common stock.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Products and Product Candidates\nThe commercial success of Chenodal\u00ae and Thiola\u00ae depends on them being considered to be effective drugs with advantages over other therapies.\nThe commercial success of our products Chenodal\u00ae and Thiola\u00ae depends on them being considered to be effective drugs with certain advantages over other therapies. A number of factors, as discussed in greater detail below, may adversely impact the degree of acceptance of these products, including their efficacy, safety, price and benefits over competing therapies, as well as the reimbursement policies of third-party payers, such as government and private insurance plans.\nIf unexpected adverse events are reported in connection with the use of any of these products, physician and patient acceptance of the product could deteriorate and the commercial success of such product could be adversely affected. We are required to report to the FDA events associated with our products relating to death or serious injury. Adverse events could result in additional regulatory controls, such as a requirement for costly post-approval clinical studies or revisions to our approved labeling which could limit the indications or patient population for a product or could even lead to the withdrawal of a product from the market.\nIf physicians, patients and third-party payers do not accept our products, we may be unable to generate significant revenues.\nOur drugs may not gain or maintain market acceptance among physicians and patients. Effectively marketing our products and any of our drug candidates, if approved, requires substantial efforts, both prior to launch and after approval. Physicians may elect not to prescribe our drugs, and patients may elect not to request or take them, for a variety of reasons including:\n\u2022 lower demonstrated efficacy, safety and/or tolerability compared to other drugs;\n\u2022 prevalence and severity of adverse side-effects;\n\u2022 lack of cost-effectiveness;\n\u2022 lack of coverage and adequate reimbursement availability from third-party payers;\n\u2022 a decision to wait for the approval of other therapies in development that have significant perceived advantages over our drug;\n\u2022 convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022 other potential advantages of alternative treatment methods; and\n\u2022 ineffective marketing and/or distribution support.\nIf our drugs fail to achieve or maintain market acceptance, we will not be able to generate significant revenues.\nChanges in reimbursement practices of third-party payers could affect the demand for our products and the prices at which they are sold.\nOur products are sold to specialty pharmacies which receive reimbursement for the healthcare services provided to their patients from third-party payers, such as government programs, private insurance plans and managed-care programs. These third-party payers are\nincreasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for medical products and services. Levels of reimbursement, if any, may be decreased in the future, and future healthcare reform legislation, regulations or changes to reimbursement policies of third party payers may otherwise adversely affect the demand for and price levels of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nEconomic pressure on state budgets may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for our products. State Medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for which supplemental rebates are not being paid. Managed care organizations continue to seek price discounts and, in some cases, to impose restrictions on the coverage of particular drugs. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid expenses may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by Medicaid programs. This may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding constraint on prices and reimbursement for our products.\nWe are dependent on third parties to manufacture and distribute our pharmaceutical products who may not fulfill their obligations.\nWe have no manufacturing capabilities and rely on Nexgen Pharma and Mission as sole source suppliers for manufacturing of Chenodal\u00ae and Thiola\u00ae, respectively. The facilities used by our third party manufacturers must be approved by the FDA. Our dependence on third parties for the manufacture of our products may harm our profit margin on the sale of products and our ability to deliver products on a timely and competitive basis. If our third party manufacturers are unable to manufacture to specifications or in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, our ability to commercialize our products will be adversely impacted and could affect our ability to gain market acceptance for our products and negatively impact our revenues.\nWe currently have no in-house distribution channels for Chenodal\u00ae or Thiola\u00ae and we are dependent on a third-party specialty distributor, Dohmen Life Sciences Services to distribute such products. We rely on this distributor for all of our proceeds from sales of Chenodal\u00ae and Thiola\u00ae in the United States. The outsourcing of our distribution function is complex, and we may experience difficulties that could reduce, delay or stop shipments of such products. If we encounter such distribution problems, and we are unable to quickly enter into a similar agreement with another specialty distributor on substantially similar terms, distribution of Chenodal\u00ae or Thiola\u00ae could become disrupted, resulting in lost revenues, provider dissatisfaction, and/or patient dissatisfaction.\nThe independent clinical investigators and contract research organizations that we rely on to conduct our clinical trials may not be diligent, careful or timely and may make mistakes in the conduct of our trials.\nWe depend on independent clinical investigators and contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) to conduct our clinical trials under agreements with us. The CROs play a significant role in the conduct of our clinical trials. Failure of the CROs to meet their obligations could adversely affect clinical development of our product candidates. The independent clinical investigators are not our employees and we cannot control the timing or amount of resources they devote to our studies. If their performance is substandard, it could delay or prevent approval of our FDA applications.\nOur clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval.\nOur efforts to develop certain of our product candidates are at an early stage. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and initial results from a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. We cannot assure that any future clinical trials of sparsentan, RE-024 and RE-034 will ultimately be successful.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates, we must conduct extensive preclinical tests to demonstrate the safety of our product candidates in animals. Preclinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, and can take many years to complete. A failure of one or more of our preclinical studies can occur at any stage of testing. We have not filed an IND for RE-024, though the Company is targeting U.S. IND for RE-024 for 2015. Although we are currently exploring strategic alternatives for development of RE-034, which could be enabled for a U.S. IND in 2015, we cannot be certain that we will ever file INDs for RE-024 and RE-034.\nIf we successfully file INDs on our product candidates, we will only obtain regulatory approval to commercialize product candidates if we can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA, or applicable non-United States regulatory authorities, in well-designed and conducted clinical trials, that our product candidates are safe and effective and otherwise meet the appropriate standards required for approval for a particular indication.\nThere can be no assurance that the DUET Phase 2 clinical study for sparsentan will demonstrate that sparsentan is safe and effective for\ntreating FSGS or that the data will support an application for accelerated FDA approval.\nClinical trials can be lengthy, complex and extremely expensive processes with uncertain results. Our product candidates are intended to treat IS, NS, PKAN and FSGS, each of which is a rare disease. Given that these development candidates are in the early stages of required testing, we may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we are unable to locate a sufficient number of eligible patients willing and able to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA or other non-United States regulatory agencies. For example, our ability to complete the sparsenten Duet study is dependent upon ability to enroll FSGS patients. Our inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for any of our current or future clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. To date, we are not aware of any product to treat PKAN or FSGS that has been approved by the FDA. As a result, we cannot be sure what endpoints the FDA will require us to measure in later-stage clinical trials of our product candidates.\nFDA approval for a product requires substantial or extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting documentation. The approval process may take years and may involve on-going requirements as well as post marketing obligations. FDA approval once obtained, may be withdrawn. If the regulatory approval for Thiola\u00ae and/or Chenodal\u00ae are withdrawn for any reason, it would have a material adverse impact on our sales and profitability. Further, we face the risk that the FDA will not approve cholic acid or approval will be delayed as well as risks relating to the approved cholic acid labeling, postmarking obligations and commercial acceptance.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, preclinical testing and the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our ability to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u00b7 our preclinical tests or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical trials or we may abandon projects that we expect to be promising;\n\u00b7 regulators may require us to conduct studies of the long-term effects associated with the use of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u00b7 the FDA or any non-United States regulatory authority may impose conditions on us regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials or may require us to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to institutional review boards for re-inspection due to changes in the regulatory environment;\n\u00b7 the number of patients required for our clinical trials may be larger than we anticipate or participants may drop out of our clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u00b7 our third-party contractors or clinical investigators may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or fail to meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner;\n\u00b7 we might have to suspend or terminate one or more of our clinical trials if we, regulators or institutional review boards determine that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u00b7 regulators or institutional review boards may require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7 the cost of our clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u00b7 the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials may be insufficient or inadequate or we may not be able to reach agreements on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations; and\n\u00b7 the effects of our product candidates may not be the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or the product candidates may have other unexpected characteristics.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u00b7 be delayed in obtaining, or may not be able to obtain, marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as intended or entirely different than those indications for which we sought approval; and\n\u00b7 have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nOur product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals. We do not know whether any preclinical tests or clinical trials will be initiated as planned, will need to be restructured or will be completed on schedule, if at all. Significant preclinical or clinical trial delays also could shorten the patent protection period during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates. Such delays could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our products or product candidates.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications, and in turn prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and generating revenues from their sale.\nIn addition, if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by the product:\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may require the addition of restrictive labeling statements;\n\u00b7 regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product; and\n\u00b7 we may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing the product candidate, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from its sale or adversely affect our reputation.\nWe face substantial risks related to the commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the acquisition and development of our most advanced product candidates, sparsentan,RE-024 and RE-034. Our ability to generate product revenue from these development stage compounds, which we do not expect will occur for at least the next several years, if ever, may depend heavily on the successful development and commercialization of these product candidates. The successful commercialization of our future product candidates will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u00b7 obtaining supplies of RE-034 and RE-024, sparsentan and subsequent product candidates for completion of our clinical trials on a timely basis;\n\u00b7 successful completion of pre-clinical and clinical studies;\n\u00b7 obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States;\n\u00b7 establishing commercial-scale manufacturing arrangements with third-party manufacturers whose manufacturing facilities are operated in compliance with cGMP regulations;\n\u00b7 launching commercial sales of the product, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u00b7 acceptance of the product by patients, the medical community and third-party payers;\n\u00b7 competition from other companies;\n\u00b7 successful protection of our intellectual property rights from competing products in the United States and abroad; and\n\u00b7 a continued acceptable safety and efficacy profile of our product candidates following approval.\nCompanies may not promote drugs for \u201coff-label\u201d uses-that is, uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and that differ\nfrom those approved by the FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies. A company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions. In addition, management\u2019s attention could be diverted from our business operations and our reputation could be damaged.\nWe may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates. If our competitors are able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for their products that are the same drug as our product candidates, we may not be able to have competing products approved by the applicable regulatory authority for a significant period of time.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Although we have obtained orphan designation for Chenodal\u00ae and sparsentan and expect to seek orphan drug designations from the FDA for RE-024 and RE-034, there can be no assurance that there will be any benefits associated with such designation, or that the FDA will grant orphan status. We also expect to seek drug orphan designation from the European Medicines Agency (the \u201cEMA\u201d), for sparsentan,RE-024 and RE-034. There can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain such designation. If we are unable to secure orphan status in either Europe or the United States it may have a material negative effect on our share price.\nGenerally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, that product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the applicable regulatory authority from approving another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for that time period. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in Europe. Obtaining orphan drug exclusivity for RE-034, RE-024, and sparsentan may be important to the product candidate\u2019s success. Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for RE-034, RE-024 for PKAN, sparsentan for FSGS, we may not be able to maintain it. For example, if a competitive product that contains the same active moiety and treats the same disease as our product candidate is shown to be clinically superior to our product candidate, any orphan drug exclusivity we have obtained will not block the approval of such competitive product and we may effectively lose what had previously been orphan drug exclusivity. Similarly, if a competitive product that contains the same active moiety and treats the same disease as our product candidate is approved before our product candidate is approved, we may not be able to obtain approval for our product candidate until the expiration of the competitive product\u2019s orphan drug exclusivity unless our product candidate is shown to be clinically superior to the competitive product.\nOur products may not achieve or maintain expected levels of market acceptance or commercial success.\nThe success of our products is dependent upon achieving and maintaining market acceptance. Commercializing products is time consuming, expensive and unpredictable. There can be no assurance that we will be able to, either by ourselves or in collaboration with our partners or through our licensees, successfully commercialize new products or gain market acceptance for such products. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited or no commercial success.\nFurther, the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate (or are perceived to implicate) an entire class of products could have an adverse effect on sales of the affected products. Accordingly, new data about our products, or products similar to our products, could negatively impact demand for our products due to real or perceived side effects or uncertainty regarding efficacy and, in some cases, could result in product withdrawal.\nAny products that we bring to the market, including sparsentan, RE-024 and RE-034 if they receive marketing approval-may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payers, and others in the medical community. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue and we may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 the prevalence and severity of any side effects, including any limitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u00b7 the efficacy and potential advantages over alternative treatments;\n\u00b7 the pricing of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u00b7 the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u00b7 the strength of marketing and distribution support and timing of market introduction of competitive products;\n\u00b7 publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments; and\n\u00b7 sufficient third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement.\nEven if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical and clinical trials, market acceptance of the product will not be known until after it is launched. Our efforts to educate patients, the medical community, and third-party payers on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful. Such efforts to educate the marketplace may require more resources than are required by the conventional technologies marketed by our competitors.\nIf the market opportunities for our product candidates are smaller than we believe they are, our revenues may be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nCertain of the diseases that our current and future product candidates are being developed to address, such as IS, NS, PKAN, and FSGS are relatively rare. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, may not be accurate.\nCurrently, most reported estimates of the prevalence of IS, NS, PKAN and FSGS are based on studies of small subsets of the population of specific geographic areas, which are then extrapolated to estimate the prevalence of the diseases in the broader world population. As new studies are performed the estimated prevalence of these diseases may change. There can be no assurance that the prevalence of IS, NS, PKAN, or FSGS in the study populations accurately reflect the prevalence of these diseases in the broader world population. If our estimates of the prevalence of IS, NS, PKAN, or FSGS or of the number of patients who may benefit from treatment with sparsentan, RE-024 and RE-034 prove to be incorrect, the market opportunities for our product candidates may be smaller than we believe they are, our prospects for generating revenue may be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nWe do not currently have patent protection for certain of our product candidates. If we are unable to obtain and maintain protection for the intellectual property relating to our technology and products, the value of our technology and products will be adversely affected.\nOur success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection in the United States and other countries for the intellectual property covering, or incorporated into, our technology and products. The patent situation in the field of biotechnology and pharmaceuticals generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal, technical, scientific and factual questions. We may not be able to obtain additional issued patents relating to our technology or products. Even if issued, patents issued to us or our licensors may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, held to be unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or reduce the term of patent protection we may have for our products. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. We filed a U.S. patent application on RE-024 in April 2012, for which we received a notice of allowance from the United States Patent and Trademark Office in January 2014. We have licensed composition of matter patents on sparsentan that expire in 2019. Currently we have no patent protection on RE-034. We expect that in addition to the protection afforded by our patent filings that we will be able to obtain five years regulatory exclusively via the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, for products we develop based on a new chemical entity not previously approved by the FDA, and up to five years patent term extension (to compensate for regulatory approval delay) for a patent covering such a product.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u00b7 we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications;\n\u00b7 we or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u00b7 others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u00b7 any patents issued to us or our licensors that provide a basis for commercially viable products will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties;\n\u00b7 we will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u00b7 we will file patent applications for new proprietary technologies promptly or at all;\n\u00b7 the claims we make in our patents will be upheld by patent offices in the United States and elsewhere;\n\u00b7 our patents will not expire prior to or shortly after commencing commercialization of a product; and\n\u00b7 the patents of others will not have a negative effect on our ability to do business.\nWe have filed a patent application in the United States on the composition of RE-024 as a treatment for PKAN Further, we have not filed for patent protection outside of the United States for RE-024. We cannot be certain that we will file for patent protection outside the\nUnited States, or that, even if we do, any patents(s) will be granted.\nWe have negotiated a license agreement for the rights to sparsentan which we are initially using in connection with the treatment of FSGS, from Ligand. Further, this license subjects us to various commercialization, reporting and other obligations. If we were to default on our obligations, we could lose our rights to sparsentan. We cannot be certain when or if we will file for patent protection for different indications for sparsentan, if we would be successful in obtaining these patents, or if we will be able to enforce these patents. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining patents for different uses of sparsentan, we may not be able to stop competitors from marketing similar products.\nOur patents also may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology. Because patent applications in the United States and many other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, neither we nor our licensors can be certain that we or they were the first to make the inventions claimed in our or their issued patents or pending patent applications, or that we or they were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in these patent applications. If a third party has also filed a United States patent application prior to the effective date of the relevant provisions of the America Invests Act (i.e. before March 16, 2013) covering our product candidates or a similar invention, we may have to participate in an adversarial proceeding, known as an interference, declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial and it is possible that our efforts could be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our United States patent position.\nWe cannot assure you that third parties will not assert patent or other intellectual property infringement claims against us with respect to technologies used in our products. If patent infringement suits were brought against us, we may be unable to commercialize some of our products which could severely harm our business. Litigation proceedings, even if not successful, may result in substantial costs and harm our business.\nAdditional competitors could enter the market, including with generic versions of our products, and sales of affected products may decline materially.\nUnder the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, a pharmaceutical manufacturer may file an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, seeking approval of a generic copy of an approved innovator product. Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, a manufacturer may also submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) that relies on the FDA\u2019s prior findings of safety and effectiveness in approving the innovator product. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be for a new or improved version of the original innovator product. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also provide for certain periods of regulatory exclusivity, which preclude FDA approval (or in some circumstances, FDA filing and reviewing) of an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA. In addition, the FDC Act provides, subject to certain exceptions, a period during which an FDA-approved drug may be afforded orphan drug exclusivity. In addition to the benefits of regulatory exclusivity, an innovator NDA holder may have patents claiming the active ingredient, product formulation or an approved use of the drug, which would be listed with the product in the FDA publication, \u201cApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,\u201d known as the \u201cOrange Book.\u201d If there are patents listed in the Orange Book, a generic or Section 505(b)(2) applicant that seeks to market its product before expiration of the patents must include in the ANDA what is known as a \u201cParagraph IV certification,\u201d challenging the validity or enforceability of, or claiming non-infringement of, the listed patent or patents. Notice of the certification must be given to the innovator, too, and if within 45 days of receiving notice the innovator sues to protect its patents, approval of the ANDA is stayed for 30 months, or as lengthened or shortened by the court.\nChenodal\u00ae and Thiola\u00ae are subject to immediate competition from generic entrants, as the ANDA and NDA for these drug products have no remaining patent or nonpatent exclusivity.\nUse of third parties to manufacture and distribute our product candidates may increase the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our product candidates or such quantities at an acceptable cost, and clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed, prevented or impaired.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of our products. We have limited personnel with experience in drug manufacturing and we lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. We outsource all manufacturing and packaging of our preclinical, clinical, and commercial products to third parties. The manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up initial production and in maintaining required quality control. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields and quality control, including stability of the product candidate.\nWe do not currently have any agreements with third-party manufacturers for the long-term commercial supply of any of our development stage product candidates. We may be unable to enter into agreements for commercial supply with third-party manufacturers, or may be unable to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we enter into these agreements, the manufacturers of each product candidate will be single source suppliers to us for a significant period of time.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we may not be subject if we manufactured our product candidates or products ourselves, including:\n\u00b7 reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u00b7 limitations on supply availability resulting from capacity and scheduling constraints of the third parties;\n\u00b7 impact on our reputation in the marketplace if manufacturers of our products fail to meet the demands of our customers;\n\u00b7 the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our control; and\n\u00b7 the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us.\nThe failure of any of our contract manufacturers to maintain high manufacturing standards could result in injury or death of clinical trial participants or patients using products. Such failure could also result in product liability claims, product recalls, product seizures or withdrawals, delays or failures in testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business or profitability.\nOur contract manufacturers will be required to adhere to FDA regulations setting forth cGMP. These regulations cover all aspects of the manufacturing, testing, quality control and recordkeeping relating to our product candidates and any products that we may commercialize. Our manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our manufacturers are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA, state regulators and similar regulators outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect regulatory approval and supplies of our product candidates.\nOur product and any products that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that are both capable of manufacturing for us and willing to do so. If the third parties that we engage to manufacture products for our developmental or commercial products should cease to continue to do so for any reason, we likely would experience interruptions in cash flows and/or delays in advancing our clinical trials while we identify and qualify replacement suppliers, and we may be unable to obtain replacement supplies on terms that are favorable to us. Later relocation to another manufacturer will also require notification, review and other regulatory approvals from the FDA and other regulators and will subject our production to further cost and instability in the availability of our product candidates. In addition, if we are not able to obtain adequate supplies of our product candidates, or the drug substances used to manufacture them, it will be more difficult for us to sell our products and to develop our product candidates. This could greatly reduce our competiveness.\nOur current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to develop product candidates and commercialize any products that obtain regulatory approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do. Our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nWe face competition from pharmaceutical companies in the IS, NS, and FSGS indications and will likely face similar competition in other indications, including PKAN, because competition in the area of pharmaceutical products is intense.\nFor example, Questcor Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\u2019s product H.P. Acthar Gel is a formula of ACTH that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of IS and NS. In addition, Apo Pharma Inc. and Treat Iron-Related Childhood-Onset Neurodegeneration (\u201cTIRCON\u201d) are sponsoring clinical studies of Deferiprone as a potential treatment for PKAN. Also, we believe that TIRCON is working on a possible treatment for PKAN using pantethine derivatives.\nAdditionally, there are clinical studies underway evaluating possible treatments for FSGS. For example, Sanofi (Genzyme) is engaged in a Phase 2 clinical study of Fresolimumab to treat FSGS, and Sunnybrook Medical Center has announced plans for a Phase 2 clinical study of Rituxan to treat FSGS. Also, Fibrogen is developing an anti-Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF) antibody as a possible treatment for FSGS.\nSeveral of our competitors have substantially greater financial, research and development, distribution, manufacturing and marketing\nexperience and resources than we do and represent substantial long-term competition for us. Other companies may succeed in developing and marketing products that are more effective and/or less costly than any products that may be developed and marketed by Retrophin, or that are commercially accepted before any of our products. Factors affecting competition in the pharmaceutical and drug industries vary, depending on the extent to which a competitor is able to achieve a competitive advantage based on its proprietary technology and ability to market and sell drugs. If we are able to establish and maintain a significant proprietary position with respect to our products, competition likely will depend primarily on the effectiveness and ease of administration and product compliance as compared to alternative products. The industry in which we compete is characterized by extensive research and development efforts and rapid technological progress. Although we believe that our proprietary position may give us a competitive advantage with respect to sparsentan and RE-024, new developments are expected to continue and there can be no assurance that discoveries by others will not render such potential products noncompetitive.\nOur competitive position also depends on our ability to enter into strategic alliances with one or more large pharmaceutical and contract manufacturing companies, attract and retain qualified personnel, develop effective proprietary products, implement development and marketing plans, obtain patent protection, secure adequate capital resources and successfully sell and market our approved products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully achieve all of the foregoing objectives.\nMaterials necessary to manufacture our product candidates may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which may delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe rely on the manufacturers of our product candidates to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce the compounds for our preclinical and clinical studies and will rely on these other manufacturers for commercial distribution if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates. Suppliers may not sell these materials to our manufacturers at the time we need them or on commercially reasonable terms and all such prices are susceptible to fluctuations in price and availability due to transportation costs, government regulations, price controls, changes in economic climate or other foreseen circumstances. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these materials by our manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these materials. If our manufacturers are unable to obtain these materials for our preclinical and clinical studies, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates would be delayed, significantly impacting our ability to develop our product candidates. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates, the commercial launch of our product candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would materially affect our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidates.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, when and if any of them are approved.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes and facilities, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration requirements, cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if we obtain regulatory approval of a product, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. We also may be subject to state laws and registration requirements covering the distribution of our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:\n\u00b7 restrictions on such products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7 warning letters;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u00b7 refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u00b7 voluntary or mandatory recall;\n\u00b7 fines;\n\u00b7 suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals or refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u00b7 refusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u00b7 product seizure or detentions;\n\u00b7 injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; and\n\u00b7 adverse publicity.\nIf we, or our suppliers, third-party contractors, clinical investigators or collaborators are slow to adapt, or are unable to adapt, to changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new regulatory requirements or policies, we or our collaborators may lose marketing approval for our products when and if any of them are approved, resulting in decreased revenue from milestones, product sales or royalties.\nAny drugs we develop may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, thereby harming our business.\nThe business and financial condition of healthcare-related businesses will continue to be affected by efforts of governments and third-party payers to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare through various means. In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval for RE-034, RE-024, and sparsentan, or any other product candidate that we develop, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell sparsentan, RE-024 and RE-034 or any other product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. It is not clear whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of any Retrophin products, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject Retrophin to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nFor example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the \u201cHealth Care Reform Law\u201d), a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The Health Care Reform Law revised the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, the law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drug products. Although it is too early to determine the full effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nIf we are unable to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from governments or third-party payers for any products that we may develop or if we are unable to obtain acceptable prices for those products, our prospects for generating revenue and achieving profitability will suffer.\nOur prospects for generating revenue and achieving profitability will depend heavily upon the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement for the use of our approved product candidates from governmental and other third-party payers, both in the United States and in other markets. Reimbursement by a third-party payer may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payer\u2019s determination that use of a product is:\n\u00b7 a covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u00b7 safe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u00b7 appropriate for the specific patient;\n\u00b7 cost-effective; and\n\u00b7 neither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining reimbursement approval for a product from each government or other third-party payer is a time consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost effectiveness data for the use of our products to each payer. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to reimbursement or we might need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any future products to such payers\u2019 satisfaction. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Even when a payer determines that a product is eligible for reimbursement, the payer may impose coverage limitations that preclude payment for some uses that are approved\nby the FDA or non-United States regulatory authorities. In addition, there is a risk that full reimbursement may not be available for high-priced products. Moreover, eligibility for coverage does not imply that any product will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that allows us to make a profit or even cover our costs. Interim payments for new products, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is toward cost containment. We expect recent changes in the Medicare program and increasing emphasis on managed care to continue to put pressure on pharmaceutical product pricing.\nGovernments outside the United States tend to impose strict price controls and reimbursement approval policies, which may adversely affect our prospects for generating revenue.\nIn some countries, particularly European Union countries, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time (6 to 12 months or longer) after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our prospects for generating revenue, if any, could be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate product revenue.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are an early stage corporation. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects, and our profitability in the future is uncertain. Our independent auditors modified their report on our financial statements to include a paragraph that concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe commenced operations in 2011 and are a new, early stage company. We face the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays, many of which are beyond our control, associated with any business in its early stages and has no operating history on which an evaluation of our prospects can be made. Such prospects should be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered in the establishment of a business in a new industry, characterized by a number of market entrants and intense competition, and in the shift from development to commercialization of new products based on innovative technologies.\nWe expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations. We began 2014 with 26 employees and ended the year with approximately 110 employees having added sales and marketing, compliance and legal functions in addition to expansion of all functions to support a commercial organization. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability on the part of our management to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products without strategic partners or licensees include:\n\u00b7 our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u00b7 the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our products;\n\u00b7 the lack of complementary products to be offered by our sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage against companies with broader product lines;\n\u00b7 unforeseen costs associated with expanding our own sales and marketing team for new products or with entering into a partnering agreement with an independent sales and marketing organization; and\n\u00b7 efforts by our competitors to commercialize competitive products.\nMoreover, though we generate revenues from product sales arrangements, we may incur significant operating losses over the next several years. Our ability to achieve profitable operations in the future will depend in large part upon successful in-licensing of products approved by the FDA, selling and manufacturing these products, completing development of our products, obtaining regulatory approvals for these products, and bringing these products to market. The likelihood of the long-term success of our company must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties and delays frequently encountered in the development and commercialization of new drug products, competitive factors in the marketplace, as well as the regulatory environment in which we operate.\nIn addition, as a new business, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors.\nOur management has identified internal control deficiencies, which our management believes constitute material weaknesses. Any future material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting could harm stockholder and business confidence on our financial reporting, our ability to obtain financing and other aspects of our business.\nIn connection with the preparation of our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 we concluded that a material weakness existed in internal control over financial reporting. Specifically, as of December 31, 2014, our management concluded that the management of and accounting for equity awards and consulting agreements controls were not effective. On February 19, 2015, the Company\u2019s board of directors concluded that as a result of the errors related to such consulting agreements, the financial statements contained in the September 30, 2013 third quarter Form 10-Q and the 2013 Form 10-K should no longer be relied upon. The Company has corrected such errors, including any related disclosures, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we will restate these periods in amendments to the September 30, 2013 Third Quarter Form 10-Q and 2013 Form 10-K. The Company believes that the errors related to such consulting agreements in the 2014 Forms 10-Q do not cause the financial statements contained therein to be misleading, and therefore such financial statements can still be relied upon. The Company has corrected such errors, including any related disclosures, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and will restate those quarters in future Forms 10-Q.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we carried out an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), updated and reissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations, or the COSO Framework. Based on our evaluation under the COSO Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2014. In connection with the above assessment, Retrophin management identified a material weakness in the control environment relating to a certain member of senior management who did not demonstrate the appropriate level of control consciousness and, therefore, did not demonstrate a positive tone at the top of the organization and did not observe a diligent process relating to the review and approval of contracts. In addition, Retrophin\u2019s management also identified a material weakness in the control environment relating to the accounting for equity awards.\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2013, we had identified certain matters that constituted material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, including the fact that we (i) have experienced difficulty in generating data in a form and format that facilitates the timely analysis of information needed to produce accurate financial reports, (ii) have experienced difficulty in applying complex accounting and financial reporting and disclosure rules required under GAAP and the SEC reporting regulations, and (iii) have limited segregation of duties. Although we are committed to continuing to improve our internal control processes, and although we will continue to diligently and vigorously review our internal control over financial reporting, any control system, regardless of how well designed, operated and evaluated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Management is in the process of taking the steps as outlined in Item 9A to remediate the December 31, 2014 material weaknesses. Therefore, we cannot be certain that, in the future, additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not exist or otherwise be discovered. If our efforts to address the weakness identified are not successful, or if other deficiencies occur, these weaknesses or deficiencies could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, a decline in our stock price and investor confidence or other material effects on our business, reputation, financial condition or liquidity.\nOur auditors have expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Independent Registered Public Accounting Firms\u2019 Reports issued in connection with our audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 stated that there is \u201csubstantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern\u201d. Because we have been issued an opinion by our auditors that substantial doubt exists as to whether it can continue as a going concern, it may be more difficult to attract investors. If we are not able to continue our business as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment.\nWe have incurred operating losses since our inception. We expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe believe that our available cash and short-term investments as of the date of this filing will not be sufficient to fund our anticipated level of operations for at least the next 12 months. Management believes the Company\u2019s ability to continue its operations depends on its ability to sustain and grow revenue, results of operations and its ability to access capital markets when necessary to accomplish its strategic objectives. Management believes that we will continue to incur losses for the immediate future. For the year December 31, 2014, the Company has generated revenue and is trying to achieve positive cash flow from operations. The Company expects to finance its cash needs from results of operations and depending on results of operations we may either need additional equity or debt financing, or need to enter into strategic alliances on products in development to sustain our operations until we can achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operating activities, if ever.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had working capital deficit of approximately $70.2 million. Our accumulated deficit amounted to $179.2 million at December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, our stockholders\u2019 deficit was $37.3 million and $19.7 million, respectively. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $110.9 million compared to $34.6 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2013. Net cash used in operating activities was $45.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Operations since inception have been funded primarily with the proceeds from equity and debt financings and beginning in March 2014 from revenue from our three marketed products. As of December 31, 2014, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $27.8 million. We will continue to fund operations from cash on hand, product revenues, and through the similar sources of capital previously described. We can give no assurance that such capital will be available to us on favorable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds in the future on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be forced to curtail our development activities. In addition we could be forced to delay or discontinue product development, and forego attractive business opportunities. Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the sale of our equity securities, which will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.\nWe have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, specifically our preclinical development activities. We have not completed development of any drugs. We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses for at least the next several quarters and we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:\n\u00b7 continue our ongoing preclinical development of RE-034;\n\u00b7 continue our ongoing preclinical development of RE-024 for the treatment of PKAN, and begin Company sponsored clinical trials of RE-024;\n\u00b7 complete Phase 2 clinical development of sparsentan for the treatment of FSGS;\n\u00b7 continue the research and development of additional product candidates;\n\u00b7 seek regulatory approval of RE-034, RE-024, sparsentan, and additional product candidates;\n\u00b7 expand our sales and marketing infrastructure to commercialize new products for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and\n\u00b7 expand operational, financial, and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support product development efforts and our obligations as a public company.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and commercializing drugs with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including the discovery of product candidates, successful completion of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling those products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We are only in the preliminary stages of these activities. We may not be successful enough in these activities to generate revenues that are substantial enough to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become or remain profitable could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in the market price of our common stock may also cause a loss of a part or all of your investment.\nWe will need substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect our general, research and development expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we complete Phase 2 clinical studies of sparsentan, and as we continue toward Phase 1 clinical studies of RE-024 and RE-034 and for any later-stage clinical trials of our product candidates. In addition, subject to obtaining regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses for product sales and marketing, securing commercial quantities of product from our manufacturers, and product distribution. We currently have no additional commitments or arrangements for any additional financing to fund the research and development and commercial launch of our product candidates.\nManagement believes the Company\u2019s ability to continue its operations depends on its ability to sustain and grow revenue, results of operations and its ability to access capital markets when necessary to accomplish its strategic objectives. Management believes that we will continue to incur losses for the immediate future. For the year December 31, 2014, the Company has generated revenue and is trying to achieve positive cash flow from operations. The Company expects to finance its cash needs from results of operations and depending on results of operations we may either need additional equity or debt financing, or need to enter into strategic alliances on products in development to sustain our operations until we can achieve profitability and positive cash flows from operating activities, if ever. Additional funds may not be available to us when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to reduce or eliminate research development programs or commercial efforts.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the progress and results of our pre-clinical and clinical studies of sparsentan, RE-024 and RE-034 and other drug candidates;\n\u00b7 the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we pursue;\n\u00b7 the costs of commercialization activities, including product marketing, sales and distribution;\n\u00b7 the emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments;\n\u00b7 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property related claims;\n\u00b7 the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies; and\n\u00b7 our ability to establish collaborations and obtain milestone, royalty or other payments from any such collaborators.\nThe market price for shares of our common stock may be volatile and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe price of our stock is likely to be volatile. The stock market in general, and the market for biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u00b7 results of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 our entry into or the loss of a significant collaboration;\n\u00b7 regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries, including changes in the health care payment systems;\n\u00b7 variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7 changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u00b7 market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u00b7 general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u00b7 results of clinical trials conducted by others on drugs that would compete with our product candidates;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 public concern over our product candidates or any products approved in the future;\n\u00b7 litigation;\n\u00b7 future sales or anticipated sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders; and\n\u00b7 the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn addition, the stock markets, and in particular, the NASDAQ Global Market, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many pharmaceutical companies. Stock prices of many pharmaceutical companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate new products or businesses we may acquire.\nWe intend to expand our product pipeline by pursuing acquisition of pharmaceutical products. If an acquisition is consummated, the integration of the acquired business, product or other assets into our company may also be complex and time- consuming and, if such businesses, products and assets are not successfully integrated, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits, cost-savings or growth opportunities. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following:\n\u00b7 integrating personnel, operations and systems, while maintaining focus on producing and delivering consistent, high quality products;\n\u00b7 coordinating geographically dispersed organizations;\n\u00b7 distracting employees from operations;\n\u00b7 retaining existing customers and attracting new customers; and\n\u00b7 managing inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of the Company.\nFurthermore, these acquisitions and other arrangements, even if successfully integrated, may fail to further our business strategy as anticipated, expose us to increased competition or challenges with respect to our products or geographic markets, and expose us to additional liabilities associated with an acquired business, product, technology or other asset or arrangement. Any one of these challenges or risks could impair our ability to realize any benefit from our acquisitions or arrangements after we have expended resources on them.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nOur business exposes us to potential liability risks inherent in the research, development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products. If any of our product candidates in clinical trials or marketing products harm people we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims. We have clinical trial insurance and commercial product liability coverage. However, this insurance may not be adequate to cover all claims. We may be exposed to product liability claims and product recalls, including those which may arise from misuse or malfunction of, or design flaws in, such products, whether or not such problems directly relate to the products and services we have provided. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7 decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u00b7 damage to our reputation;\n\u00b7 regulatory investigations that could require costly recalls or product modifications;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7 costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u00b7 substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients, including awards that substantially exceed our product liability insurance, which we would then be required to pay from other sources, if available, and would damage our ability to obtain liability insurance at reasonable costs, or at all, in the future;\n\u00b7 loss of revenue;\n\u00b7 the diversion of management\u2019s attention from managing our business; and\n\u00b7 the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nWe have liability insurance policies for our clinical trials in the geographies in which we are conducting trials. The aggregate annual limit of coverage amount under these policies expressed in United States dollars is approximately $5.0 million, and these policies are also subject to per claim deductibles. The amount of insurance that we currently hold may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost and we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or a series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to fall and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our available cash and adversely affect our business.\nWe are involved in various litigation matters, any of which could result in substantial costs, divert management's attention and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe are involved in various litigation matters, each described below in Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d. Although we intend to vigorously defend any claims for which we have been named as a defendant, there is no guarantee that we will be successful and we may have to pay damages awards or otherwise may enter into settlement arrangements in connection with such claims. Any such payments or settlement arrangements could have material adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition. Even if the pending claims are not successful, litigation with respect to such claims could result in substantial costs and significant adverse impact on our reputation and divert management's attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, we are a plaintiff in a pending lawsuit, and we received a subpoena relating to a criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York. While we are not named as a defendant or otherwise a target of these proceedings, such proceedings could result in substantial costs and significant adverse impact on our reputation and divert management's attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight, which may result in significant additional expense and may limit our commercial success.\nWe are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations, such as safety reporting requirements and additional post-marketing obligations, including regulatory oversight of the promotion and marketing of our products. In addition, the manufacture, quality control, labeling, packaging, safety surveillance, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for our products are subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. If we become aware of previously unknown problems with any of our products, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on our products, our contract manufacturers or us. If we, our products and product candidates, or the manufacturing facilities for our products and product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency, including the FDA, may send enforcement letters, mandate labeling changes, suspend or withdraw regulatory approval, suspend any ongoing clinical trials, refuse to approve pending applications or supplements filed by us, suspend or impose restrictions on manufacturing operations, request a recall of, seize or detain a product, seek criminal prosecution or an injunction, or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines. In such instances, we could experience a significant drop in the sales of the affected products, our product revenues and reputation in the marketplace may suffer, and we could become the target of lawsuits.\nWe are also subject to regulation by regional, national, state and local agencies, including but not limited to the FDA, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other regulatory bodies. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Social Security Act, Public Health Service Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern to varying degrees the research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities relating to prescription pharmaceutical products, including preclinical testing, clinical research, approval, production, labeling, sale, distribution, post-market surveillance, advertising, dissemination of information, promotion, marketing, and pricing to government purchasers and government health care programs. Our manufacturing partners are subject to many of the same requirements.\nThe federal health care program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any health care item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements that pharmaceutical companies have with prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers. Further, the Health Care Reform Law, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Health Care Reform Law provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors under the federal anti-kickback statute protecting certain common manufacturer business arrangements and activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and an arrangement must meet all of the conditions specified in order to be fully protected from scrutiny under the federal anti-kickback statute. We seek to comply with the exceptions and safe harbors whenever possible, but our practices, such as our patient assistance programs and prompt pay discounts with certain customers, may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection from anti-kickback liability and may be subject to scrutiny.\nThe federal false claims laws, including the Federal False Claims Act, prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. Many pharmaceutical and other health care companies have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the Federal False Claims Act for a variety of alleged marketing activities, including providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; providing consulting fees, grants, free travel, and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe the company\u2019s products; and inflating prices reported to private price publication services, which may be used by states to set drug payment rates under government health care programs. Companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the marketing of their products for unapproved uses. Pharmaceutical and other health care companies have also been prosecuted on other legal theories of Medicare and Medicaid fraud.\nAdditionally, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Further, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.\nMany states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, which apply regardless of the payer. Several states now require pharmaceutical companies to report their expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to certain individual health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities, including the provision of gifts, meals, and other items to certain health care providers. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes.\nWe also could become subject to government investigations and related subpoenas. Such subpoenas are often associated with previously filed qui tam actions, or lawsuits filed under seal under the Federal False Claims Act. Qui tam actions are brought by private plaintiffs suing on behalf of the federal government for alleged violations of the Federal False Claims Act. The time and expense associated with responding to such subpoenas, and any related qui tam or other actions, may be extensive, and we cannot predict the results of our review of the responsive documents and underlying facts or the results of such actions. Responding to government investigations, defending any claims raised, and any resulting fines, restitution, damages and penalties, settlement payments or administrative actions, as well as any related actions brought by stockholders or other third parties, could have a material impact on our reputation, business and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business.\nThe number and complexity of both federal and state laws continues to increase, and additional governmental resources are being added to enforce these laws and to prosecute companies and individuals who are believed to be violating them. In particular, the Health Care Reform Law includes a number of provisions aimed at strengthening the government\u2019s ability to pursue anti-kickback and false claims cases against pharmaceutical manufacturers and other healthcare entities, including substantially increased funding for healthcare fraud enforcement activities, enhanced investigative powers, amendments to the federal False Claims Act that make it easier for the government and whistleblowers to pursue cases for alleged kickback and false claim violations and, for payments made on or after August 1, 2013, public reporting of payments by pharmaceutical manufacturers to physicians and teaching hospitals nationwide. While it is too early to predict the full effect these changes will have on our business, we anticipate that government scrutiny of pharmaceutical sales and marketing practices will continue for the foreseeable future and subject us to the risk of further government investigations and enforcement actions. Responding to a government investigation or enforcement action would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information.\nAdditionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the Health Care Reform Law, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies to report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the current regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on our business, if any, may be.\nIf we or any of our partners fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we or they could be subject to a range of regulatory actions that could affect our or our partners' ability to commercialize our products and could harm or prevent sales of the affected products, or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing our products. Any threatened or actual government enforcement action could also generate adverse publicity and require that we devote substantial resources that could otherwise be used in other aspects of our business. Compliance with applicable federal and state laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that violate them may face substantial penalties. The potential sanctions include criminal fines, civil monetary penalties, administrative penalties, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, and imprisonment. Because of the breadth of these laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws. Such a challenge, irrespective of the underlying merits of the challenge or the ultimate outcome of the matter, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf we are not able to obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our products, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nOur product candidates, once approved, and the activities associated with their manufacture, marketing, distribution, and sales are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. Failure to adhere to regulations set out by these bodies for one or more of our commercial products could prevent us from commercializing the product candidate in the jurisdiction of the regulatory authority. We have only limited experience in meeting the regulatory requirements incumbent on the sale of drugs in the United States and elsewhere, and expect to rely on third-parties to assist us in these processes. If these third parties fail to adequately adhere to the regulations governing drug distribution and promotion we may be unable to sell our products, which could have a material effect on our ability to generate revenue.\nOur product candidates and the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by comparable authorities in other countries. Failure to\nobtain regulatory approval for a product candidate will prevent us from commercializing the product candidate in the jurisdiction of the regulatory authority. We have only limited experience in filing and prosecuting the applications necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and expect to rely on third-party contract research organizations to assist us in this process.\nSecuring FDA approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy. Securing FDA approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and successful inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the FDA. Our future products may not be effective, may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use.\nOur product candidates may fail to obtain regulatory approval for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7 our failure to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for a particular indication;\n\u00b7 the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u00b7 our inability to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s benefits outweigh its risks;\n\u00b7 our inability to demonstrate that the product candidate presents an advantage over existing therapies;\n\u00b7 the FDA\u2019s or comparable regulatory authorities\u2019 disagreement with the manner in which we interpret the data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u00b7 failure of the third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical or commercial supplies to satisfactorily complete an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is manufactured to assess compliance with the FDA\u2019s cGMP regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug\u2019s identity, strength, quality and purity; and\n\u00b7 a change in the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities or a change in the laws governing the approval process.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in regulatory approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. The FDA and non-United States regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a product candidate. Any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. Any FDA or other regulatory approval of our product candidates, once obtained, may be withdrawn, including for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or if clinical or manufacturing problems follow initial marketing.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness and Investments\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we have approximately $83.8 million of total debt outstanding, of which $40.5 million is classified as current and $43.3 million is classified as long term. The total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2014 consists of the $45 million Credit Agreement dated June 30, 2014 (\u201cCredit Facility\u201d) as amended July 16, 2014, November 13, 2014 and January 12, 2015, and the Note Purchase Agreement dated May 29, 2014 relating to the private placement of $46.0 million aggregate senior secured notes (the \u201cNotes\u201d). As a result of our substantial indebtedness, a significant portion of our cash flow will be required to pay interest and principal on our Note Payable and interest and principal on the Notes if the Notes are not converted to shares of common stock prior to maturity. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or have future borrowings available to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u00b7 make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt;\n\u00b7 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness and related interest, including indebtedness we may incur in the future, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital\nexpenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7 increase our cost of borrowing;\n\u00b7 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have less debt; and\n\u00b7 limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes.\nWe expect to use cash flow from operations and outside financings to meet our current and future financial obligations, including funding our operations, debt service and capital expenditures. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures, sell assets, obtain additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including our senior secured term loan and the Notes, on or before maturity. We cannot make any assurances that we will be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future indebtedness may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.\nDespite current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, we may still be able to incur more debt or make certain restricted payments, which could further exacerbate the risks described above.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional debt in the future. Although our Credit Facility contains restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make restricted payments, those restrictions are subject to a number of exceptions. We may also consider investments in joint ventures or acquisitions, which may increase our indebtedness. Adding new debt to current debt levels or making restricted payments could intensify the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face. The Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of December 31, 2014. The Company has classified the balance of $40.5 million related to the Credit Facility in current liabilities as of December 31, 2014 since the Company does not expect to be in compliance with the debt covenants within the next 12 months.\nOur Credit Facility restricts our ability to engage in some business and financial transactions.\nOur Credit Facility restricts our and our subsidiaries\u2019 abilities in certain circumstances to, among other things:\n\u00b7 incur additional debt;\n\u00b7 change the nature of their businesses;\n\u00b7 pay dividends and make other distributions on, redeem or repurchase, capital stock;\n\u00b7 make certain investments or other restricted payments;\n\u00b7 enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7 sell all, or substantially all, of our assets;\n\u00b7 create liens on assets to secure debt; or\n\u00b7 effect a consolidation or merger.\nThese covenants limit our operational flexibility and could prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise, growing our business or competing effectively. In addition, our new senior credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure that we will meet these tests and therefore incur additional costs and penalties.\nWe hold a significant stake in Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals which, could pose significant risks to our financial position and our stockholders.\nOn July 17, 2014, we made a proposal to the board of directors of Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals Limited (\u201cClinuvel\u201d) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Clinuvel for either 0.175 shares of common stock of the Company or $2.03 in cash per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $89 million. The proposal was rejected and as of December 31, 2014, we have invested approximately $9.6 million and acquired approximately 6.5% of the outstanding shares of Clinuvel as part of the proposal process. As of March 2, 2015, the Company owned approximately 6.1% of the outstanding shares of Clinuvel. The Company\u2019s intention is liquidate portions of our Clinuvel investment and use the cash generated from stock sales for working capital purposes. Due to the market for Clinuvel\u2019s stock, the Company may not be able to readily liquidate our investment in Clinuvel, as a result, the Company may need to obtain additional equity and/or debt financing to fund operations. Our goal is ultimately to dispose of our shares in Clinuvel and realize gains upon our disposition of such shares. However, the shares we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our interest in Clinuvel, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any shares may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience.\nA default under the Credit Facility or the Notes may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIn the event of a default the Credit Facility, the holders of the indebtedness thereunder generally would be able to declare all of the indebtedness under such term loan, together with accrued interest, to be due and payable. In addition, borrowings under our Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our and our domestic subsidiaries\u2019 assets, subject to certain limited exceptions and, in the event of a default under that facility, the lenders thereunder generally would be entitled to seize the collateral, including assets which are necessary to operate our business.\nIf an event of default under the Notes occurs, the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any) may be declared immediately due and payable, subject to certain conditions set forth in the indenture governing such notes. Events of default include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 failure to pay (for more than 30 days) interest when due;\n\u2022 failure to pay principal when due;\n\u2022 failure to deliver shares of Common Stock upon conversion of a Note;\n\u2022 failure to provide notice of a fundamental change;\n\u2022 acceleration on other indebtedness of the Company in excess of $10 million (other than indebtedness that is non-recourse to the Company); or\n\u2022 certain types of bankruptcy or insolvency involving the Company.\nAccordingly, the occurrence of a default under our Credit Facility or the Notes, unless cured or waived, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur ability to make payments on the Notes is partially dependent upon our ability to receive dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries.\nOur subsidiaries are legally distinct from us. Payment to us by our subsidiaries will be contingent upon our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings and other business considerations. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, make distributions, provide loans or make other payments to us may be restricted by applicable state and foreign laws, potentially adverse tax consequences and their agreements, if any, including agreements governing their debt. As a result, we may not be able to access their cash flow to service our debt, including the Notes, and we cannot assure our noteholders that the amount of cash and cash flow of such subsidiaries will be fully available to us.\nThe Notes are structurally subordinated to all obligations of our subsidiaries.\nThe Notes are our obligations and are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables, of our subsidiaries. Additionally, our senior secured term loan is guaranteed by our subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of their assets.\nThe effect of this structural subordination is that, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding involving a subsidiary which is not a guarantor of the Notes, the assets of the affected entity could not be used to pay noteholders until after all other claims against that subsidiary, including trade payables, have been fully paid.\nThe Notes rank junior to any of our secured indebtedness.\nThe Notes are our general unsecured obligations; they are not secured by any of our assets or those of our subsidiaries. The Notes effectively rank junior to any secured indebtedness, including the Credit Facility and any other secured indebtedness that we may incur. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up, our assets that secure debt will be available to pay obligations on the Notes only after all debt under such secured debt has been repaid in full from such assets. As a result, it is likely that there would not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all the Notes then outstanding. In addition, the terms of the Notes allow us to secure unlimited amounts of debt with our assets, all of which would be effectively senior to the Notes to the extent of the value of such assets.\nProvisions of the Notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party.\nCertain provisions of the Notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for or prevent a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change, holders of the Notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their Notes or any portion of the principal amount of such Notes in integral multiples of $1,000. We may also be required to increase the conversion rate for conversions in connection with certain fundamental changes.\nConversion of the Notes may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their Notes.\nTo the extent we issue shares of common stock upon conversion of the Notes, the conversion of some or all of the Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of shares of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of shares of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could depress the price of shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14440, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "RTRX"}
