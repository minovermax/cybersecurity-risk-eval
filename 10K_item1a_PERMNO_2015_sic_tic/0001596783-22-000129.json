RISK FACTORS\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected. Additional risks or uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently believe are immaterial, may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and the Industry in Which We Operate\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected by global health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAny public health epidemic, including the COVID-19 pandemic, may affect our operations and those of third parties on which we rely, including our customers and suppliers. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be affected by: disruptions in our customers\u2019 abilities to fund, develop, or bring to market products as anticipated; delays in or disruptions to the conduct of clinical trials; cancellations of contracts or confirmed orders from our customers; decreased demand for categories of products in certain affected regions; and inability, difficulty, or additional cost or delays in obtaining key raw materials, components, and other supplies from our existing supply chain; among other factors caused by a public health epidemic, including the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material negative effect on our overall business, financial condition or results of operations to date, our customers and suppliers have in some cases experienced negative impacts due to disruptions in supply chains and disruptions to the operations of the FDA and other drug regulatory authorities, which resulted in, among other things, delays of inspections, reviews, and approvals of our customers\u2019 products, as well as the volume and timing of orders from these customers. Such impacts may affect our business in the future. Governmental restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which continue to evolve, including travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business closures, new safety requirements or regulations, or restrictions on the import or export of certain materials, or other operational issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe continue to monitor developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on our business, operations, and financial condition. For purposes of our operational and financial planning, we have made, and update when appropriate, certain assumptions regarding the duration, severity, and global economic impact of the pandemic in different regions, and the need for continued manufacture and supply of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, each of which remains uncertain. However, despite careful planning, our assumptions may not be accurate, as the extent to which COVID-19 may affect our future results will depend on future developments that are uncertain, including: the duration of the pandemic; emerging information concerning the severity and incidence of the virus and its variants; the emergence of additional virus variants; regional resurgences of the virus globally; the safety, efficacy, and availability of vaccines and treatments for COVID-19 (including its variants); the rate at which the population globally becomes vaccinated against COVID-19; the global economic impact of the pandemic; the actions of governments and regulatory authorities to contain the pandemic or control the supply of vaccines and treatments; and the actions the pharmaceutical industry, competitors, suppliers, customers, patients, and others may take to contain or address the pandemic\u2019s direct and indirect effects.\nOur Biologics segment, in particular, has reported substantial revenue from the testing, manufacturing, and packaging of COVID-19-related products for our customers. While this positive impact is expected to continue through at least the remainder of calendar 2022 and into calendar 2023, the duration and extent of future revenues from such testing, manufacturing, and packaging of COVID-19-related products is uncertain and dependent upon customer demand. See also \"-Risks Related to Our Business and the Industry in Which We Operate-The continually evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting public health response, including the changing demand for various COVID-19 vaccines and treatments from both patients and governments around the world, may affect sales of the COVID-19 products we manufacture.\"\nIn addition, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health epidemic could exacerbate other risks we face, including those described elsewhere in \"Risk Factors.\"\nThe continually evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting public health response, including the changing demand for various COVID-19 vaccines and treatments from both patients and governments around the world, may affect sales of the COVID-19 products we manufacture.\nWe manufacture or provide services for a variety of products intended for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 and its symptoms and effects, including both vaccines and treatments. No single one of these products is material to our business. Certain of these products are subject to \u201ctake-or-pay\u201d provisions that require the customer to either purchase a minimum\namount of product or pay any shortfall resulting from purchases not made. Such provisions should mitigate risks relating to any future uncertainty in the demand for these products.\nThe COVID-19-related products we develop and manufacture have not yet received full marketing approval from certain regulatory authorities around the world for certain patient populations, although some of these are being marketed and sold to such populations pursuant to an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA or the equivalent authorization from non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Should any of these COVID-19-related products be denied any necessary regulatory approval, the demand for such product could decrease significantly and therefore decrease customer orders for additional development, manufacturing, or packaging of those products, although the financial effect on us may be mitigated by any take-or-pay provision in place with respect to that product. Additionally, the need for continued manufacture and supply of vaccines (including \u201cbooster\u201d doses) and therapies to address the COVID-19 pandemic, including new and developing variants of COVID-19, is highly uncertain and subject to various political, economic, and regulatory factors that are outside of our control. Should the U.S. or other major regions worldwide determine that additional manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines, boosters, or therapies is no longer necessary, it could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition. In addition, highly-public political and social debate relating to the need for, efficacy of, or side effects related to one or more specific COVID-19 vaccines could contribute to changes in public perception of one or more COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by us, which could decrease demand for a COVID-19 related product we develop, manufacture, or package.\nThe demand for our offerings depends in part on our customers\u2019 research and development and the clinical and market success of their products. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be harmed if our customers spend less on, or are less successful in, these activities. In addition, customer spending may be affected by, among other things, the COVID-19 pandemic or recessionary economic conditions caused in whole or in part by the pandemic, the Ukrainian-Russian war, or the rise in inflation worldwide.\nOur customers are engaged in research, development, production, and marketing of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and consumer health products. The amount of customer spending on research, development, production, and marketing, as well as the outcomes of such research, development, and marketing activities, have a large impact on our sales and profitability, particularly the amount our customers choose to spend on our offerings. Available resources, including funding for our biotechnology and other customers, the need to develop new products, and consolidation in the industries in which our customers operate may have an impact on such spending. Our customers and potential customers finance their research and development spending from private and public sources. A reduction in available financing for and spending by our customers, for these reasons or because of the direct or indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, and the Ukrainian-Russian war or other regional or global conflicts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If our customers are not successful in attaining or retaining product sales due to market conditions, reimbursement issues, or other factors, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe participate in a highly competitive market, and increased competition may adversely affect our business.\nWe operate in a market that is highly competitive. We compete with multiple companies as to each of our offerings and in every region of the globe in which we operate, including competing with other companies that offer advanced delivery technologies, outsourced dose form or biologics manufacturing, clinical trials support services, or development services to pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and consumer health companies globally. We also compete in some cases with the internal operations of those pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and consumer health customers that also have manufacturing capabilities and choose to source these services internally.\nWe face substantial competition in each of our markets. Competition is driven by proprietary technologies and know-how, capabilities, consistency of operational performance, quality, price, value, responsiveness, and speed. Some competitors have greater financial, research and development, operational, and marketing resources than we do. Competition may also increase as additional companies enter our markets or use their existing resources to compete directly with ours. Expanded competition from companies in low-cost jurisdictions, such as India and China, may in the future adversely affect our results of operations or limit our growth. Greater financial, research and development, operational, and marketing resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly with strategic acquisitions, or with new, alternative, or emerging technologies. Changes in the nature or extent of our customers\u2019 requirements may render our offerings obsolete or non-competitive and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to product and other liability risks that could exceed our anticipated costs or adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows.\nWe are subject to potentially significant product liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the design, development, manufacture, and marketing of our offerings. We may be named as a defendant in product liability lawsuits, which may allege that our offerings have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury to consumers. Such lawsuits,\neven those without merit, could be costly to defend and could result in reduced sales, significant liabilities, adverse publicity, and diversion of management\u2019s time, attention, and resources.\nFurthermore, product liability claims and lawsuits, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition, and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers. The availability of product liability insurance for companies in the pharmaceutical industry is generally more limited than insurance available to companies in other industries. We maintain product liability insurance with annual aggregate limits in excess of $25 million. There can be no assurance that a successful product liability or other claim would be adequately covered by our applicable insurance policies or by any applicable contractual indemnity or liability limitations.\nFailure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements, including changing regulatory standards or changing interpretations of existing standards, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition or result in claims from customers. In addition, changes to our procedures or additional procedures, implemented to comply with public health orders or best practice guidelines as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, may increase our costs or reduce our productivity and thereby affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated. We, and our customers, are subject to various local, state, federal, national, and transnational laws and regulations, which include the operating, quality, and security standards of the FDA, the DEA, various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, the DHHS, similar bodies of the U.K., the E.U. and its member states, and other comparable agencies around the world, and, in the future, any change to such laws and regulations or the interpretation or application thereof could adversely affect us. Among other rules affecting us, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning cGMP and drug safety. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health activity, new public health orders or best practice guidelines may increase our costs to operate or reduce our productivity, thereby affecting our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nFailure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations or requests from regulatory authorities could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture or distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil or criminal sanctions, or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, permits, or registrations, including those relating to products or facilities. In addition, any such failure relating to the products or services we provide could expose us to contractual or product liability claims as well as claims from our customers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients, which cost could be significant.\nIn addition, any new offering or product classified as a pharmaceutical or medical device must undergo lengthy and rigorous clinical testing and other extensive, costly, and time-consuming procedures mandated by the FDA, the EMA, and other equivalent local, state, federal, national, and transnational regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions that regulate our offerings and products.\nAlthough we believe that we comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses, or other regulatory approvals or obtain, without significant delay, future permits, licenses, or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses. Any noncompliance by us or our customers with applicable law or regulation or the failure to maintain, renew, or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, loss of a permit, license, or other approval in any one portion of our business may have indirect consequences in another portion of our business if regulators or customers adjust their reviews of such other portion as a result or customers cease business with such other portion due to fears that such loss is a sign of broader concerns about our ability to deliver products or services of sufficient quality.\nFailure to provide quality offerings to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, and the market price of our Common Stock and may subject us to regulatory action or costly litigation.\nOur results depend on our ability to execute and improve when necessary our quality management strategy and systems, and effectively train and maintain our workforce with respect to quality management. Quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, and improving our offerings, and, despite our network of quality systems, a quality or safety issue, including with respect to a high-revenue product such as a COVID-19 vaccine or therapy, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, stock price, or results of operations and may subject us to regulatory action, including a product recall, product seizure, injunction to halt manufacture or distribution, or restriction on our operations; monetary fines; or other civil or criminal sanctions. In addition, such an issue could subject us to\nadverse publicity and costly litigation, including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients or other related losses, the cost of which could be significant.\nThe services and offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex, and, if we encounter problems providing the services or support required, our business could suffer.\nThe offerings we provide are highly exacting and complex, due in part to complex and exacting manufacturing processes and strict regulatory requirements. From time to time, problems may arise in connection with facility operations or during preparation or provision of an offering, in both cases for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, equipment malfunction, sterility variances or failures, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, environmental factors, and damage to, or loss of, manufacturing operations due to fire, flood, or similar causes. Such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches, require the destruction of or otherwise result in the loss of product or materials used in the production of product, or could halt facility production altogether. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, reimbursement to customers for lost active pharmaceutical ingredients or other related losses, time and expense spent investigating the cause, lost production time, and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other batches or products. Production problems in our biologic manufacturing operations could be particularly significant because the cost of raw materials is often appreciably higher than in our other businesses. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. In addition, such risks may be greater at facilities that are new or going through significant expansion or renovation. The risks associated with running a highly complex facility doing exacting work with substantial regulatory oversight are enhanced for our larger sites, like our Bloomington, Indiana, Harmans, Maryland, St. Petersburg, Florida, or Swindon U.K. sites, which generally generate much more revenue.\nIf we cannot keep pace with rapid technological advances, our services may become uncompetitive or obsolete, and our revenue and profitability may decline.\nThe healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Demand for our offerings may change in ways we may not anticipate because of evolving industry standards as well as a result of evolving customer needs that are increasingly sophisticated and varied and the introduction by others of new offerings and technologies that provide alternatives to our offerings. Several of our higher margin offerings are based on proprietary technologies. To the extent that such technologies are protected by patents, their related offerings may become subject to competition as the patents expire. Without the timely introduction of enhanced or new offerings and technologies, our offerings may become obsolete or uncompetitive over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. For example, if we are unable to respond to changes in the nature or extent of the technological or other needs of our pharmaceutical customers through enhancing our offerings, our competition may develop offerings that are more competitive than ours and we could find it more difficult to renew or expand existing agreements or obtain new agreements. Potential innovations intended to facilitate enhanced or new offerings generally will require a substantial investment before we can determine their commercial viability, and we may not obtain access to the innovations or have financial resources sufficient to fund all desired innovations.\nEven if we succeed in creating or acquiring enhanced or new offerings from these innovations, they may still fail to result in commercially successful offerings or may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development, and they may be rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of offerings embodying new technologies or features. Finally, innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice, the need for regulatory clearance, and uncertainty over market access or government or third-party reimbursement.\nWe and our customers depend on patents, copyrights, trademarks, know-how, trade secrets, and other forms of intellectual property protections, but these protections may not be adequate.\nWe rely on a combination of know-how, trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and technical measures to protect many of our offerings and intangible assets. These proprietary rights are important to our ongoing operations. There can be no assurance that these protections will provide uniqueness or meaningful competitive differentiation in our offerings or otherwise be commercially valuable or that we will be successful in obtaining additional intellectual property or enforcing our intellectual property rights against unauthorized users. Our exclusive rights under certain of our offerings are protected by patents, some of which will expire in the near term. When patents covering an offering expire, loss of exclusivity may occur, which may force us to compete with third parties, thereby negatively affecting our revenue and profitability.\nOur proprietary rights may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. We may in the future be subject to proceedings seeking to oppose or limit the scope of our patent applications or issued patents. In addition, in the future, we may need to take legal actions to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others. Legal proceedings are inherently uncertain, and the outcome of such proceedings may be unfavorable to us. Any legal action regardless of outcome might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.\nThere can be no assurance that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached, our trade secrets will not otherwise become known by competitors, or that we will have adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary information. Even if the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property is upheld, an adjudicator might construe our intellectual property not to cover the alleged infringement. In addition, intellectual property enforcement may be unavailable or practically ineffective in some countries. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology or that third parties will not design around our intellectual property claims to produce competitive offerings. The use of our technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, cause us to lose sales, or otherwise harm our business.\nWhile we continue to apply in the U.S. and certain other countries for registration of a number of trademarks, service marks, and patents, and also claim common law rights in various trademarks and service marks, there can be no assurance that third parties will not oppose our applications in the future. In addition, it is possible that in some cases we may be unable to obtain the registrations for trademarks, service marks, and patents for which we have applied, and a failure to obtain trademark and patent registrations in the U.S. or other countries could limit our ability to protect our trademarks and proprietary technologies and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions.\nLicense agreements with third parties control our rights to use certain patents, software, and information technology systems and proprietary technologies owned by third parties, some of which are important to our business. Termination of these license agreements for any reason could result in the loss of our rights to this intellectual property, causing an adverse change in our operations or the inability to commercialize certain offerings.\nIn addition, many of our branded pharmaceutical customers rely on patents to protect their products from generic competition. Because incentives exist in some countries, including the U.S., for generic pharmaceutical companies to challenge these patents, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are under the ongoing threat of challenges to their patents. If the patents on which our customers rely were successfully challenged and, as a result, the affected products become subject to generic competition, the market for our customers\u2019 products could be significantly adversely affected, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We attempt to mitigate these risks by making our offerings available to generic as well as branded manufacturers and distributors, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in marketing these offerings.\nOur offerings or our customers\u2019 products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nFrom time to time, third parties have asserted intellectual property infringement claims against us and our customers, and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against either us or our customers in the future. While we believe that our offerings do not infringe in any material respect upon proprietary rights of other parties, and that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertion to the contrary, there can be no assurance that we could successfully avoid being found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others. Patent applications in the United States and certain other countries are generally not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued or published, and we and our customers may not be aware of currently filed patent applications that relate to our or their products, offerings, or processes. If patents later issue on these applications, we or they may be found liable for subsequent infringement. There has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with respect to the manufacture, use, and sale of products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights.\nAny claim that our offerings or processes infringe third-party intellectual property rights (including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers), regardless of the claim\u2019s merit or resolution, could be costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. We may not prevail against any such claim given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property matters. If any such claim results in an adverse outcome, we could, among other things, be required to: pay substantial damages (potentially including treble damages in the U.S.); cease the manufacture, use, or sale of the infringing offerings or processes; discontinue the use of the infringing technology; expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology; license technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all; and lose the opportunity\nto license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property against others.\nIn addition, our customers\u2019 products may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement and such claims could materially affect our business if their products cease to be manufactured or they have to discontinue the use of the infringing technology.\nAny of the foregoing could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEvents that diminish, tarnish, or otherwise damage our brand may have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have built a strong brand in \u201cCatalent,\u201d with high overall and generally favorable awareness of the brand in our established markets and with target customers. Our brand identity is a competitive advantage for us in sales and marketing, which is evidenced by our customer mix among top branded drug, generics, biologics, and consumer health marketers. We have spent and continue to spend substantial time, money, and other resources to establish both our brand awareness and a favorable perception of our brand in relevant markets. Among other strategies, we participate in major international trade shows in our established markets and ensure visibility into our offerings through a comprehensive print and on-line advertising and publicity program. It is possible that a single event, or aggregation of several events, may diminish, tarnish, or otherwise damage our brand and adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations.\nFor example, meaningful interruptions to our ability to reliably supply one or more customers with products on time, whether as a result of supply chain disruptions or manufacturing delays or defects, may diminish our customers\u2019 confidence in our ability to timely meet our commitments, thereby damaging our brand. In addition, we are subject to various local, state, federal, national, and transnational laws and regulations, including the operating, quality, and security standards of the FDA, the DEA, and similar bodies of the U.K., the E.U., and other comparable agencies around the world. Highly public or significant negative reports or findings from a regulatory agency with respect to one or more manufacturing or quality defects in our operations, inspections of our facilities, or other routine reviews could cause negative public perception of our operations, negatively impacting our brand, and adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, many of the other risks we face, including those described elsewhere in \"Risk Factors\" could diminish, tarnish, or otherwise damage our brand.\nOur future results of operations are subject to fluctuations in the costs, availability, and suitability of the components of the products we manufacture, including active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients, purchased components, and raw materials. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing supply-chain disruptions triggered by a combination of the pandemic and the Ukrainian-Russian war may interfere with the operations of certain of our direct or indirect suppliers or with international trade for these supplies, which may either raise our costs or reduce the productivity or slow the timing of our operations.\nWe depend on various active pharmaceutical ingredients, components, compounds, raw materials, and energy supplied primarily by third parties for our offerings. Our customers also frequently provide to us their active pharmaceutical or biologic ingredient for formulation or incorporation in the finished product and may supply other raw materials as well. It is possible that any of our or our customers\u2019 supplier relationships could be interrupted due to changing regulatory requirements, import or export restrictions, natural disasters, international supply disruptions, including those caused by public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ongoing Ukrainian-Russian war, geopolitical issues, operational or quality issues at the suppliers\u2019 facilities, and other events, or could be terminated in the future.\nFor example, gelatin, a critical component for manufacturing many of our softgel formats is only available from a limited number of sources. In addition, much of the gelatin we use is bovine-derived. Past concerns of contamination from bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, have narrowed the number of possible sources of particular types of gelatin. If there were a future disruption in the supply of gelatin, we may not be able to obtain an adequate alternative supply. If future restrictions were to emerge on the use of bovine-derived gelatin, any such restriction could hinder our ability to timely supply our customers with products and the use of alternative material could be subject to lengthy and uncertain formulation, testing, and regulatory approval.\nIn addition, certain of our inputs are currently sole-sourced, so any disruption related to such a supplier is more likely to have an impact on our operations. Replacing a sole-source supplier of a production input to a medicine requiring marketing approval may be impossible or time-consuming, due to the rigorous standards we are obliged to apply to any new supplier.\nAny sustained interruption in our receipt of adequate supplies could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, while we have processes intended to reduce volatility in component and material pricing, we may not be able to successfully manage price fluctuations, and future price fluctuations or shortages may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChanges in market access or healthcare reimbursement for, or public sentiment towards our customers\u2019 products in the United States or internationally, or other changes in applicable policies regarding the healthcare industry, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition by affecting demand for our offerings.\nThe healthcare industry has changed significantly over time, and we expect the industry to continue to evolve. Some of these changes, such as ongoing healthcare reform, including with respect to reforming drug pricing, adverse changes in governmental or private funding of healthcare products and services, legislation or regulations governing patient access to care and privacy, or the delivery, pricing, or reimbursement approval of pharmaceuticals and healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare industry participants to change the amount of our offerings that they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for these offerings. In particular, it is possible that future legislation in the U.S. may affect or put a cap on future pricing of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products. While we are unable to predict the likelihood of changes to U.S. and other international laws affecting pharmaceutical and biotechnology products, any substantial revision of applicable healthcare legislation could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our customers\u2019 products, which in turn could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or business. Changes in the healthcare industry\u2019s pricing, selling, inventory, distribution, or supply policies or practices, or in public or government sentiment for the industry as a whole, could also significantly reduce our revenue and results of operations. In particular, volatility in individual product demand may result from changes in public or private payer reimbursement or coverage.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe generated net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) in the past that have been, and continue to be, used to reduce taxable income. Utilization of our NOL carryforwards may be subject to a substantial limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cInternal Revenue Code\u201d), and comparable provisions of state, local, and foreign tax laws due to changes in ownership of our company that may occur in the future. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and comparable provisions of state, local, and foreign tax laws, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change by value in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to carry forward its pre-change NOLs to reduce its post-change income may be limited. In addition, we acquired companies that generated pre-acquisition NOLs for tax purposes that will also be subject to limitation under Section 382 and comparable provisions of state, local, and foreign tax laws. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of future changes in our stock ownership. As a result, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to reduce U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign taxable income we produce in the future years may be subject to limitations, which could result in increased future tax liability to us.\nChanges to the estimated future profitability of the business may require that we establish an additional valuation allowance against all or some portion of our net deferred tax assets.\nWe have deferred tax assets for NOL carryforwards and other temporary differences. We currently maintain a valuation allowance for a portion of our U.S. net deferred tax assets and certain foreign net deferred tax assets. It is possible we may experience a decline in U.S. taxable income resulting from a decline in profitability of our U.S. operations, an increased level of debt in the U.S., or other factors. In assessing our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, we may conclude that it is more likely than not that some additional portion or all our deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result, we may be required to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, which could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and therefore our financial results.\nWe depend on key personnel.\nWe depend on our executive officers and other key personnel, including our technical personnel, to operate and grow our business and to develop new and enhanced offerings and technologies. The loss of any of these officers or other key personnel or a failure to attract and retain suitably skilled technical personnel could adversely affect our operations.\nIn addition to our executive officers, we rely on 190 senior employees to lead and direct our business. Our senior leadership team is comprised of our subsidiaries\u2019 executive officers and other vice presidents and directors who hold critical positions and possess specialized talents and capabilities that give us a competitive advantage in the market.\nWe employ more than 3,000 scientists and technicians whose areas of expertise and specialization cover subjects such as advanced delivery, biologics and gene and cell therapy formulation and manufacturing. Many of our sites and laboratories are located in competitive labor markets; therefore, global and regional competitors and, in some cases, customers and suppliers compete for the same skills and talent as we do.\nWe may acquire businesses and offerings that complement or expand our business or divest non-strategic businesses or assets. We may not be able to complete desired transactions, and such transactions, if executed, pose significant risks, including risks relating to our ability to successfully and efficiently integrate acquisitions or execute on dispositions and realize anticipated benefits therefrom. The failure to execute or realize the full benefits from any such transaction could have a negative effect on our operations and profitability.\nOur future success may depend in part on opportunities to buy or otherwise acquire rights to other businesses or technologies, enter into joint ventures or otherwise enter into strategic arrangements with business partners that could complement, enhance, or expand our current business or offerings and services or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities, or divest assets or an ongoing business. We face competition from other companies in pursuing acquisitions and similar transactions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. Our ability to complete transactions may also be limited by applicable antitrust and trade laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we or the operations or assets we seek to acquire carry on business. To the extent that we are successful in making acquisitions, we expend substantial amounts of cash, incur debt, or assume loss-making divisions as consideration. We or the purchaser of a divested asset or business may not be able to complete a desired transaction for any number of reasons, including a failure to secure financing.\nAny acquisition that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to, the diversion of management\u2019s attention to integrate the acquired businesses or joint ventures, the possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process, the potential loss of customers or employees in connection with the acquisition, delays or reduction in realizing expected synergies, unexpected liabilities, and our potential inability to achieve our intended objectives for the transaction. In addition, we may be unable to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures, and policies, which may lead to operational inefficiencies.\nTo the extent that we are not successful in completing desired divestitures, we may have to expend cash, incur debt, or continue to absorb the costs of loss-making or under-performing divisions. Any divestiture, whether we complete it or not, may involve numerous risks, including diversion of management\u2019s attention, a negative impact on our customer relationships, costs associated with maintaining its business during the disposition process, and the costs of closing and disposing of the affected business or transferring remaining portions of the operations of the business to other facilities.\nWe provide services incorporating various advanced modalities, including protein and plasmid production and cell and gene therapies, and these modalities relate to relatively new modes of treatment that may be subject to changing public opinion, continuing research, and increased regulatory scrutiny, each of which may affect our customers\u2019 abilities to conduct their businesses or obtain regulatory approvals for their therapies, and thereby adversely affect these offerings.\nCell and gene therapy, with or without the use of iPSCs or plasmids, remain relatively new means for treating disease and other medical conditions, with only a few cell and gene therapies approved to date in the U.S., the E.U., or elsewhere. Public perception may be influenced by claims that cell or gene therapies are unsafe, and cell or gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. In addition, ethical, social, legal, and cost-benefit concerns about cell or gene therapy, genetic testing, genetic research, and the use of stem cells or materials derived from viruses could result in additional regulations or limitations or even outright prohibitions on certain cell or gene therapies or related products. Various regulatory and legislative bodies have expressed an interest in, or have taken steps towards, further regulation of various biotechnologies, including cell and gene therapies. More restrictive regulations or claims that certain cell or gene therapies are unsafe or pose a hazard could reduce our customers\u2019 use of our services. We can provide no assurance whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies, or guidance changed, or interpretations of existing strictures by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nWe are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, which could increase our costs or restrict our operations in the future.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those of the EPA, OSHA, and equivalent local, state, and national regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any failure by us to comply with environmental, health, and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of production or subject us to monetary fines, civil or criminal sanctions, or other future liabilities in excess of our reserves. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations governing the destruction and disposal of raw materials, byproducts of our manufacturing\noperations, and non-compliant products, the handling of regulated material included in our offerings, and the disposal of our products or their components at the end of their useful lives. In addition, compliance with environmental, health, and safety requirements could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly environmental or safety control equipment, incur other significant expenses, or modify our manufacturing processes. Our manufacturing facilities may use, in varying degrees, hazardous substances in their processes. These substances include, among others, chlorinated solvents, and in the past chlorinated solvents were used at one or more of our facilities, including a number we no longer own or operate. As at our current facilities, contamination at such formerly owned or operated properties can result and has resulted in liability to us. In the event of the discovery of new or previously unknown contamination either at our facilities, facilities we acquire in the future, or at third-party locations, including facilities we formerly owned or operated, the issuance of additional requirements with respect to existing contamination, or the imposition of other cleanup obligations for which we are responsible, we may be required to take additional, unplanned remedial measures for which we have not recorded reserves. We are conducting monitoring and cleanup of contamination at certain facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us, and such activities may result in unanticipated costs or management distraction.\nWe are subject to labor and employment laws and regulations, which could increase our costs and restrict our operations in the future.\nWe have nearly 19,000 individuals providing services for us worldwide, including approximately 11,700 service providers in North America, 5,700 in Europe, 1,000 in South America, and 600 in the Asia-Pacific region. Certain employees at one of our North American facilities are represented by a labor organization, and national works councils or labor organizations are active at our European facilities and certain of our other facilities consistent with local labor environments and laws. Our management believes that our employee relations are satisfactory. However, further organizing activities, collective bargaining, or changes in the regulatory framework for employment may increase our employment-related costs or may result in work stoppages or other labor disruptions. Moreover, as employers are subject to various employment-related claims, such as individual and class actions relating to alleged employment discrimination and wage-hour and labor standards issues, such actions, if brought against us and successful in whole or in part, may affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCertain of our pension plans are underfunded, and additional cash contributions we may make to increase the funding level will reduce the cash available for our business, such as the payment of our interest expense.\nCertain of our current and former employees in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, France, Japan, Belgium, and Switzerland are participants in defined benefit pension plans that we sponsor. As of June 30, 2022, the underfunded amount of our pension plans on a worldwide basis was $28 million, primarily related to our pension plans in the U.K. and Germany. In addition, we have an estimated obligation of $38 million, as of June 30, 2022, related to our withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan in which we formerly participated. In general, the amount of future contributions to the underfunded plans will depend upon asset returns, applicable actuarial assumptions, prevailing and expected interest rates, and other factors, and, as a result, the amount we may be required to contribute in the future to fund the obligations associated with such plans may vary. Such cash contributions to the plans will reduce the cash available for our business, including the funds available to pursue strategic growth initiatives or the payment of interest expense on our indebtedness.\nOur global operations are subject to economic and political risks, that could affect the profitability of our operations or require costly changes to our procedures.\nWe conduct our operations in various regions of the world, including North America, South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. Global and regional economic and political developments affect businesses such as ours in many ways. Our operations are subject to the effects of global and regional competition. Our global operations are also affected by local economic environments, including inflation and recession. Political changes, some of which may be disruptive, and related hostilities can interfere with our supply chain, our customers, and some or all of our activities in a particular location. While some of these risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments and some are insurable, such mitigating measures may be unavailable, costly, or unsuccessful.\nBeginning in fiscal 2022, much of the world, including the U.S. and the E.U., began to experience inflation levels not seen in more than 30 years. As a result, prices for many of our inputs have risen, in some cases dramatically. If inflation stays at elevated levels or increases, we may not be able to mitigate the impact of the increased costs we will bear through corresponding price increases to our customers, which could have an impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a global enterprise, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the U.S. dollar, our reporting currency, against other currencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations.\nAs a company with significant operations outside of the U.S., certain revenues, costs, assets, and liabilities, including our euro-denominated 2.375% Senior Notes due 2028 (the \u201c2028 Notes\u201d), are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which is the currency that we use to report our financial results. As a result, changes in the exchange rates of these or any other applicable currency to the U.S. dollar will affect our revenues, earnings, and cash flows. There has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates affecting the various currencies in which we do business. Such volatility and other changes in exchange rates could result in unrealized and realized exchange losses, despite any effort we may undertake to manage or mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the values of various currencies.\nTax legislative or regulatory initiatives, new interpretations or developments concerning existing tax laws, or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are a large multinational enterprise with operations in the U.S. and more than a dozen other countries across North and South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region, and we do business with suppliers and customers in many additional regions. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state, and local governments and of many jurisdictions outside of the U.S. From time to time, various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions, and existing legislation may be subject to additional regulatory changes or new interpretations. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives.\nIn addition, U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. We are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by various tax authorities. Examinations or changes in laws, rules, regulations, or interpretations by taxing authorities could result in adverse impacts to tax years open under statute or to our operating structures currently in place. It is possible that the outcomes from these examinations or changes in laws, rules, regulations, or interpretations by taxing authorities will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe use advanced information and communication systems to run our operations, compile and analyze financial and operational data, and communicate among our employees, customers, and counter-parties, and the risks generally associated with information and communications systems could adversely affect our results of operations. We continuously work to install new, and upgrade existing, systems and provide employee awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber security risks to enhance the protections available to us, but such protections may be inadequate to address malicious attacks or inadvertent compromises affecting data security or the operability of such systems.\nWe rely on information systems in our business to obtain, process, analyze, and manage data to:\n\u2022facilitate the manufacture and distribution of thousands of inventory items in, to, and from our facilities;\n\u2022receive, process, and ship orders on a timely basis;\n\u2022manage the accurate billing and collections for more than one thousand customers;\n\u2022create, compile, and retain testing and other product-, manufacturing-, or facility-related data necessary for meeting our and our customers\u2019 regulatory obligations.\n\u2022manage the accurate accounting and payment for thousands of vendors and our employees;\n\u2022schedule and operate our global network of development, manufacturing, and packaging facilities;\n\u2022document various aspects of our activities, including the agreements we make with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022compile financial and other operational data into reports necessary to manage our business and comply with various regulatory or contractual obligations, including obligations under our bank loans and other indebtedness, the federal securities laws, the Internal Revenue Code, and other applicable state, local, and ex-U.S. tax laws; and communicate among our nearly 19,000 workers spread across dozens of facilities over four continents.\nWe face various security threats on a regular basis, including ongoing cyber security threats to and attacks on our information technology infrastructure. We deploy defenses against such threats and attacks and work to secure the integrity of our data systems using techniques, hardware, and software typical of companies of our size and scope. Despite our security measures, however, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by increasingly sophisticated intruders or others who try to cause harm to or interfere with our normal use of our systems. They are also susceptible to breach due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. Our suppliers, contractors, service providers, and other third parties with whom we do business also experience cyber threats and attacks that are similar in frequency and sophistication. In many cases, we have to rely on the controls and safeguards put in place by our suppliers, contractors, service providers, and other third parties to defend against, respond to, and report these attacks. We cannot know the potential impact of future cyber incidents, which vary widely in severity and scale. There can be no assurance that the various procedures and controls we\nutilize to mitigate these threats will be sufficient to prevent disruptions to our systems, in part because (i) cyber-attack techniques change frequently and, at times, new techniques are not recognized until launched, and (ii) cyber-attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted or damaged or fail for any extended period.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nThe size of our indebtedness and the obligations associated with it could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or in our industry or to deploy capital to grow our business, expose us to interest-rate risk to the extent of our variable-rate debt, or prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness. These risks may be increased in a recessionary environment, particularly as sources of capital may become less available or more expensive.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we had $4.20 billion (U.S. dollar equivalent) of total indebtedness outstanding, consisting of $1.43 billion of secured indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities and $2.77 billion of senior unsecured indebtedness, including $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% U.S. dollar-denominated Senior Notes due 2027 (the \u201c2027 Notes\u201d), \u20ac825 million aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes, $550 million aggregate principal amount of U.S. dollar-denominated 3.125% Senior Notes due 2029 (the \u201c2029 Notes\u201d), and $650 million aggregate principal amount of U.S. dollar-denominated 3.500% Senior Notes due 2030 (the \u201c2030 Notes\u201d and, together with the 2027 Notes, the 2028 Notes, and the 2029 Notes, the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d). As of June 30, 2022, we also held $234 million in finance lease obligations. In addition, we had $721 million of unutilized capacity under our $725 million secured revolving credit commitments due to $4 million of outstanding letters of credit, which is part of our senior secured credit facilities (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d).\nThe multi-billion-dollar size of our indebtedness could have important consequences for us, including:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry, or competitive developments;\n\u2022exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022exposing us to the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates because of our euro-denominated notes;\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in one or more events of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness or, through cross-defaults, in agreements governing other indebtedness;\n\u2022restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or capital investments or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less indebtedness relative to their size and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our higher level of indebtedness prevents us from exploiting.\nOur total interest expense, net was $123 million, $110 million, and $126 million for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. After taking into consideration our ratio of fixed-to-floating-rate debt, including as a result of our February 2021 interest-rate swap agreement with Bank of America N.A., and assuming that our Revolving Credit Facility is undrawn and LIBOR is above any applicable minimum floor, each change of 100 basis points in interest rates would result in a change of approximately $9 million in annual interest expense on the indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities.\nOur interest expense may continue to increase as policymakers combat the inflation that has taken hold since fiscal 2022 through interest-rate increases on benchmark financial products that can affect the interest rates on our variable-rate debt.\nDespite our high indebtedness level, we and our subsidiaries are still capable of incurring significant additional debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that we may incur while remaining in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, as of June 30, 2022, we had approximately $721 million available to us for borrowing, subject to certain conditions, under our Revolving Credit Facility. If new debt is added to our subsidiaries\u2019 existing debt levels, the risks associated with debt we currently face would increase.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit the ability of Operating Company and those of its subsidiaries to which these covenants apply (which Operating Company\u2019s Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of May 20, 2014 (as amended, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) calls \u201crestricted subsidiaries\u201d) to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;\n\u2022pay certain dividends on, repurchase, or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022pay distributions from restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022issue or sell capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022guarantee certain indebtedness;\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022sell or exchange certain assets;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022create certain liens; and\n\u2022consolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements, including as a result of cross-default provisions, and, in the case of our Revolving Credit Facility, permit the lenders to cease making loans to us.\nDespite the limitations in our debt agreements, we retain the ability to take certain actions that may interfere with our ability to timely pay our substantial indebtedness.\nThe covenants in the Credit Agreement and in the several indentures governing our Senior Notes (collectively, the \"Indentures\") contain various exceptions to the limitations they otherwise impose on our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to take the various actions described in the prior risk factor. For example, if the Senior Notes have investment-grade ratings and we are not in default under these agreements, certain of these covenants will not apply, including the covenants restricting certain dividends and other payments, the covenants concerning the incurrence of indebtedness, and the covenants limiting guarantees of indebtedness by our restricted subsidiaries. In addition, the covenants restricting dividends and other distributions by us, purchases or redemption of certain equity securities, and prepayment, redemption, or repurchase of any subordinated indebtedness are subject to various exceptions.\nWe are currently using and may in the future use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variable-rate indebtedness or changes in currency exchange rates, and any such instrument may expose us to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or non-performance of these instruments.\nWe have executed and may enter into additional or new interest-rate swap agreements, currency swap agreements, or other hedging transactions in an attempt to limit our exposure to adverse changes in variable interest rates and currency exchange rates. Such instruments may result in economic losses if, for example, prevailing interest rates decline to a point lower than any applicable fixed-rate commitment. Any such swap will expose us to credit-related risks that, if realized, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has historically been and may continue to be volatile, and a holder of shares of our Common Stock may not be able to resell such shares at or above the price such stockholder paid, or at all, and could lose all or part of such investment as a result.\nThe trading price of our Common Stock has been and continues to be volatile. For the three years ended June 30, 2022, our Common Stock price as quoted on the NYSE ranged from $36.95 to $142.35. The trading price of our Common Stock may be adversely affected by any one or more of several factors, such as those listed above in \u201c-Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry in Which We Operate\u201d and the following:\n\u2022results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022results of operations that vary from those of our competitors;\n\u2022changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022declines in the market prices of stocks generally, or those of pharmaceutical or other healthcare companies;\n\u2022strategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new products, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures, other strategic relationships, or capital commitments;\n\u2022changes in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or markets, such as increased inflation;\n\u2022changes in business or regulatory conditions or regulatory actions taken with respect to our business or the business of any of our competitors or customers;\n\u2022future sales of our Common Stock or other securities we may issue in the future;\n\u2022investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our Common Stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\u2022any decision by securities analysts to not publish research or reports about our business or to downgrade our stock or our sector;\n\u2022the public response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with or information furnished to the SEC;\n\u2022announcements relating to or developments in litigation;\n\u2022guidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any change in this guidance, or any failure to meet this guidance;\n\u2022the availability of an active trading market for our Common Stock;\n\u2022public response to changes in the COVID-19 pandemic and public perceptions as to the need for manufacture of certain COVID-19-related products and our role in the successful manufacture of such products;\n\u2022changes in the accounting principles we use to record our results or our application of these principles to our business; and\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from natural disasters, hostilities, acts of terrorism, geopolitical activity, public health crises, including pandemics, or responses to these events.\nBroad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float or trading volume of our Common Stock is low, and the amount of public float on any given day can vary depending on the individual actions of our stockholders.\nFollowing periods of market volatility, stockholders have been known to institute securities class action litigation in order to recover their resulting losses. If we become involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of senior management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nBecause we have no plan to pay cash dividends on our Common Stock for the foreseeable future, receiving a return on an investment in our Common Stock may require a sale for a net price greater than what was paid for it.\nWe currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion, and debt repayment and have no current plan to pay any cash dividend on our Common Stock for the foreseeable future. Any future decision to pay a dividend in respect of our Common Stock, and the amount and timing of any such dividend, will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors may take into account, when deciding whether or how to pay a dividend, such factors as they may deem relevant, including general economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, possible future alternative deployments of our cash, our future capital requirements, and contractual, legal, tax, and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our holders of shares of our Common Stock or by our subsidiaries to us. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by covenants in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness and may be limited by covenants of any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. As a result, a holder of a share of our Common Stock may not receive any return on such investment unless it is sold for a price greater than that which was paid for it, taking into account any applicable commission or other costs of acquisition or sale.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, of our Common Stock, by us or our existing stockholders could cause the market price for our Common Stock to decline.\nThe sale of shares of our Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our Common Stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nThe market price of shares of our Common Stock could drop significantly if the holders of our Common Stock sell their shares or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of shares of our equity securities that we wish to issue. In the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The number of shares of our Common Stock issued or issuable in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of then-outstanding shares of our\nCommon Stock, subject to limitations on issuance of new shares without stockholder approval imposed by the NYSE or to restrictions set forth in the agreements governing our indebtedness, or the Stockholders\u2019 Agreement between the Company and holders of our formerly outstanding Series A convertible preferred stock, par value $0.01 (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d). Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments, acquisitions, or otherwise may result in dilution to the holders of shares of our Common Stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.\nCertain provisions of our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer, or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt, or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders, including transactions that might otherwise result in the payment of a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders.\nThese provisions provide for, among other things:\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock;\n\u2022advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings (though our board of directors has implemented shareholder proxy access); and\n\u2022certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings.\nProvisions such as those just described, to the extent that they remain in effect, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third-party\u2019s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.", "PERMNO": 14763, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "CTLT"}
