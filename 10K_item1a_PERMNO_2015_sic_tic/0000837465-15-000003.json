{"cik": "837465", "company": "CALLAWAY GOLF CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCertain Factors Affecting Callaway Golf Company\nThe Company\u2019s business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The Company urges you to carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those risks set forth under the heading entitled \u201cImportant Notice to Investors Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and in other documents that the Company files with the Commission, before making any investment decision with respect to the Company\u2019s securities. If any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be adversely affected. Under these circumstances, the trading prices of the Company\u2019s securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in the Company\u2019s securities.\nUnfavorable economic conditions could have a negative impact on consumer discretionary spending and therefore negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company sells golf clubs, golf balls and golf accessories. These products are recreational in nature and are therefore discretionary purchases for consumers. Consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases of golf products during favorable economic conditions and when consumers are feeling confident and prosperous. Discretionary spending is also affected by many other factors, including general business conditions, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxes and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. Purchases of the Company\u2019s products could decline during periods when disposable income is lower, or during periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions. A significant or prolonged\ndecline in general economic conditions or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that adversely affect consumer discretionary spending, whether in the United States or in the Company\u2019s international markets, could result in reduced sales of the Company\u2019s products, which could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nA severe or prolonged economic downturn could adversely affect the Company's customers\u2019 financial condition, their levels of business activity and their ability to pay trade obligations.\nThe Company primarily sells its products to golf equipment retailers directly and through wholly-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries, and to foreign distributors. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers\u2019 financial condition and generally requires no collateral from these customers. However, a severe or prolonged downturn in the general economy could adversely affect the retail golf equipment market which in turn, would negatively impact the liquidity and cash flows of the Company's customers, including the ability of such customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the Company's products and to pay their trade obligations. This could result in increased delinquent or uncollectible accounts for some of the Company\u2019s significant customers. A failure by the Company\u2019s customers to pay on a timely basis a significant portion of outstanding account receivable balances would adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company has significant international sales and purchases, and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s purchases and sales is international, and the Company conducts transactions in various currencies worldwide. Conducting business in such currencies exposes the Company to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars. As a result, transactions conducted in foreign currencies must be translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes based upon the applicable foreign currency exchange rates. Fluctuations in these foreign currency exchange rates therefore may positively or negatively affect the Company\u2019s reported financial results and can significantly affect period-over-period comparisons.\nThe effect of the translation of foreign currencies on the Company\u2019s financial results can be significant. The Company therefore engages in certain hedging activities to mitigate over time the impact of the translation of foreign currencies on the Company\u2019s financial results. The Company\u2019s hedging activities can reduce, but will not eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. The extent to which the Company\u2019s hedging activities mitigate the effects of foreign currency translation varies based upon many factors, including the amount of transactions being hedged. Other factors that could affect the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts, volatility of currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments. Since the hedging activities are designed to reduce volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. dollar but also reduce the positive impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. The Company\u2019s future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which the Company conducts business.\nForeign currency fluctuations can also affect the prices at which products are sold in the Company\u2019s international markets. The Company therefore adjusts its pricing based in part upon fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Significant unanticipated changes in foreign currency exchange rates make it more difficult for the Company to manage pricing in its international markets. If the Company is unable to adjust its pricing in a timely manner to counteract the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, the Company\u2019s pricing may not be competitive in the marketplace and the Company\u2019s financial results in its international markets could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s obligations and certain financial covenants contained under its existing credit facility expose it to risks that could materially and adversely affect its liquidity, business, operating results, financial condition and ability to make any dividend or other payments on its capital stock.\nThe Company\u2019s primary credit facility is a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (as amended, the \u201cABL Facility\u201d), comprised of a U.S. facility, a Canadian facility and a United Kingdom facility, in each case subject to borrowing base availability under the applicable facility. The amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are secured by certain assets, including cash (to the extent pledged by the Company), inventory and accounts receivable, of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. The maximum availability under the ABL Facility fluctuates with the general seasonality of the business, and increases and decreases with the changes in the Company's inventory and account receivable balances.\nThe ABL Facility includes certain restrictions including, among other things, restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, liens, dividends, stock repurchases and other restricted payments, asset sales, investments, mergers, acquisitions and affiliate transactions. Additionally, the Company is subject to compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant during, and continuing 30 days after, any period in which the Company\u2019s borrowing base availability falls below $23.0 million. If the Company experiences a decline in revenues or adjusted EBITDA, the Company may have difficulty paying interest and principal amounts due on its ABL Facility or other indebtedness and meeting certain of the financial covenants contained in the ABL Facility. If the Company is unable to make required payments under the ABL Facility, or if the Company fails to comply with the various covenants and other requirements of the ABL Facility or other indebtedness, the Company would be in default thereunder, which would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate the maturity thereof. Any default under the ABL Facility or other indebtedness could have a significant adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, business, operating results and financial condition and ability to make any dividend or other payments on the Company\u2019s capital stock. See Note 4 \u201cFinancing Arrangements,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the terms of the ABL Facility.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to generate sufficient positive cash flows from operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties, including future economic trends and conditions, the success of the Company\u2019s multi-year turnaround, demand for the Company\u2019s products, foreign currency exchange rates and other risks and uncertainties applicable to the Company and its business. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to generate sufficient operating cash flows in the future or maintain or grow its existing cash balances. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flows to fund its business due to a further decline in sales or otherwise and is unable to reduce its manufacturing costs and operating expenses to offset such decline, the Company will need to increase its reliance on the ABL Facility for needed liquidity. If the ABL Facility is not then available or sufficient and the Company is not able to secure alternative financing arrangements, the Company\u2019s future operations would be materially, adversely affected.\nUnauthorized access to, or accidental disclosure of, consumer personally-identifiable information including credit card information, that the Company collects through its websites may result in significant expenses and negatively impact the Company's reputation and business.\nThere is growing concern over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy. While the Company has implemented security measures, the Company\u2019s computer systems may be susceptible to electronic or physical computer break-ins, viruses and other disruptions and security breaches. Any perceived or actual unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure of personally-identifiable information regarding visitors to the Company\u2019s websites or otherwise, whether through a breach of the Company\u2019s network by an unauthorized party, employee theft, misuse or error or otherwise, could harm the Company\u2019s reputation, impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract website visitors, or subject the Company to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by consumers, and adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations, financial performance and condition.\nIf the Company is unable to successfully manage the frequent introduction of new products that satisfy changing consumer preferences, it could significantly and adversely impact its financial performance and prospects for future growth.\nThe Company\u2019s main products, like those of its competitors, generally have life cycles of two years or less, with sales occurring at a much higher rate in the first year than in the second. Factors driving these short product life cycles include the rapid introduction of competitive products and consumer demands for the latest technology. In this marketplace, a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s annual revenues is generated each year by products that are in their first year of their product life cycle.\nThese marketplace conditions raise a number of issues that the Company must successfully manage. For example, the Company must properly anticipate consumer preferences and design products that meet those preferences while also complying with significant restrictions imposed by the Rules of Golf (see further discussion of the Rules of Golf below) or its new products will not achieve sufficient market success to compensate for the usual decline in sales experienced by products already in the market. Second, the Company\u2019s research and development and supply chain groups face constant pressures to design, develop, source and supply new products that perform better than their predecessors-many of which incorporate new or otherwise untested technology, suppliers or inputs. Third, for new products to generate equivalent or greater revenues than their predecessors, they must either maintain the same or higher sales levels with the same or higher pricing, or exceed the performance of their predecessors in one or both of those areas. Fourth, the relatively short window of opportunity for launching and selling new products requires great precision in forecasting demand and assuring that supplies are ready and delivered during the critical selling periods. Finally, the rapid changeover in products creates a need to monitor and manage the closeout of older products both at retail and in the\nCompany\u2019s own inventory. Should the Company not successfully manage the frequent introduction of new products that satisfy consumer demand, the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be significantly adversely affected.\nA reduction in the number of rounds of golf played or in the number of golf participants could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales.\nThe Company generates substantially all of its revenues from the sale of golf-related products, including golf clubs, golf balls and golf accessories. The demand for golf-related products in general, and golf balls in particular, is directly related to the number of golf participants and the number of rounds of golf being played by these participants, both of which have declined in recent years. If golf participation or the number of rounds of golf played continues to decrease, sales of the Company\u2019s products may be adversely affected. In the future, the overall dollar volume of the market for golf-related products may not grow or may decline.\nIn addition, the demand for golf products is also directly related to the popularity of magazines, cable channels and other media dedicated to golf, television coverage of golf tournaments and attendance at golf events. The Company depends on the exposure of its products through advertising and the media or at golf tournaments and events. Any significant reduction in television coverage of, or attendance at, golf tournaments and events or any significant reduction in the popularity of golf magazines or golf television channels, could reduce the visibility of the Company\u2019s brand and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales.\nThe Company may have limited opportunities for future growth in sales of golf clubs and golf balls.\nIn order for the Company to significantly grow its sales of golf clubs or golf balls, the Company must either increase its share of the market for golf clubs or golf balls, or the market for golf clubs or golf balls must grow. The Company already has a significant share of worldwide sales of golf clubs and golf balls and the golf industry is very competitive. As such, gaining incremental market share quickly or at all is difficult. Therefore, opportunities for additional market share may be limited given the challenging competitive nature of the golf industry. The Company also believes that the worldwide golf market has not grown significantly in recent years. In the future, the overall dollar volume of worldwide sales of golf clubs or golf balls may not grow or may decline.\nIf the Company inaccurately forecasts demand for its products, it may manufacture either insufficient or excess quantities, which, in either case, could adversely affect its financial performance.\nThe Company plans its manufacturing capacity based upon the forecasted demand for its products. Forecasting the demand for the Company's products is very difficult given the amount of specification involved. For example, the Company must forecast not only how many drivers it will sell, but also (1) the quantity of each driver model, (2) the quantity of the different lofts in each driver model, and (3) for each driver model and loft, the number of left handed and right handed versions. The nature of the Company\u2019s business makes it difficult to adjust quickly its manufacturing capacity if actual demand for its products exceeds or is less than forecasted demand. If actual demand for its products exceeds the forecasted demand, the Company may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of new products in time to fulfill actual demand, which could limit the Company\u2019s sales and adversely affect its financial performance. On the other hand, if actual demand is less than the forecasted demand for its products, the Company could produce excess quantities, resulting in excess inventories and related obsolescence charges that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe Company depends on single source or a limited number of suppliers for some of its products, and the loss of any of these suppliers could harm its business.\nThe Company is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for its clubheads and shafts, some of which are single sourced. Furthermore, some of the Company\u2019s products require specially developed manufacturing techniques and processes which make it difficult to identify and utilize alternative suppliers quickly. In addition, many of the Company\u2019s suppliers are not well capitalized and prolonged unfavorable economic conditions could increase the risk that they will go out of business. If current suppliers are unable to deliver clubheads, shafts or other components, or if the Company is required to transition to other suppliers, the Company could experience significant production delays or disruption to its business. The Company also depends on a single or a limited number of suppliers for the materials it uses to make its golf balls. Many of these materials are customized for the Company. Any delay or interruption in such supplies could have a material adverse impact upon the Company\u2019s golf ball business. If the Company were able to experience any such delays or interruptions, the Company may not be able to find adequate alternative suppliers at a reasonable cost or without significant disruption to its business.\nA significant disruption in the operations of the Company\u2019s golf club assembly and golf ball manufacturing and assembly facilities could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s sales, profitability and results of operations.\nA significant disruption at any of the Company\u2019s golf club or golf ball manufacturing facilities or distribution centers in the United States and in regions outside the United States could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales, profitability and results of operations.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d require the Company to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing the Company\u2019s products.\nIn August 2012, the Commission adopted rules requiring disclosure related to sourcing of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. The rules require companies to, under specified circumstances, undertake due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. The Company\u2019s products may contain some of the specified minerals. As a result, the Company will incur additional expenses in connection with complying with the rules, including with respect to any due diligence that is required under the rules. In addition, the implementation of the rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company\u2019s products. There may only be a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d conflict minerals, and the Company cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain necessary \u201cconflict free\u201d conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Because the Company\u2019s supply chain is complex, the Company may also not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in the Company\u2019s products through the due diligence procedures that the Company implements, which may harm the Company\u2019s reputation.\nA disruption in the service or a significant increase in the cost of the Company\u2019s primary delivery and shipping services for its products and component parts or a significant disruption at shipping ports could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company uses United Parcel Service (\u201cUPS\u201d) for substantially all ground shipments of products to its U.S. customers. The Company uses air carriers and ocean shipping services for most of its international shipments of products. Furthermore, many of the components the Company uses to build its golf clubs, including clubheads and shafts, are shipped to the Company via air carrier and ship services. If there is any significant interruption in service by such providers or at airports or shipping ports, the Company may be unable to engage alternative suppliers or to receive or ship goods through alternate sites in order to deliver its products or components in a timely and cost-efficient manner. As a result, the Company could experience manufacturing delays, increased manufacturing and shipping costs and lost sales as a result of missed delivery deadlines and product demand cycles. Any significant interruption in UPS services, air carrier services, ship services or at shipping ports could have a material adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s business. Furthermore, if the cost of delivery or shipping services were to increase significantly and the additional costs could not be covered by product pricing, the Company\u2019s operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company faces intense competition in each of its markets and if it is unable to maintain a competitive advantage, loss of market share, revenue, or profitability may result.\nGolf Clubs. The golf club business is highly competitive, and is served by a number of well-established and well-financed companies with recognized brand names. New product introductions, price reductions, consignment sales, extended payment terms, \u201ccloseouts,\u201d including closeouts of products that were recently commercially successful, and significant tour and advertising spending by competitors continue to generate intense market competition. Furthermore, continued downward pressure on pricing in the market for new clubs could have a significant adverse effect on the Company\u2019s pre-owned club business as the gap narrows between the cost of a new club and a pre-owned club. Successful marketing activities, discounted pricing, consignment sales, extended payment terms or new product introductions by competitors could negatively impact the Company\u2019s future sales.\nGolf Balls. The golf ball business is also highly competitive. There are a number of well-established and well-financed competitors, including one competitor with an estimated U.S. market share of over 50%. The Company\u2019s competitors continue to incur significant costs in the areas of advertising, tour and other promotional support. The Company believes that to be competitive, the Company also needs to continue to incur significant expenses in tour, advertising and promotional support. Unless there is a change in competitive conditions, these competitive pressures and increased costs will continue to adversely affect the profitability of the Company\u2019s golf ball business.\nAccessories. The Company\u2019s accessories include golf bags, golf gloves, golf footwear, golf apparel and other items. The Company faces significant competition in every region with respect to each of these product categories. In most cases, the Company is not the market leader with respect to its accessory markets.\nThe Company\u2019s golf club and golf ball business has a concentrated customer base. The loss of one or more of the Company\u2019s top customers could have a significant effect on the Company\u2019s golf club and golf ball sales.\nOn a consolidated basis, no one customer that distributes golf clubs or golf balls in the United States accounted for more than 8% of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenues in 2014, 2013 and 2012. The Company's top five customers accounted for more than 25% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2014, and 23% in 2013 and 25% in 2012. On a segment basis, in 2014, the Company's top five golf club and golf ball customers accounted for approximately 25% and 30% of the Company\u2019s total consolidated golf club and golf ball sales, respectively. A loss of one or more of these customers could have a significant adverse effect on the Company\u2019s golf club and golf ball sales.\nInternational political instability and terrorist activities may decrease demand for the Company\u2019s products and disrupt its business.\nTerrorist activities and armed conflicts could have an adverse effect upon the United States or worldwide economy and could cause decreased demand for the Company\u2019s products as consumers\u2019 attention and interests are diverted from golf and become focused on issues relating to these events. If such events disrupt domestic or international air, ground or sea shipments, or the operation of the Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities, the Company\u2019s ability to obtain the materials necessary to manufacture its products and to deliver customer orders would be harmed, which would have a significant adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Such events can negatively impact tourism, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales to retailers at resorts and other vacation destinations. In addition, the occurrence of political instability and/or terrorist activities generally restricts travel to and from the affected areas, making it more difficult in general to manage the company\u2019s international operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be harmed by the occurrence of natural disasters or pandemic diseases.\nThe occurrence of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, tsunami, fire, flood or hurricane, or the outbreak of a pandemic disease, could significantly adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. A natural disaster or a pandemic disease could significantly adversely affect both the demand for the Company\u2019s products as well as the supply of the components used to make the Company\u2019s products. Demand for golf products also could be negatively affected as consumers in the affected regions restrict their recreational activities and as tourism to those areas declines. If the Company\u2019s suppliers experienced a significant disruption in their business as a result of a natural disaster or pandemic disease, the Company\u2019s ability to obtain the necessary components to make its products could be significantly adversely affected. In addition, the occurrence of a natural disaster or the outbreak of a pandemic disease generally restricts travel to and from the affected areas, making it more difficult in general to manage the Company\u2019s international operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business and operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could result in fluctuations in its operating results and stock price.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. The Company\u2019s first quarter-sales generally represent the Company\u2019s sell-in to the golf retail channel of its golf club products for the new golf season. The Company\u2019s second and third-quarter sales generally represent reorder business for golf clubs. Sales of golf clubs during the second and third quarters are significantly affected not only by the sell-through of the Company\u2019s products that were sold into the channel during the first quarter but also by the sell-through of products by the Company\u2019s competitors. Retailers are sometimes reluctant to reorder the Company\u2019s products in significant quantities when they already have excess inventory of products of the Company or its competitors. The Company\u2019s sales of golf balls are generally associated with the level of rounds played in the areas where the Company\u2019s products are sold. Therefore, golf ball sales tend to be greater in the second and third quarters, when the weather is good in most of the Company\u2019s key markets and the number of rounds played are up. Golf ball sales are also stimulated by product introductions as the retail channel takes on initial supplies. Like those of golf clubs, reorders of golf balls depend on the rate of sell-through. The Company\u2019s sales during the fourth quarter are generally significantly less than those of the other quarters because in many of the Company\u2019s key regions fewer people are playing golf during that time of year due to cold weather. Furthermore, the Company generally announces its new product line in the fourth quarter to allow retailers to plan for the new golf season. Such early announcements of new products could cause golfers, and therefore the Company\u2019s customers, to defer purchasing additional golf\nequipment until the Company\u2019s new products are available. Such deferments could have a material adverse effect upon sales of the Company\u2019s current products or result in closeout sales at reduced prices.\nThe seasonality of the Company\u2019s business could be exacerbated by the adverse effects of unusual or severe weather conditions as well as by severe weather conditions caused by climate change on the Company\u2019s business.\nDue to the seasonality of the Company\u2019s business, the Company\u2019s business can be significantly adversely affected by unusual or severe weather conditions and by severe weather conditions caused by climate change. Unfavorable weather conditions generally result in fewer golf rounds played, which generally results in reduced demand for all golf products, and in particular, golf balls. Furthermore, catastrophic storms can negatively affect golf rounds played both during the storms and afterward, as storm damaged golf courses are repaired and golfers focus on repairing the damage to their homes, businesses and communities. Consequently, sustained adverse weather conditions, especially during the warm weather months, could materially affect the Company\u2019s sales.\nGoodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of the Company\u2019s total assets and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact the Company's results of operations and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nThe Company\u2019s goodwill and intangible assets consist of goodwill from acquisitions, trade names, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, patents and other intangible assets.\nAccounting rules require the evaluation of the Company\u2019s goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Such indicators include a sustained decline in the Company\u2019s stock price or market capitalization, adverse changes in economic or market conditions or prospects, and changes in the Company\u2019s operations.\nAn asset is considered to be impaired when its carrying value exceeds its fair value. The Company determines the fair value of an asset based upon the discounted cash flows expected to be realized from the use and ultimate disposition of the asset. If in conducting an impairment evaluation the Company determines that the carrying value of an asset exceeded its fair value, the Company would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset. If a significant amount of the Company\u2019s goodwill and intangible assets were deemed to be impaired, the Company\u2019s results of operations and shareholders\u2019 equity would be significantly adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to utilize all or a portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets may be limited significantly if the Company experiences an \u201cownership change.\u201d\nThe Company has a significant amount of U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards and other losses. The Company\u2019s ability to utilize the losses to offset future taxable income may be limited significantly if the Company were to experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). In general, an ownership change will occur if there is a cumulative change in ownership of the Company\u2019s stock by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined in the Code) that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred for purposes of Section 382 is complex and requires significant judgment. The extent to which the Company\u2019s ability to utilize the losses is limited as a result of such an ownership change depends on many variables, including the value of the Company\u2019s stock at the time of the ownership change. The Company continues to monitor changes in ownership. If such a cumulative increase did occur in any three year period and the Company were limited in the amount of losses it could use to offset taxable income, the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted.\nChanges in equipment standards under applicable Rules of Golf could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company seeks to have its new golf club and golf ball products satisfy the standards published by the USGA and The R&A in the Rules of Golf because these standards are generally followed by golfers, both professional and amateur, within their respective jurisdictions. The USGA publishes rules that are generally followed in the United States, Canada and Mexico, and The R&A publishes rules that are generally followed in most other countries throughout the world. However, the Rules of Golf as published by The R&A and the USGA are virtually the same and are intended to be so pursuant to a Joint Statement of Principles issued in 2001.\nIn the future, existing USGA and/or R&A standards may be altered in ways that adversely affect the sales of the Company\u2019s current or future products. If a change in rules were adopted and caused one or more of the Company\u2019s current or future products to be nonconforming, the Company\u2019s sales of such products would be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s sales and business could be materially and adversely affected if professional golfers do not endorse or use the Company\u2019s products.\nThe Company establishes relationships with professional golfers in order to evaluate and promote Callaway Golf and Odyssey branded products. The Company has entered into endorsement arrangements with members of the various professional tours, including the Champions Tour, the PGA Tour, the LPGA Tour, the PGA European Tour, the Japan Golf Tour and the Web.com Tour. While most professional golfers fulfill their contractual obligations, some have been known to stop using a sponsor\u2019s products despite contractual commitments. If certain of the Company\u2019s professional endorsers were to stop using the Company\u2019s products contrary to their endorsement agreements, the Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected in a material way by the negative publicity or lack of endorsement.\nThe Company believes that professional usage of its golf clubs and golf balls contributes to retail sales. The Company therefore spends a significant amount of money to secure professional usage of its products. Many other companies, however, also aggressively seek the patronage of these professionals and offer many inducements, including significant cash incentives and specially designed products. There is a great deal of competition to secure the representation of tour professionals. As a result, it is expensive to attract and retain such tour professionals. The inducements offered by other companies could result in a decrease in usage of the Company\u2019s products by professional golfers or limit the Company\u2019s ability to attract other tour professionals. A decline in the level of professional usage of the Company\u2019s products, or a significant increase in the cost to attract or retain endorsers, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s sales and business.\nThe Company\u2019s current senior management team and other key executives are critical to the Company\u2019s success, and the loss of, and failure to adequately replace, any such individual could significantly harm the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to maintain its competitive position is dependent to a large degree on the efforts and skills of the senior officers of the Company. The Company\u2019s executives are experienced and highly qualified with strong reputations in the golf industry, and the Company believes that its management team enables it to pursue the Company\u2019s strategic goals. In December 2014, the Company announced that Mr. Holiday plans to retire in 2015. The Company is currently conducting a search for his successor, and Mr. Holiday has agreed to continue as the Company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer until his replacement has been identified and a smooth transition has been effected. The success of the Company\u2019s business is dependent upon the management and leadership skills of its senior management team and other key personnel. Competition for these individuals\u2019 talents is intense, and the Company may not be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future. A prolonged delay in finding Mr. Holiday's replacement or the loss of one or more of these senior officers could have a material adverse affect upon the Company and its ability to achieve its strategic goals.\nFailure to adequately enforce the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights could adversely affect its reputation and sales.\nThe golf club industry, in general, has been characterized by widespread imitation of popular club designs. The Company has an active program of monitoring, investigating and enforcing its proprietary rights against companies and individuals who market or manufacture counterfeits and \u201cknockoff\u201d products. The Company asserts its rights against infringers of its copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade dress. However, these efforts may not be successful in reducing sales of golf products by these infringers. Additionally, other golf club manufacturers may be able to produce successful golf clubs which imitate the Company\u2019s designs without infringing any of the Company\u2019s copyrights, patents, trademarks or trade dress. The failure to prevent or limit such infringers or imitators could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation and sales.\nThe Company may become subject to intellectual property lawsuits that could cause it to incur significant costs or pay significant damages or that could prohibit it from selling its products.\nThe Company\u2019s competitors also seek to obtain patent, trademark, copyright or other protection of their proprietary rights and designs for golf clubs and golf balls. From time to time, third parties have claimed or may claim in the future that the Company\u2019s products infringe upon their proprietary rights. The Company evaluates any such claims and, where appropriate, has obtained or sought to obtain licenses or other business arrangements. To date, there have been no significant interruptions in the Company\u2019s business as a result of any claims of infringement. However, in the future, intellectual property claims could force the Company to alter its existing products or withdraw them from the market or could delay the introduction of new products.\nVarious patents have been issued to the Company\u2019s competitors in the golf industry and these competitors may assert that the Company\u2019s golf products infringe their patent or other proprietary rights. If the Company\u2019s golf products are found to infringe third-party intellectual property rights, the Company may be unable to obtain a license to use such technology, and it could incur substantial costs to redesign its products or to defend legal actions.\nRecent changes to U.S. patent laws and proposed changes to the rules of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to protect its intellectual property.\nThe Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \u201cLeahy-Smith Act\u201d), which was adopted in September 2011, includes a number of significant changes to the U.S. patent laws, such as, among other things, changing from a \u201cfirst to invent\u201d to a \u201cfirst inventor to file\u201d system, establishing new procedures for challenging patents and establishing different methods for invalidating patents. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has recently implemented regulations relating to these changes, and the courts have yet to address many of the new provisions of the Leahy-Smith Act. Some of these changes or potential changes may not be advantageous to the Company, and it may become more difficult to obtain adequate patent protection or to enforce the Company\u2019s patents against third parties. While the Company cannot predict the impact of the Leahy-Smith Act at this time, these changes or potential changes could increase the costs and uncertainties surrounding the prosecution of the Company\u2019s patent applications and adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to protect its intellectual property.\nThe Company\u2019s brands may be damaged by the actions of its licensees.\nThe Company licenses its trademarks to third-party licensees who produce, market and sell their products bearing the Company\u2019s trademarks. The Company chooses its licensees carefully and imposes upon such licensees various restrictions on the products, and on the manner, on which such trademarks may be used. In addition, the Company requires its licensees to abide by certain standards of conduct and the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business. However, if a licensee fails to adhere to these requirements, the Company\u2019s brands could be damaged. The Company\u2019s brands could also be damaged if a licensee becomes insolvent or by any negative publicity concerning a licensee or if the licensee does not maintain good relationships with its customers or consumers, many of which are also the Company\u2019s customers and consumers.\nSales of the Company\u2019s products by unauthorized retailers or distributors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s authorized distribution channels and harm the Company\u2019s reputation.\nSome of the Company\u2019s products find their way to unauthorized outlets or distribution channels. This \u201cgray market\u201d for the Company\u2019s products can undermine authorized retailers and foreign wholesale distributors who promote and support the Company\u2019s products, and can injure the Company\u2019s image in the minds of its customers and consumers. On the other hand, stopping such commerce could result in a potential decrease in sales to those customers who are selling the Company\u2019s products to unauthorized distributors or an increase in sales returns over historical levels. While the Company has taken some lawful steps to limit commerce of its products in the \u201cgray market\u201d in both the United States and abroad, it has not stopped such commerce.\nThe Company has significant international operations and is exposed to risks associated with doing business globally.\nThe Company sells and distributes its products directly in many key international markets in Europe, Asia, North America and elsewhere around the world. These activities have resulted and will continue to result in investments in inventory, accounts receivable, employees, corporate infrastructure and facilities. In addition, there are a limited number of suppliers of golf club components in the United States, and the Company has increasingly become more reliant on suppliers and vendors located outside of the United States. The operation of foreign distribution in the Company\u2019s international markets, as well as the management of relationships with international suppliers and vendors, will continue to require the dedication of management and other Company resources. The Company manufactures most of its products outside of the United States.\nAs a result of this international business, the Company is exposed to increased risks inherent in conducting business outside of the United States. In addition to foreign currency risks, these risks include:\n\u2022\nIncreased difficulty in protecting the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights and trade secrets;\n\u2022\nUnexpected government action or changes in legal or regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nSocial, economic or political instability;\n\u2022\nThe effects of any anti-American sentiments on the Company\u2019s brands or sales of the Company\u2019s products;\n\u2022\nIncreased difficulty in ensuring compliance by employees, agents and contractors with the Company\u2019s policies as well as with the laws of multiple jurisdictions, including but not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, local international environmental, health and safety laws, and increasingly complex regulations relating to the conduct of international commerce;\n\u2022\nIncreased difficulty in controlling and monitoring foreign operations from the United States, including increased difficulty in identifying and recruiting qualified personnel for its foreign operations; and\n\u2022\nIncreased exposure to interruptions in air carrier or ship services.\nAny significant adverse change in circumstances or conditions could have a significant adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s operations, financial performance and condition.\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the Company's effective income tax rate and profitability.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The Company's effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world, and any repatriation of non-US earnings for which the Company has not previously provided for U.S. taxes. The Company regularly assesses all of these matters to determine the adequacy of its tax provision, which is subject to significant discretion.\nThe Company relies on complex information systems for management of its manufacturing, distribution, sales and other functions. If the Company\u2019s information systems fail to perform these functions adequately or if the Company experiences an interruption in their operation, including a breach in cyber security, its business and results of operations could suffer.\nAll of the Company\u2019s major operations, including manufacturing, distribution, sales and accounting, are dependent upon the Company\u2019s complex information systems. The Company\u2019s information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\n\u2022\nEarthquake, fire, flood, hurricane and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\nPower loss, computer systems failure, Internet and telecommunications or data network failure; and\n\u2022\nHackers, computer viruses, software bugs or glitches.\nAny damage or significant disruption in the operation of such systems or the failure of the Company\u2019s information systems to perform as expected would disrupt the Company\u2019s business, which may result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess inventory and product shortages and otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations, financial performance and condition.", "PERMNO": 77366, "SIC": 3949, "TIC": "ELY"}
