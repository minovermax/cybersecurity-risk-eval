{"cik": "1084332", "company": "SALON MEDIA GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-06-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nSalon\u2019s business faces significant risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks Salon faces. Additional risks that are not yet known or that are currently immaterial may also impair its business operations or have a negative impact on its stock price. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs, its business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of its shares of common stock (the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d) could decline. The Risk Factors set forth below have not materially changed from those included in our Fiscal 2017 Annual Report.\nSalon has historically lacked significant revenues and has a history of losses.\nWe have a history of significant losses and expect to incur a loss from operations, based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, for our fiscal year ending March 31, 2019 and to be determined in future years. Even if we attain profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate or operating expenses exceed expectations, financial results will most likely be severely harmed and our ability to continue operations will be seriously jeopardized.\nM&K CPA\u2019s, PLLC, Salon\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2018 included a \u201cgoing-concern\u201d audit opinion on the financial statements for each of those years. The audit opinions report substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, citing issues such as the history of losses and absence of current profitability. As a result of the going-concern opinions, our stock price and investment prospects have been and will continue to be adversely affected, thus limiting financing choices and raising concerns about the realization of value on assets and operations.\nThe Company has operated in the past principally with the assistance of interest-free advances from related parties, and more recently by financing rounds in fiscal year 2018. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nSalon\u2019s projected cash flows may not meet expectations.\nWe rely on cash projections to run our business and change such projections as new information is made available or events occur. The most significant component of our cash projections is cash to be generated from advertising sales. Forecasting advertising revenues and resulting cash receipts for an extended period of time is problematic due to the short duration of most advertising sales contracts. If projected cash inflows and outflows do not meet expectations, our ability to continue as a going concern may be adversely affected.\nIf we forecast or experience periods of limited, or diminishing cash resources, we may need to sell additional securities or borrow additional funds. There is no guarantee that we will be able to issue additional securities in future periods or borrow additional funds on commercially reasonable terms to meet our cash needs. Our ability to continue as a going concern will be adversely affected if we are unable to raise additional cash from sources we have relied upon in the past or new sources.\nWe have relied on related parties for significant investment capital.\nOn January 24, 2017, Salon entered into a Purchase Agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) with purchasers identified therein (each, a \u201cPurchaser\u201d and together, the \u201cPurchasers\u201d) to issue and sell to the Purchasers in a private placement (the \u201cPrivate Placement\u201d) shares of Salon\u2019s Series A Mandatorily Convertible Voting Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d). The Series A Preferred Stock will automatically convert into shares of Common Stock upon the filing of the Amendment of Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) and resulting increase in authorized shares of Common Stock, which occurred on August 1, 2017. As reported in Salon\u2019s Current Reports on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) on January 27, 2017, March 27, 2017 and July 26, 2017, the Initial Closing of $1 million, the Second Closing of $0.215 million and the Final Closing of $0.275 million were completed on January 26, 2017, March 23, 2017 and July 20, 2017, respectively.\nWilliam Hambrecht, Elizabeth Hambrecht, Jordan Hoffner and Larry Hoffner, the father of our CEO Jordan Hoffner, were purchasers in the Initial Closing of the Private Placement. Jordan Hoffner, CEO, Ryan Nathanson, former Chief Operating Officer, and Jordana Brondo, former Chief Revenue Officer, were also purchasers in the Second Closing of the Private Placement. William Hambrecht, Elizabeth Harmbrecht and Jordan Hoffner were purchasers in the Final Closing of the Private Placement.\nCurtailment of cash investments and borrowing guarantees by related parties would detrimentally impact our cash availability and our ability to fund our operations.\nWe started collective bargaining with our non-supervisory editorial employees, and the results of this process are uncertain.\nOn August 3, 2015, the WGAE became the collective bargaining representative of Salon\u2019s non-supervisory editorial employees. We commenced collective bargaining with the WGAE in November 2015. Should this collective bargaining process result in an agreement that would not permit us to obtain additional funding, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue our current business.\nOur principal stockholders exercise a controlling influence over our business affairs and may make business decisions with which non-principal stockholders disagree, which may affect the value of non-principal stockholders\u2019 investments.\nAs of June 1, 2019, after the Closing of the Private Placement of an aggregate principal amount of $1.69 million of the Series A Preferred Stock and the conversion of advances into Series A Preferred Stock, approximately 67% of our voting securities are controlled, directly or indirectly by John Warnock, William Hambrecht and Spear Point Capital Fund, LP. These three investors, if aligned, could combine to make business decisions with which non-principal stockholders disagree, and which may affect the value of the non-principal stockholders\u2019 investments.\nFuture sales of significant number of shares of our Common Stock by principal stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nAs of June 1, 2019, our directors and officers owned approximately 200 million shares of Common Stock, on a fully diluted basis, including 107 million shares issuable upon conversion our Series A Preferred Stock, 24 million shares of Common Stock upon exercise of presently exercisable options and 11 million shares of Common Stock upon exercise of presently exercisable warrants and 27 million shares of common stock upon conversion of convertible notes. The 200 million shares, as converted, represent approximately 46% of fully diluted ownership. As our shares of Common Stock are normally thinly traded, if our principal stockholders were to sell their shares of Common Stock, the price per share of our shares of Common Stock could be adversely affected.\nThere can be no guarantees that the Asset Sale will be completed and, if not completed, we may have to file for bankruptcy and liquidation.\nThe consummation of the Asset Sale is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of various conditions, including the approval of the Asset Sale by our stockholders. We cannot guarantee that the closing conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement will be satisfied. If we are unable to satisfy the closing conditions in Buyer\u2019s favor or if other mutual closing conditions are not satisfied, Buyer will not be obligated to complete the Asset Sale. If the Asset Sale is not completed, our board of directors, in discharging its fiduciary obligations to our stockholders, will evaluate other strategic alternatives that may be available, which alternatives may not be as favorable to our stockholders as the Asset Sale and may include a bankruptcy and liquidation of the Company.\nThere can be no guarantee that Buyer will make its payments under the $3.8 million secured note delivered to us at closing, the failure of it do so which will reduce any amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.\nA substantial portion of the consideration to be received in connection with Asset Sale is the issuance by the Buyer thereunder of $3.8 million in secured notes, which amounts are due to be paid in equal installments on the 12 and 24 month anniversary of closing. Failure of the Buyer to make either of these payments will substantially reduce the amounts payable to our stockholders. While these notes are secured by our assets being sold in the Asset Sale, there is no guarantee that Buyer will make such payments.\nEven if the Asset Sale is consummated, we cannot assure you the amount of liquidating distributions, if any, that will be made to our stockholders or the exact timing of distributions.\nOur liquidation, dissolution and winding up process will be subject to uncertainties. The amount and timing of any liquidating distribution to our stockholders will depend on the following factors, among others:\n\u25cf\nwhether any potential claimants against us and currently unknown to us could present claims relating to our pre-dissolution operations that we may ultimately have to satisfy;\n\u25cf\nthe costs we may have to incur to defend new claims and claims existing as of the date of this proxy statement, including possible claims against us relating to our dissolution and possible tax audits;\n\u25cf\nthe payment of expenses incurred in connection with the Asset Sale and transaction expenses;\n\u25cf\nthe amounts that we will need to pay for general administrative and overhead costs and expenses as an operating company before our dissolution and the amounts that we will need to pay in connection with our post-dissolution survival period;\n\u25cf\nthe expenses that we may incur to terminate the leases for our offices;\n\u25cf\nthe costs attendant on us as a publicly held reporting company under SEC regulations, including legal and auditing fees, especially if we are unable to obtain relief from requirements to continue preparing and filing our annual, quarterly and current reports; and\n\u25cf\nhow much of our funds we will be required to reserve to provide for contingent liabilities, and how long it may take to finally determine whether and how much of those liabilities may have to be paid.\nWe may continue to incur expenses that will reduce any amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.\nClaims, liabilities and expenses from operations, such as operating costs, salaries, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance, payroll and local taxes, legal, accounting and consulting fees and offices expenses will continue to be incurred by us pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement and as we wind down. We cannot estimate what the aggregate of these expenses will be, but they will reduce the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders.\nWhile the Asset Sale is pending, it creates uncertainty about our future, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile the Asset Sale is pending, it creates uncertainty about our future. Therefore, our current or potential business partners may decide to delay, defer or cancel entering into new business arrangements with us pending consummation of the Asset Sale or termination of the Asset Purchase Agreement. In addition, while the Asset Sale is pending, we are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf\nthe diversion of management and employee attention from our day-to-day business, which impacts our ability to operate our business in the ordinary course and generate revenues;\n\u25cf\nthe loss of employees who may depart due to their concern about losing their jobs following the Asset Sale or a shift in loyalty of employees of the Company who see the Buyer as their de facto employer even before the consummation of the Asset Sale; and\n\u25cf\nour inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future opportunities.\nThe occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have also incurred substantial transaction costs in connection with the Asset Sale, and we will continue to do so until the consummation of the Asset Sale. Following the consummation of the Asset Sale, we will continue to incur substantial operating expenses to comply with our obligations to perform transition services pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement.\nThe Asset Purchase Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the Asset Sale.\nThe Asset Purchase Agreement contains provisions that make it substantially more difficult for us to sell the Company\u2019s assets to a party other than the Buyer. Specifically, we agreed not to solicit any acquisition proposals until the date of closing or the proper termination of the Asset Purchase Agreement except that, in response to a superior proposal or a highly material intervening event, our board may, among other actions, withdraw or materially modify its recommendation contained in this proxy statement to adopt the Asset Purchase Agreement or recommend the adoption of an alternative acquisition proposal, if our board concludes in good faith (after consultation with outside legal and financial advisors) that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to cause our board to breach its fiduciary duties under applicable law.\nThe failure to consummate the Asset Sale may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Buyer\u2019s obligation to close the Asset Sale is subject to a number of conditions, including our stockholders\u2019 approval of the Asset Sale Proposal. We cannot control some of these conditions and we cannot assure you that they will be satisfied or that the Buyer will waive any that are not satisfied. If the Asset Sale is not consummated, we may be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to identify an alternate transaction, or if an alternate transaction is identified, such alternate transaction may not result in an equivalent price to what is proposed in the Asset Sale;\n\u25cf\nthe trading price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the then current market price reflects a market assumption that the Asset Sale will be consummated;\n\u25cf\nour relationships with our customers, suppliers and employees may be damaged beyond repair and the value of our assets will likely significantly decline; and\nThe occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination will likely materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, cause the market value of our common stock to significantly decline or become worthless and force us to file for bankruptcy protection, liquidate and windup our operations.\nThe failure to consummate the Asset Sale by the prescribed deadline will likely result in the Asset Sale being abandoned.\nEither the Buyer or the Company may terminate the Asset Purchase Agreement without penalty if (i) our stockholders do not approve the Asset Sale Proposal or (\u00fc) if the Asset Sale is otherwise not completed by September 2, 2019 (unless such deadline is missed due to a breach by the party seeking termination of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in the Asset Purchase Agreement). In the event the Asset Purchase Agreement is terminated, the potential adverse effects from failing to consummate the Asset Sale discussed above would be implicated.\nOur executive officers and directors may have interests in the Asset Sale other than, or in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally.\nMembers of our board of directors and our executive officers may have interests in the Asset Sale that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of our stockholders generally. Our board of directors was aware of these interests and considered them, among other matters, in approving the Asset Purchase Agreement.\nWe will no longer be an operating company following the closing of the Asset Sale.\nIf the stockholders approve the Asset Purchase Agreement and we complete the Asset Sale, we intend to cease to do business and intend to not engage in any business activities except for dealing with post-closing matters (in the event the Asset Sale is consummated) and for the purpose of liquidating our remaining assets, paying any debts and obligations, distributing the remaining assets to stockholders, and doing other acts required to liquidate and wind up our business and affairs. We will pay or make provision for payment of our known or reasonably ascertainable liabilities that have been incurred or are expected to be incurred prior to liquidation. After that, we intend to distribute the remaining assets to our stockholders in proportion to their respective stockholder interest in the Company.\nThe tax treatment of the Asset Sale may vary from stockholder to stockholder.\nWe have not requested a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) with respect to the anticipated tax consequences of the Asset Sale, and we will not seek an opinion of counsel with respect to the anticipated tax consequences of the Asset Sale. Tax considerations applicable to particular stockholders may vary with and be contingent upon the stockholder\u2019s individual circumstances.\nThe recent resignation of Jordan Hoffner as our Chief Executive Officer may affect our ability to successfully close the Asset Sale.\nJordan Hoffner resigned as our Chief Executive Officer on May 3, 2019. This may affect our ability to successfully close the Asset Sale, the failure of which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert our attention.\nWe may be subject to securities class action litigation in connection with the Asset Sale. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from closing the Asset Sale, which could harm our business and increase our expenses, which could decrease the amount available for distribution to our stockholders.\nFollowing consummation of the Asset Sale, we may no longer be required to file reports with the SEC.\nWe may file a notice terminating our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act following completion of the Asset Sale. Once effective, we may no longer be required to file any annual, quarterly or other current reports with the SEC. If we are no longer required to file reports with the SEC, stockholders will have very little public information available about us and our operations which will further affect the trading and liquidity of our Common Stock.\nExisting stockholders may experience significant dilution from the issuance of our Common Stock pursuant to our recently issued convertible notes, Series A Preferred Stock, and warrants.\nAs of June 1, 2019, we have $845,000 in convertible notes issued as part of a bridge note financing. These notes will convert at a discount into shares of Common Stock upon a qualified financing by the Company of at least $1 million. The conversion price will equal to 70% of the price per share paid in the qualified financing if such financing occurs within four months from the date of the Securities Purchase Agreement, or 70% less 2% per each month after the fourth month anniversary; provided however that the Conversion Price will never be less than the greater of (A) sixty percent (60%) of the purchase price paid in the qualified financing and (B) the price per share paid by investors in the most recently consummated offering of the Company\u2019s Common Stock, or $0.0124 per share, the conversion price in the Series A Mandatorily Convertible Preferred Private Placement, if the financing occurs more than four months after the date of the Securities Purchase Agreement. The issuance and sale of our Common Stock to these bridge note holders for any conversions may have a dilutive impact on our shareholders.\nFrom June 2018 through August 2018, we received $114.5 in advances from related parties. These advances accrued interest at a rate of 10% per annum and payable on the one-year anniversary of such advances. On December 7, 2018, these advances and all accrued interest were exchanged for secured notes in the amount of approximately $118.9. These notes bear a 10% interest rate and are payable on June 30, 2019. In addition, on December 7, 2018, we issued warrants to the secured note holders to purchase 11,312,600 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The warrants expire five years from the issuance date and can be exercised with cash or cancellation of the secured notes referenced above.\nIn addition, if we fail to close the Asset Purchase Agreement or breach the term sheet related to such Asset Purchase Agreement, the $500,000 advanced by PubLife, LLC will convert into a senior secured convertible promissory note, which note would bear interest and be due 90 days from issue and at the election of the PubLife, the outstanding principal amount and all accrued unpaid interest on the note would be convertible into fully paid and non-assessable shares of the our Common Stock at a price per share equal to $0.03.\nWe currently have 1,648,830 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding. We intend to convert these shares of Series A Preferred Stock into 164,883,000 shares of our Common Stock prior to June 30, 2019\nOur stock has been, and will likely continue to be, subjected to substantial price and volume fluctuations due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control and which may prevent our stockholders from reselling Common Stock at a profit.\nThe securities markets can experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could affect the market price of our shares of Common Stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, our stock is thinly traded. Even a few transactions, whether in response to disappointment in our expected operating results or for any other reason, could cause the market price of our shares of Common Stock to decrease significantly.\nWe depend on advertising sales for substantially all of our revenues, and our inability to maintain or increase advertising revenues would harm our business.\nOur ability to maintain or increase our advertising revenues depends upon many factors, including whether we will be able to:\n\u25cf\nattract and maintain additional visitors to our Website and increase brand awareness;\n\u25cf\nsell and market our Website or other rich media advertisements;\n\u25cf\nmaintain a significant number of sellable impressions generated from Website visitors available to advertisers;\n\u25cf\nincrease the dollar amount of our advertising orders;\n\u25cf\nimprove our Website\u2019s technology for serving advertising;\n\u25cf\nhandle temporary high volume traffic spikes to our Website;\n\u25cf\nmeasure accurately the number and demographic characteristics of our users; and\n\u25cf\nattract and retain key sales personnel.\nAs more of our users access our Website using mobile devices rather than PCs, if we do not continue to grow our mobile users and revenue, our business will be adversely impacted.\nInternet users increasingly use mobile devices rather than PCs to access the Internet. Approximately 66% of our monthly users are now visiting our Website on mobile devices. As mobile platforms encompass a larger share of our readers, our ability to grow advertising revenue is increasingly dependent on our ability to generate revenue from advertisements displayed on mobile devices. While we plan to continue to devote technology resources to support our mobile browser product and advertising products, if our mobile browser product and advertising products for mobile devices do not attract and retain users and advertisers to generate mobile revenue, our operating and financial results will be adversely impacted. We are dependent upon our products operating on mobile operating systems we do not control. The mobile phone manufacturer and its operating systems might block access to our Website or make it hard for users to find our Website through their devices, or block certain advertisements or charge us for delivery of advertisements, all of which would harm our operations and suppress revenue potential.\nTechnologies and software applications could block our advertisements, which could harm our operating results.\nTechnologies and software applications have been developed for PC and mobile devices that can block or allow users to opt out of display advertising, delete or block cookies used to deliver advertising, or move advertising to less optimal placements to suppress view-ability. Most of our advertising revenue is derived from display or video advertisements on our Website. As a result, ad-blocking technologies or software could reduce the number of display or video advertisements, which could result in decreased revenue.\nIf we cannot increase referrals from social media platforms, our ability to attract new unique visitors and maintain the engagement of existing unique visitors could be adversely affected.\nAs the behavior of internet consumers continues to change, distribution of our content, products and services via traditional methods may become less effective, and new distribution strategies may need to be developed. Consumers are increasingly using social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to communicate and to acquire and disseminate information. As consumers migrate towards social networks, we continue to build social elements into our content, products and services in order to make them available on social networks and to attract and engage consumers on our Website and mobile platforms. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate our content with such social networking or other new consumer trends. Even if we are able to distribute our content, products and services effectively through social networking or other new or developing distribution channels, this does not assure that we will be able to attract new unique visitors or generate additional pageviews that can be monetized by our advertising sales team.\nHackers may attempt to penetrate our security system and online security breaches could harm our business.\nConsumer and supplier confidence in our Website depends on maintaining strong security features. Experienced programmers or \u201chackers\u201d have penetrated sectors of our systems, and we expect that these attempts will continue to occur from time to time. To our knowledge, there has been no outward harm to us or our users as a result of hacking attempts. Furthermore, Salon has engaged the services of a third-party web application security-testing company, which conducts regular comprehensive searches for any vulnerabilities that may exist, allowing us to address and fix any issues before they can be exploited. This minimizes the risk of damage; however, because a hacker who is able to penetrate network security could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our products and services, we may have to expend significant capital and resources to protect against or to alleviate problems caused by hackers. Additionally, we may not have a timely remedy against a hacker who is able to penetrate our network security. Such security breaches could materially affect our operations, damage our reputation and expose us to risk of loss or litigation. In addition, the transmission of computer viruses resulting from hackers or otherwise could expose us to significant liability. Our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches. We also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with whom we have relationships.\nWe must promote the Salon brand to attract and retain users, advertisers and strategic partners.\nThe success of the Salon brand depends largely on our ability to provide high quality content and services. If Internet users do not perceive our existing content and services to be of high quality, or if we introduce new content and services or enter into new business ventures that are not favorably perceived by users, we may not be successful in promoting and maintaining the Salon brand. Any change in the focus of our operations creates a risk of diluting our brand, confusing consumers and decreasing the value of our user base to advertisers. If we are unable to maintain or grow the Salon brand, our business would be severely harmed.\nWe must hire, integrate and/or retain qualified personnel to support our business plans.\nOur success significantly depends on key personnel. In addition, because our users must perceive the content of our Website as having been created by credible and notable sources, our success also depends on the name recognition and reputation of our editorial staff. Due to our history of losses, we may experience difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. We may be unable to retain our current key employees or attract, integrate or retain other qualified employees in the future. If we do not succeed in attracting new personnel or retaining and motivating our current personnel, our business would be harmed.\nOur success depends on our key personnel, including our executive officers, and the loss of key personnel, including our acting CEO, could disrupt our business.\nOur success greatly depends on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key sales, marketing and operations personnel. While we have employment agreements with some key management, these employees may voluntarily terminate their employment at any time. We may not be able to successfully retain existing personnel or identify, hire and integrate new personnel. We do not have key person insurance policies in place for these employees.\nWe may expend significant resources to protect our intellectual property rights or to defend claims of infringement by third parties, and if we are not successful we may lose rights to use significant material or be required to pay significant fees.\nOur success and ability to compete are dependent on our proprietary content. We rely exclusively on copyright law to protect our content. While we actively take steps to protect our proprietary rights, these steps may not be adequate to prevent the infringement or misappropriation of our content, which could severely harm our business. We also license content from various freelance providers and other third-party content providers. While we attempt to ensure that such content may be freely licensed to us, other parties may assert claims of infringement against us relating to such content.\nWe may need to obtain licenses from others to refine, develop, market and deliver new services. We may not be able to obtain any such licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all or rights granted pursuant to any licenses may not be valid and enforceable.\nIn April 1999, we acquired the Internet address www.salon.com. Because www.salon.com is the address of the main home page to our Website and incorporates Salon\u2019s name, it is a vital part of our intellectual property assets. We do not have a registered trademark on the address, and therefore it may be difficult for us to prevent a third party from infringing on our intellectual property rights to the address. If we fail to adequately protect our rights to the Website address, or if a third party infringes our rights to the address, or otherwise dilutes the value of www.salon.com, our business could be harmed.\nOur technology development efforts may not be successful in improving the functionality of our network, which could result in reduced traffic on our Website or reduced advertising revenues.\nWe are constantly upgrading our technology to manage our Website. During the last several years, we redesigned our Website homepage and vertical sections. In addition, we are creating new technology for new products that we expect to launch on an ongoing basis. If these systems do not work as intended, or if we are unable to continue to develop these systems to keep up with the rapid evolution of technology for content delivery, our Website may not operate properly, which could harm our business. Additionally, software product design, development and enhancement involve creativity, expense and the use of new development tools and learning processes. Delays in software development processes are common, as are project failures, and either factor could harm our business. Moreover, complex software products such as our online publishing platform frequently contain undetected errors or shortcomings, and may fail to perform or scale as expected. Although we have tested and will continue to test our systems, errors or deficiencies may be found in these systems that could adversely impact our business.\nWe rely on third parties to provide the technologies necessary to deliver content, advertising and services to our users, and any change in the licensing terms, costs, availability, or acceptance of these formats and technologies could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on third parties to provide the technologies that we use to deliver content, advertising, and services to our users. There can be no assurance that these providers will continue to license their technologies or intellectual property to us on reasonable terms, or at all. Providers may change the fees they charge users or otherwise change their business models in a manner that slows the widespread acceptance of their technologies. In order for our services to be successful, there must be a large base of users of the technologies to deliver our content, advertising, and services. We have limited or no control over the availability or acceptance of those technologies, and any change in licensing terms, costs, availability, or user acceptance of these technologies could adversely affect our business.\nWe may be held liable for content or third party links on our Website or content distributed to third parties.\nAs a publisher and distributor of content over the Internet, including links to third-party websites that may be accessible through our Website, or content that includes links or references to a third-party\u2019s website, we face potential liability for defamation, negligence, copyright, patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the nature, content or ownership of the material that is published on or distributed from our Website. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes successfully, against online services, websites and print publications in the past. Other claims may be based on errors or false or misleading information provided on linked websites, including information deemed to constitute professional advice such as legal, medical, financial or investment advice. Other claims may be based on links to sexually explicit websites. Although we carry general liability and media insurance, our insurance may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liabilities imposed. Any liability that is not covered by our insurance or is in excess of our insurance coverage could severely harm our financial condition and business. Implementing measures to reduce our exposure to these forms of liability may require us to spend substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our service to users.\nOur systems may fail due to natural disasters, telecommunications failures and other events, any of which would limit user traffic.\nOur Website, Salon.com, and content management system run on cloud computing hosted by Amazon Web Services, which are in facilities located in Virginia, Washington and Ireland. Any disruption of Amazon\u2019s cloud computing platform could result in a service outage. Fire, floods, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins, supplier failure to meet commitments, and similar events could damage these systems and cause interruptions in our services. Computer viruses, electronic break-ins or other similar disruptive problems could cause users to stop visiting our Website and could cause advertisers to terminate any agreements with us. In addition, we could lose advertising revenues during these interruptions and user satisfaction could be negatively impacted if the service is slow or unavailable. If any of these circumstances occurred, our business could be harmed. Our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur due to any failures of or interruptions in our systems. We do not presently have a formal disaster recovery plan.\nOur Website must accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver frequently updated information. It is possible that we will experience systems failures in the future and that such failures could harm our business. In addition, our users depend on Internet service providers, online service providers and other website operators for access to our Website. Many of these providers and operators have experienced significant outages in the past, and could experience outages, delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our systems. Any of these system failures could harm our business.\nPrivacy concerns could impair our business.\nWe have a policy against using personally identifiable information obtained from users of our Website and services without the user\u2019s permission. In the past, the Federal Trade Commission has investigated companies that have used personally identifiable information without permission or in violation of a stated privacy policy. If we use personal information without permission or in violation of our policy, we may face potential liability for invasion of privacy for compiling and providing information to our corporate customers and electronic commerce merchants. In addition, legislative or regulatory requirements may heighten these concerns if businesses must notify Internet users that the data may be used by marketing entities to direct product promotion and advertising to the user. Other countries and political entities, such as the European Union, have adopted such legislation or regulatory requirements. The United States may adopt similar legislation or regulatory requirements in the future. If consumer privacy concerns are not adequately addressed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nDue to the volatility of the price of our Common Stock, we may be the target of securities litigation, which is costly and time-consuming to defend.\nThe price of our Common Stock has experienced volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. In the past, following volatility in the price of a company\u2019s securities, securities holders have instituted class action litigation against such company. Many companies have been subjected to this type of litigation. If the market value of our Common Stock experiences adverse fluctuations and we become involved in this type of litigation, regardless of the merits or outcome, we could incur substantial legal costs and our management\u2019s attention could be diverted, causing our business, financial condition and operating results to suffer. To date, we have not been subject to such litigation.\nWe have secured debt outstanding. If we were unable to service our debt, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe currently have secured notes issued to certain of our directors in the amount of approximately $118,836 which is due on June 30, 2019. If we were unable obtain an extension or if we fail to pay our debt obligations in a timely fashion, we will be in default under these secured notes. If we default on these notes, such could exercise its rights and remedies under the secured notes, which could include seizing all of our assets. Any such action would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nOur quarterly operating results are volatile and may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.\nOur future revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control, and any of which could severely harm our business. These factors include:\n\u25cf\nour ability to attract and retain advertisers;\n\u25cf\nour ability to attract and retain a large number of users;\n\u25cf\nour ability to increase referrals from our social media presence;\n\u25cf\nthe introduction of new websites, services or products by us or by our competitors;\n\u25cf\nour ability to maximize our mobile presence;\n\u25cf\nthe timing and uncertainty of our advertising sales cycles;\n\u25cf\nthe mix of advertisements sold by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\neconomic and business cycles;\n\u25cf\nour ability to attract, integrate and retain qualified personnel;\n\u25cf\ntechnical difficulties or system downtime affecting the Internet generally or the operation of our Website; and\n\u25cf\nthe amount and timing of operating costs.\nDue to the factors noted above and the other risks discussed in this section and throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the \u201cForm 10-K\u201d), one should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of future performance. It is possible that some future periods\u2019 results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. If this occurs, the price of our Common Stock may decline.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting were determined to be ineffective at March 31, 2018 and we identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting as of March 31, 2018, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting.\nComplying with Section 404 requires a rigorous compliance program as well as adequate time and resources. As a result of developing, improving and expanding our core information technology systems as well as implementing new systems to support our sales, engineering, supply chain and manufacturing activities, all of which require significant management time and support, we may not be able to complete our internal control evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. For the period ended March 31, 2018, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. As such we were unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. This could result in the loss of investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe have no immediate plans to pay dividends.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends to date and do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. We intend to retain earnings, if any, as necessary to finance the operation and expansion of our business.\nThere is a limited trading market for our Common Stock.\nOur Common Stock is traded on the OTC Markets (QB Marketplace Tier) under the symbol \u201cSLNM.\u201d During the 30-days prior to filing of this Report, the average daily trading volume of our common stock was approximately 10,177 shares. There has been limited trading activity in our stock recently, and when it has traded, the price has fluctuated widely. We consider our Common Stock to be \u201cthinly traded\u201d and any last reported sale prices may not be a true market-based valuation of the Common Stock. A consistently active trading market for our stock may not develop at any time in the future. Stockholders may experience difficulty selling their shares if they choose to do so because of the illiquid market and limited public float for our stock.\nOur Common Stock is considered to be a \u201cpenny stock\u201d and, as such, the market for our common stock may be further limited by certain SEC rules applicable to penny stocks.\nAs long as the price of our Common Stock remains below $5.00 per share or we have net tangible assets of $2,000,000 or less, our shares of Common Stock are likely to be subject to certain \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules promulgated by the SEC. Those rules impose certain sales practice requirements on brokers who sell penny stock to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000). For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, the broker must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to the sale. Furthermore, the penny stock rules generally require, among other things, that brokers engaged in secondary trading of penny stocks provide customers with written disclosure documents, monthly statements of the market value of penny stocks, disclosure of the bid and asked prices and disclosure of the compensation to the brokerage firm and disclosure of the sales person working for the brokerage firm. These rules and regulations make it more difficult for brokers to sell our shares of our Common Stock and limit the liquidity of our securities.\nTransfers of our securities may be restricted by virtue of state securities \u201cblue sky\u201d laws which prohibit trading absent compliance with individual state laws. These restrictions may make it difficult or impossible to sell shares in those states.\nTransfers of our Common Stock may be restricted under the securities or securities regulations laws promulgated by various states and foreign jurisdictions, commonly referred to as \u201cblue sky\u201d laws. Absent compliance with such individual state laws, our Common Stock may not be traded in such jurisdictions. Because the securities registered hereunder have not been registered for resale under the blue-sky laws of any state, the holders of such shares and persons who desire to purchase them should be aware that there may be significant state blue sky law restrictions upon the ability of investors to sell the securities and of purchasers to purchase the securities. These restrictions may prohibit the secondary trading of our Common Stock. Investors should consider the secondary market for our securities to be a limited one.\nWe have the ability to issue additional shares of our Common Stock and shares of Preferred Stock without asking for stockholder approval, which could cause your investment to be diluted.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the Board to issue up to 900,000,000 shares of common stock and up to 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock. The power of the Board to issue shares of Common Stock, Preferred Stock or warrants or options to purchase shares of common stock or Preferred Stock is generally not subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, any additional issuance of our Common Stock, or Preferred Stock that may be convertible into Common Stock, may have the effect of diluting your investment.\nBy issuing Preferred Stock, we may be able to delay, defer or prevent a change of control.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation permits us to issue, without approval from our shareholders, a total of 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock. Our Board can determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to, or imposed upon, the shares of Preferred Stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series. It is possible that our Board, in determining the rights, preferences and privileges to be granted when the Preferred Stock is issued, may include provisions that have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control, discouraging bids for our Common Stock at a premium over the market price, or that adversely affect the market price of and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Common Stock.\nProvisions in Delaware law and our charter, stock option agreements and offer letters to executive officers may prevent or delay a change of control.\nWe are subject to the Delaware anti-takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers. These anti-takeover laws prevent a Delaware corporation from engaging in a merger or sale of more than 10% of its assets with any stockholder, including all affiliates and associates of the stockholder, who owns 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock, for three years following the date that the stockholder acquired 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s assets unless:\n\u25cf\nthe Board approved the transaction in which the stockholder acquired 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s assets;\n\u25cf\nafter the transaction in which the stockholder acquired 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s assets, the stockholder owned at least 85% of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock, excluding shares owned by directors, officers and employee stock plans in which employee participants do not have the right to determine confidentially whether shares held under the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer; or\n\u25cf\non or after such date, the merger or sale is approved by the Board and the holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the stockholder.\nA Delaware corporation may opt out of the Delaware anti-takeover laws if its Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws so provide. We have not opted out of the provisions of the anti-takeover laws. As such, these laws could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeovers or changes of control of Salon and may discourage attempts by other companies to acquire us.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws include a provision relating to special meetings of our shareholders that may deter or impede hostile takeovers or changes of control or management. Special meetings of stockholders may be called only by the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors (whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board for adoption) or by the holders of not less than 10% of all of the shares entitled to cast votes at the meeting. This provision may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control.\nIn addition, employment agreements with certain executive officers provide for the payment of severance and acceleration of the vesting of options and restricted stock in the event of termination of the executive officer following a change of control of Salon. These provisions could have the effect of discouraging potential takeover attempts.", "PERMNO": 86995, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "SLNM"}
