In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-K, including the information addressed under \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d investors in the Company\u2019s securities should carefully consider the factors discussed below. These factors could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and capital position and could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from its historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K, in which case the trading price of the Company\u2019s securities could decline. The Risk Factor Summary that follows should be read in conjunction with the detailed description of risk factors below.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThese risks and uncertainties include:\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\u25cf The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions have already adversely impacted the Company\u2019s business and results, and could adversely impact its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Lending Activities\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s ACL may prove to be insufficient to absorb credit losses in its loan portfolio.\n\u25cf The Bank\u2019s concentration in loans secured by real estate may adversely affect earnings due to changes in the real estate markets.\n\u25cf The Bank has significant credit exposure in commercial real estate, and loans with this type of collateral are viewed as having more risk of default.\n\u25cf The Bank\u2019s loan portfolio contains construction and development loans, and a decline in real estate values or economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the loans and have an adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s financial condition.\n\u25cf The Bank\u2019s commercial and industrial loans have contributed significantly to the Bank\u2019s loan growth. A weakening of economic conditions could adversely affect the collectability of the loans and underlying collateral.\n\u25cf Loans that the Bank has made through federal programs are dependent on the federal government\u2019s continuation and support of these programs and on the Bank\u2019s compliance with program requirements.\n\u25cf The Bank relies upon independent appraisals to determine the value of the real estate which secures a significant portion of its loans, and the values indicated by such appraisals may not be realizable if the Bank is forced to foreclose upon such loans.\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s credit standards and its on-going credit assessment processes might not protect it from significant credit losses.\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s focus on lending to small to mid-sized community-based businesses may increase its credit risk.\n\u25cf Nonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s mortgage revenue is cyclical and is sensitive to the level of interest rates, changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market, any of which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s profits.\nRisks Related to Market Interest Rates\n\u25cf Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s income and cash flows.\n\u25cf The phasing out and ultimate replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate and changes in the manner of calculating other reference rates may adversely impact the value of loans and other financial instruments the Company holds that are linked to LIBOR or other reference rates in ways that are difficult to predict and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business, Industry and Markets\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\n\u25cf Adverse changes in economic conditions in Virginia, Maryland, or North Carolina or adverse conditions in an industry on which a local market in which the Company does business relies could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business in a material way.\n\u25cf Changes in U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, may adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25cf The Company faces substantial competition that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s growth and/or operating results.\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s consumers may increasingly decide not to use the Bank to complete their financial transactions, which would have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operations.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Operations\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s operations may be adversely affected by cyber security risks and cyber-attacks.\n\u25cf The inability of the Company to successfully manage its growth or to implement its growth strategy may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial conditions.\n\u25cf Difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with the Company\u2019s own operations may prevent the Company from achieving the expected benefits from acquisitions.\n\u25cf The carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may be adversely affected.\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s risk-management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s exposure to operational, technological, and organizational risk may adversely affect the Company.\n\u25cf The Company continually encounters technological change which could affect its ability to remain competitive.\n\u25cf The operational functions of business counterparties over which the Company may have limited or no control may experience disruptions that could adversely impact the Company.\n\u25cf The Company and the Bank rely on other companies to provide key components of their business infrastructure.\n\u25cf The Company depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties, and its financial condition could be adversely affected if it relies on misleading information.\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s dependency on its management team and the unexpected loss of any of those personnel could adversely affect operations.\n\u25cf The Company may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize its deferred tax assets.\n\u25cf Sales of the Company\u2019s common stock in connection with merger or acquisition activity, or other capital transactions may result in an ownership change of control, thus limiting the Company\u2019s ability to realize its deferred tax assets.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Regulatory Environment\n\u25cf The Company is subject to additional regulation, increased supervision and increased costs compared to some financial institutions because the Company\u2019s assets exceed $10 billion.\n\u25cf Current and proposed regulation addressing consumer privacy and data use and security could increase the Company\u2019s costs and impact its reputation.\n\u25cf The Company is subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements as a result of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and the Dodd-Frank Act, which could adversely affect its return on equity and otherwise affect its business.\n\u25cf The Bank is subject to the CFPB\u2019s broad regulatory authority and new regulations, or new approaches to regulation or enforcement by the CFPB could adversely impact the Company.\n\u25cf Failure to comply with the USA Patriot Act, OFAC, the Bank Secrecy Act and related FinCEN guidelines and related regulations could have a material impact on the Company.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Securities\n\u25cf The Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for substantially all of its revenue.\n\u25cf An active trading market in the Company\u2019s common stock may not be sustained.\n\u25cf Future issuances of the Company\u2019s common stock or preferred stock could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and preferred stock and could be dilutive.\n\u25cf Common stock and preferred stock are equity and are subordinate to the Company\u2019s existing and future indebtedness and effectively subordinated to all the indebtedness and other non- equity claims against the Bank and the Company\u2019s other subsidiaries.\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s common stock is subordinate to the Company\u2019s existing and future preferred stock.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions have already adversely impacted the Company\u2019s business and results, and could have a more material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the United States and international economies and financial markets. The spread of COVID-19 in the United States has caused illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in commercial activity and\nfinancial transactions, supply chain interruptions, increased unemployment, and overall economic and financial market instability. In March 2020, almost all states, including Virginia, where the Company is headquartered, and Maryland and North Carolina, in which the Company has significant operations, issued \u201cstay-at-home orders\u201d and declared states of emergency. Many state and local governments began implementing phased regulations and guidelines for reopening communities and economies, often with reduced capacity and social distancing restrictions. However, recently, many state and local governments have implemented additional restrictions in light of the significant COVID-19 resurgence.\nAlthough banks have generally been permitted to continue operating, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions to the Company\u2019s business and could cause material disruptions to its business and operations in the future. Impacts to the business have included increases in costs and reductions in operating effectiveness due to additional health and safety precautions implemented at the Company\u2019s branches and offices and the transition of a portion of its workforce to home locations, decreases in customer traffic in its branches, and increases in requests for and the making of loan modifications. The Company anticipates that additional future impacts to its business will include increases in the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 inability to make scheduled loan payments and increases in requests for forbearance. Further, loan payment deferment programs implemented by the Company or under government stimulus programs, like the PPP, may mask credit deterioration in its loan portfolio by making less applicable standard measures of identifying developing financial weakness in a client or portfolio, such as past due monitoring and non-accrual assessments. To the extent that commercial and social restrictions remain in place or increase, the Company\u2019s expenses, delinquencies, charge-offs, foreclosures, and credit losses may materially increase, and the Company could experience reductions in fee income. In addition, any declines in credit quality could significantly affect the adequacy of the Company\u2019s ACL, which would lead to increases in the provision for credit losses and related declines in its net income.\nUnfavorable economic conditions and increasing unemployment figures may also make it more difficult for the Company to maintain deposit levels and loan origination volume and to obtain additional financing. Furthermore, such conditions have and may continue to cause the value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and of collateral associated with its existing loans to decline. In addition, in March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds rate to a range from 0 to 0.25 percent in part as a result of the pandemic. A prolonged period of very low interest rates could reduce the Company\u2019s net interest income and have a material adverse impact on its cash flows.\nWhile the Company has taken and is continuing to take precautions to protect the safety and well-being of its employees and customers, no assurance can be given that the steps being taken will be deemed to be adequate or appropriate, nor can the Company predict the continued level of disruption that will occur to its employee's ability to provide customer support and service. The continued, renewed, or increased spread of COVID-19 could negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct the Company\u2019s business, the business and operations of its third-party service providers who perform critical services for the business, or the businesses of many of the Company\u2019s customers and borrowers. If COVID-19 is not successfully contained, the Company could experience a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nAmong the factors outside the Company\u2019s control that are likely to affect the impact the COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately have on its business are, without limitation:\n\u25cf the pandemic\u2019s duration, nature, and severity;\n\u25cf the uncertainty regarding new variants of COVID-19 that have emerged;\n\u25cf the speed and efficacy of vaccine and treatment developments;\n\u25cf the direct and indirect results of the pandemic, such as recessionary economic trends, including with respect to employment, wages and benefits, commercial activity, the residential housing market, consumer spending and real estate and investment securities market values;\n\u25cf political, legal, and regulatory actions and policies in response to the pandemic, including the effects of restrictions on commerce and banking, such as temporary or required suspensions of collections, foreclosures, and related obligations;\n\u25cf the timing, magnitude, and effect of public spending, directly or through subsidies, its direct and indirect effects on commercial activity and incentives of employers and individuals to resume or increase employment, wages and benefits, and commercial activity;\n\u25cf effects on the Company\u2019s liquidity position due to changes in customers\u2019 deposit and loan activity in response to the pandemic and its economic effects;\n\u25cf the timing and availability of direct and indirect governmental support for various financial assets, including mortgage loans;\n\u25cf the long-term effect of the economic downturn on the Company\u2019s intangible assets such as its deferred tax asset and goodwill;\n\u25cf potential longer-term effects of increased government spending on the interest rate environment and borrowing costs for non-governmental parties;\n\u25cf the ability of the Company\u2019s employees to work effectively during the course of the pandemic;\n\u25cf the ability of the Company\u2019s third-party vendors to maintain a high-quality and effective level of service;\n\u25cf the possibility of increased fraud, cybercrime, and similar incidents, due to vulnerabilities posed by the significant increase in Company employees and customers handling their banking interactions remotely from home, the quick roll-out of various government-sponsored lending programs, like the PPP, or otherwise;\n\u25cf required changes to the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting to reflect a rapidly changing work environment;\n\u25cf potential longer-term shifts toward mobile banking, telecommuting, and telecommerce;\n\u25cf short- and long-term health impacts;\n\u25cf unforeseen effects of the pandemic; and\n\u25cf geographic variation in the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including in states in which the Company operates physically such as Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to severe volatility in the financial markets. Depending on the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and perceptions regarding national and global recovery from the pandemic, the price of the Company\u2019s common stock may continue to experience volatility and potential declines.\nThe Company is continuing to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and related risks, although the rapid development and fluidity of the situation precludes any specific prediction as to its ultimate impact on the Company. However, if the pandemic continues to spread or otherwise results in a continuation or worsening of the current economic and commercial environments, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Lending Activities\nThe Company\u2019s ACL may prove to be insufficient to absorb credit losses in its loan portfolio.\nLike all financial institutions, the Company maintains an ACL to provide for loans that its borrowers may not repay in their entirety. The Company believes that it maintains an ACL at a level adequate to absorb expected losses in the loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date and in compliance with applicable accounting and regulatory guidance. The ACL, however, may not be sufficient to cover expected loan losses and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results. Accounting related to the ACL requires significant estimates that are subject to uncertainty and changes relating to new information and changing circumstances. The significant uncertainties surrounding the ability of the Company\u2019s borrowers to execute their business models successfully through changing economic environments, competitive challenges, and other factors complicate the Company\u2019s estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan. Due to the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change, the actual losses may vary from current estimates. The Company expects possible fluctuations in the loan loss provisions due to changes in economic conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s banking regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the ACL and may require the Company to increase its ACL by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense, or to decrease the ACL by recognizing loan charge-offs, net of recoveries. Any such required additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the measure of the Company\u2019s ACL is dependent on the interpretation of accounting standards. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASC 326, which replaces the incurred loss credit impairment methodology with the CECL methodology. The CECL methodology reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. Accordingly, the implementation of the CECL model changed the Company\u2019s current method of providing ACL and resulted in material changes in the Company\u2019s accounting for credit losses on financial instruments. The CECL model may create more volatility in the Company\u2019s level of ACL, which if the Company is required to materially increase its level of ACL for any reason, such increase could adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations. Refer to Note 1 \u201cSummary of\nSignificant Accounting Policies\u201d in the \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d contained in Item 8 \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K for information regarding the Company\u2019s accounting policy and summary of adoption implications of ASC 326.\nThe Bank\u2019s concentration in loans secured by real estate may adversely affect earnings due to changes in the real estate markets.\nThe Bank offers a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer, equipment financing, and other loans. Many of the Bank\u2019s loans are secured by real estate (both residential and commercial). A major change in the real estate markets or in the local or national economy, resulting in deterioration in the value of this collateral or rental or occupancy rates, could adversely affect borrowers\u2019 ability to pay these loans, which in turn could negatively affect the Bank. The Bank tries to limit its exposure to these risks by monitoring extensions of credit carefully; however, risks of loan defaults and foreclosures are unavoidable in the banking industry. As the Bank cannot fully eliminate credit risk; credit losses will occur in the future. Additionally, changes in the real estate market also affect the value of foreclosed assets, and therefore, additional losses may occur when management determines it is appropriate to sell the assets.\nThe Bank has significant credit exposure in commercial real estate, and loans with this type of collateral are viewed as having more risk of default.\nThe Bank\u2019s commercial real estate portfolio consists primarily of non-owner-operated properties and other commercial properties. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans. They are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans and depend on cash flows from the owner\u2019s business or the property\u2019s tenants to service the debt. Cash flows may be affected significantly by general economic conditions, and a downturn in the local economy or in occupancy rates in the local economy where the property is located could increase the likelihood of default. The Bank\u2019s loan portfolio contains a number of commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, and thus the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in the percentage of non-performing loans. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank\u2019s banking regulators generally give commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement enhanced risk management practices, which could have a material adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s results of operations. Such practices include underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies, more granular reporting and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures.\nThe Bank\u2019s loan portfolio contains construction and development loans, and a decline in real estate values or economic conditions could adversely affect the value of the collateral securing the loans and have an adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s financial condition.\nConstruction and development loans are generally viewed as having more risk than residential real estate loans because repayment is often dependent on completion of the project and the subsequent financing of the completed project as a commercial real estate or residential real estate loan and, in some instances, on the rent or sale of the underlying project.\nAlthough the Bank\u2019s construction and development loans are primarily secured by real estate, the Bank believes that, in the case of the majority of these loans, the real estate collateral by itself may not be a sufficient source for repayment of the loan if real estate values decline. If the Bank is required to liquidate the collateral securing a construction and development loan to satisfy the debt, its earnings and capital may be adversely affected. A period of reduced real estate values may continue for some time, resulting in potential adverse effects on the Bank\u2019s earnings and capital.\nThe Bank\u2019s commercial and industrial loans have contributed significantly to the Bank\u2019s loan growth. A weakening of economic conditions could adversely affect the collectability of the loans and underlying collateral.\nCommercial and industrial loans are generally made to support the Bank\u2019s borrowers\u2019 need for short-term or seasonal cash flow and equipment/vehicle purchases. These loans are typically based on the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay the loans from the cash flow of their businesses. The assets securing these loans may depreciate over time or can be difficult to\nappraise and liquidate, and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. This type of collateral may not yield substantial recovery in the event a default occurs and the Bank needs to liquidate the business.\nLoans that the Bank has made through federal programs are dependent on the federal government\u2019s continuation and support of these programs and on the Bank\u2019s compliance with program requirements.\nThe Bank participates in various U.S. government agency loan guarantee programs, including programs operated by the SBA. If the Bank fails to follow any applicable regulations, guidelines or policies associated with a particular guarantee program, any loans the Bank originates as part of that program may lose the associated guarantee, exposing the Bank to credit risk it would not otherwise be exposed to or have underwritten, or result in the Bank\u2019s inability to continue originating loans under such programs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFederal and state governments have enacted laws and implemented programs intending to stimulate the economy in light of the business and market disruptions related to COVID-19, including the PPP. The Bank participated as a lender in both rounds of the PPP, providing $1.7 billion in loans to over 11,000 customers. The PPP loans are fully guaranteed as to payment of principal and interest by the SBA and the Bank believes that the majority of these loans will be forgiven. However, there can be no assurance that the borrowers will use or have used the funds appropriately or will have satisfied the staffing or payment requirements to qualify for forgiveness in whole or in part. Any portion of the loan that is not forgiven must be repaid by the borrower. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded or serviced by the Bank, which may or may not be related to an ambiguity in the laws, rules or guidance regarding operation of the PPP, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if the Bank has already been paid under the guaranty, seek recovery from the Bank of any loss related to the deficiency. Several large banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP. The Bank may be exposed to the risk of litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached the Bank regarding PPP loans and the Bank\u2019s PPP processes. If any such litigation is filed against the Bank and is not resolved in a manner favorable to the Bank, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the Bank\u2019s reputation. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank relies upon independent appraisals to determine the value of the real estate which secures a significant portion of its loans, and the values indicated by such appraisals may not be realizable if the Bank is forced to foreclose upon such loans.\nA significant portion of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio consists of loans secured by real estate. The Bank relies upon independent appraisers to estimate the value of such real estate. Appraisals are only estimates of value and the independent appraisers may make mistakes of fact or judgment that adversely affect the reliability of their appraisals. In addition, events occurring after the initial appraisal may cause the value of the real estate to increase or decrease. As a result of any of these factors, the real estate securing some of the Bank\u2019s loans may be more or less valuable than anticipated at the time the loans were made. If a default occurs on a loan secured by real estate that is less valuable than originally estimated as evidenced by an updated appraisal, the Bank may not be able to recover the outstanding balance of the loan.\nThe Company\u2019s credit standards and its on-going credit assessment processes might not protect it from significant credit losses.\nThe Company assumes credit risk by virtue of making loans and extending loan commitments and letters of credit. The Company manages credit risk through a program of underwriting standards, heightened review of certain credit decisions, and a continuous quality assessment process of credit already extended. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards that emphasize local lending while avoiding highly leveraged transactions and excessive industry and other concentrations. The Company\u2019s credit administration function employs risk management techniques to help ensure that problem loans are promptly identified. While these procedures are designed to provide the Company with the information needed to implement policy adjustments where necessary and to take appropriate corrective actions, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding undue credit risk.\nThe Company\u2019s focus on lending to small to mid-sized community-based businesses may increase its credit risk.\nMost of the Company\u2019s commercial business and commercial real estate loans are made to small business or middle market customers. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. If general economic conditions in the market areas in which the Company operates negatively impact this important customer sector, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Moreover, a portion of these loans have been made by the Company in recent years, and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. Any deterioration of the borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s nonperforming assets adversely affect its net income in various ways. The Company does not record interest income on nonaccrual loans, which adversely affects its income and increases loan administration costs. When the Company receives collateral through foreclosures and similar proceedings, it is required to mark the related loan to the then fair market value of the collateral less estimated selling costs, which may result in a loss. An increase in the level of nonperforming assets also increases the Company\u2019s risk profile and may affect the minimum capital levels regulators believe are appropriate for the Company in light of such risks. The Company utilizes various techniques such as workouts, restructurings, and loan sales to manage problem assets. Increases in or negative adjustments in the value of these problem assets, the underlying collateral, or in the borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and staff, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities, including origination of new loans. There can be no assurance that the Company will avoid further increases in nonperforming assets in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s mortgage revenue is cyclical and is sensitive to the level of interest rates, changes in economic conditions, decreased economic activity, and slowdowns in the housing market, any of which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s profits.\nAs a result of the acquisition of Access, the Bank now operates a mortgage business as a division of the Bank under the Atlantic Union Bank Home Loans Division brand. The Atlantic Union Bank Home Loans Division business lends to borrowers nationwide. The success of the Company\u2019s mortgage business is dependent upon its ability to originate loans and sell them to investors, in each case at or near current volumes. Loan production levels are sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates and changes in economic conditions. Loan production levels may suffer if the Company experiences a slowdown in the local housing market or tightening credit conditions. Any sustained period of decreased activity caused by fewer refinancing transactions, higher interest rates, housing price pressure, or loan underwriting restrictions would adversely affect the Company\u2019s mortgage originations and, consequently, could significantly reduce its income from mortgage activities. As a result, these conditions would also adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nDeteriorating economic conditions may also cause home buyers to default on their mortgages. In certain cases, where the Company has originated loans and sold them to investors, the Company may be required to repurchase loans or provide a financial settlement to investors if it is proven that the borrower failed to provide full and accurate information on, or related to, their loan application, if appraisals for such properties have not been acceptable or if the loan was not underwritten in accordance with the loan program specified by the loan investor. In the ordinary course of business, the Company records an indemnification reserve relating to mortgage loans previously sold based on historical statistics and loss rates. If such reserves were insufficient to cover claims from investors, such repurchases or settlements would adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nRisks Related to Market Interest Rates\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s income and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s income and cash flows depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest rates earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities,\nsuch as deposits and borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and the policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental and regulatory agencies. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the prepayment of loans, the fair value of existing assets and liabilities, the purchase of investments, the retention and generation of deposits, the rates received on loans and investment securities, and the rates paid on deposits or other sources of funding. The impact of these changes may be magnified if the Company does not effectively manage the relative sensitivity of its assets and liabilities to changes in market interest rates. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to reflect such interest rate changes in pricing its products is influenced by competitive pressures. Fluctuations in these areas may adversely affect the Company and its shareholders.\nThe Company generally seeks to maintain a neutral position in terms of the volume of assets and liabilities that mature or re-price during any period so that it may reasonably maintain its net interest margin; however, interest rate fluctuations, loan prepayments, loan production, deposit flows, and competitive pressures are constantly changing and influence the ability to maintain a neutral position. Generally, the Company\u2019s earnings will be more sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates depending upon the variance in volume of assets and liabilities that mature and re-price in any period. The extent and duration of the sensitivity will depend on the cumulative variance over time, the velocity and direction of changes in interest rates, shape and slope of the yield curve, and whether the Company is more asset sensitive or liability sensitive. Accordingly, the Company may not be successful in maintaining a neutral position and, as a result, the Company\u2019s net interest margin may be affected.\nThe phasing out and ultimate replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate and changes in the manner of calculating other reference rates may adversely impact the value of loans and other financial instruments the Company holds that are linked to LIBOR or other reference rates in ways that are difficult to predict and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced in July 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Intercontinental Exchange, Inc., the company that administers LIBOR, has stated that it intends to cease the publication of one week and two month LIBOR rates immediately after the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, and the remaining LIBOR rates immediately following the LIBOR publication on June 30, 2023, and will consult on such intentions. Given LIBOR\u2019s extensive use across financial markets, the transition away from LIBOR presents various risks and challenges to financial markets and institutions, including to the Company, and liquidity in the interbank markets on which those LIBOR estimates are based has been declining. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Efforts in the United States to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference rates include a proposal by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the market to transition from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. Whether or not the SOFR attains market acceptance as a LIBOR replacement remains in question and the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. The Company has a significant amount of loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit that may be adversely affected by the discontinuation of LIBOR and uncertainty regarding its replacement. In addition, uncertainty regarding the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates or other reforms may adversely affect the trading market for securities on which the interest or dividend is determined by reference to LIBOR, including the Company\u2019s outstanding fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes and trust preferred securities. The discontinuation of LIBOR could also result in operational, legal and compliance risks, and if the Company is unable to adequately manage such risks, they could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s reputation and on its business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business, Industry and Markets\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nThe banking industry is directly affected by national, regional, and local economic conditions. Management allocates significant resources to mitigate and respond to risks associated with changing economic conditions, however, such conditions cannot be predicted or controlled. Adverse changes in economic conditions, including a reduction in federal government spending, flatter yield curve, extended low interest rates, or negative changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing, and savings habits, could adversely affect the credit quality of the Company\u2019s loans, and/or the\nCompany\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s financial performance is dependent on the business environment in the markets where the Company operates, in particular, the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services the Company offers. In addition, the Company holds securities which can be significantly affected by various factors, including interest rates and credit ratings assigned by third parties. Rising interest rates or an adverse credit rating on securities held by the Company could result in a reduction of the fair value of its securities portfolio and have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nAdverse changes in economic conditions in Virginia, Maryland, or North Carolina or adverse conditions in an industry on which a local market in which the Company does business relies could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business in a material way.\nThe Company provides full-service banking and other financial services throughout Virginia and in portions of Maryland and North Carolina. The Company\u2019s loan and deposit activities are directly affected by, and the Company\u2019s financial success depends on, economic conditions within the local markets in which the Company does business, as well as conditions in the industries on which those markets are economically dependent. A deterioration in local economic conditions or in the condition of an industry on which a local market relies could adversely affect such factors as unemployment rates, business formations and expansions, housing demand, apartment vacancy rates and real estate values in the local market. This could result in, among other things, a decline in loan demand, a reduction in the number of creditworthy borrowers seeking loans, an increase in loan delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures, an increase in classified and nonaccrual loans, a decrease in the value of loan collateral and a decline in the net worth and liquidity of borrowers and guarantors. Any of these factors could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business in a material way.\nChanges in U.S. trade policies and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, may adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere have been changes and discussions with respect to U.S. trade policies, legislation, treaties and tariffs, including trade policies and tariffs affecting other countries, including China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico and retaliatory tariffs by such countries. Tariffs and retaliatory tariffs have been imposed, and additional tariffs and retaliation tariffs have been proposed. Such tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions on products and materials that our customers import or export could cause the prices of our customers\u2019 products to increase which could reduce demand for such products, or reduce our customer\u2019s margins, and adversely impact their revenues, financial results and ability to service debt; which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, to the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on the Company or on the markets in which the Company operates, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future. It remains unclear what the U.S. administration or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs already imposed, additional tariffs that may be imposed, or international trade agreements and policies. On October 1, 2018, the United States, Canada and Mexico agreed to a new trade deal - the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or the USMCA - to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. While ratified by Mexico and approved by the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, the trade deal is subject to ratification by Canada. The full impact of the USMCA on the Company, its customers and on the economic conditions in the Company\u2019s markets is currently unknown. A trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to negatively impact the Company\u2019s and its customers' costs, demand for the Company\u2019s customers' products, and the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company faces substantial competition that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s growth and/or operating results.\nThe Company operates in a competitive market for financial services and faces intense competition from other financial institutions both in making loans and attracting deposits which can greatly affect pricing for its products and services. The Company\u2019s primary competitors include community, regional, and national banks as well as credit unions and mortgage companies. Many of these financial institutions are significantly larger and have established customer bases, greater financial resources, and higher lending limits. In addition, credit unions are exempt from corporate income taxes, providing a significant competitive pricing advantage compared to banks. Accordingly, some of the Company\u2019s\ncompetitors in its market have the ability to offer products and services that it is unable to offer or to offer such products and services at more competitive rates.\nThe Company\u2019s consumers may increasingly decide not to use the Bank to complete their financial transactions, which would have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operations.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions through alternative methods that have historically involved banks. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts, mutual funds, or general-purpose reloadable prepaid cards. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The Company faces increasing competition from fintech companies, as trends toward digital financial transactions have accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost of deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Operations\nThe Company\u2019s operations may be adversely affected by cyber security risks and cyber-attacks.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company collects and stores confidential and sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees in systems and on networks. The secure processing, maintenance, and use of this information is critical to the Company\u2019s operations and business strategy. In addition, the Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems, such as \"hacking\", \"identity theft\" and \"cyber fraud\", could result in failures or disruptions in the Company\u2019s customer relationship management, the general ledger, deposits, loans, and other systems. The Company has invested in technologies, and continually reviews its controls, processes and practices that are designed to protect its networks, computers, and data, including customer information from damage or unauthorized access. Despite these security measures, the Company\u2019s computer systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to disable or degrade systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate protective measures.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer cyber-attacks or other information security breaches or be impacted by losses from such events in the future. The Company\u2019s risk and exposure to these matters remain heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, current use of internet banking and mobile banking channels, expanded operations and third-party information systems. Recent instances of attacks specifically targeting financial services businesses indicate that the risk to the Company\u2019s systems remains significant.\nA breach of any kind could compromise systems, and the information stored there could be accessed, damaged, or disclosed. A breach in security or other failure could result in legal claims, regulatory penalties, disruption in operations, remediation expenses, costs associated with customer notification and credit monitoring services, increased insurance premiums, fines and costs associated with civil litigation, loss of customers and business partners, loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products and services, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect its business and financial condition. Furthermore, as cyber threats continue to evolve and increase, the Company may be required to expend significant additional financial and operational resources to modify or enhance its protective measures, or to investigate and remediate any identified information security vulnerabilities.\nThe inability of the Company to successfully manage its growth or to implement its growth strategy may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial conditions.\nThe Company may not be able to successfully implement its growth strategy if it is unable to identify and compete for attractive markets, locations, or opportunities to expand in the future. In addition, the ability to manage growth successfully depends on whether the Company can maintain adequate capital levels, maintain cost controls, effectively manage asset quality, effectively manage increasing regulatory compliance requirements, and successfully integrate any businesses acquired into the organization.\nAs consolidation within the financial services industry continues, the competition for suitable strategic acquisition candidates may increase. The Company will compete with other financial services companies for acquisition and expansion opportunities, and many of those competitors will have greater financial resources than the Company does and may be able to pay more for an acquisition than the Company is able or willing to pay. The Company cannot assure that it will have opportunities to acquire other financial institutions, or that the Company will be able to negotiate, finance, and complete any opportunities available to it.\nIf the Company is unable to effectively implement its strategies for organic growth and strategic acquisitions (if any), the business, results of operations, and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nDifficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with the Company\u2019s own operations may prevent the Company from achieving the expected benefits from acquisitions.\nThe Company may not be able to fully achieve the strategic objectives and operating efficiencies expected in an acquisition. Inherent uncertainties exist in integrating the operations of an acquired entity. In addition, the markets and industries in which the Company and its potential acquisition targets operate are highly competitive. The Company may lose its customers and/or key personnel, or those of acquired entities, as a result of an acquisition. The Company may also not be able to control the incremental increase in noninterest expense arising from an acquisition in a manner that improves its overall operating efficiencies. These factors could contribute to the Company not achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions within desired time frames, if at all. Future business acquisitions (if any) could be material to the Company and it may issue additional shares of common stock to pay for those acquisitions, which would dilute current shareholders\u2019 ownership interests. Acquisitions also could require the Company to use substantial cash, other liquid assets, or to incur debt; the Company could therefore become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures. Further, acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and, therefore, some dilution of the Company\u2019s tangible book value and net income per share of common stock may occur in connection with any future acquisitions.\nThe carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may be adversely affected.\nWhen the Company completes an acquisition, goodwill and other intangible assets are often recorded on the date of acquisition as an asset. Current accounting guidance requires goodwill to be tested for impairment, and the Company performs such impairment analysis at least annually. A significant adverse change in expected future cash flows or sustained adverse change in the Company\u2019s common stock could require the asset to become impaired. If impaired, the Company would incur a charge to earnings that would have a significant impact on the results of operations. The Company\u2019s carrying value of goodwill and net amortizable intangibles were approximately $935.6 million and $57.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2020.\nThe Company\u2019s risk-management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.\nThe Company maintains an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, assess, mitigate, monitor, and report the risks that it faces. These risks include: interest-rate, credit, liquidity, operational, reputation, compliance, and legal. While the Company assesses and improves this program on an ongoing basis, there can be no assurance that its approach and framework for risk management and related controls will effectively mitigate all risk and limit losses in its business. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in the Company\u2019s risk-management program, or if the Company\u2019s controls break down, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to operational, technological, and organizational risk may adversely affect the Company.\nSimilar to other financial institutions, the Company is exposed to many types of operational and technological risks, including reputation, legal, and compliance risks. The Company\u2019s ability to grow and compete is dependent on its ability to build or acquire the necessary operational and technological infrastructure and to manage the cost of that infrastructure while it expands and integrates acquired businesses. Operational risk can manifest itself in many ways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, faulty or disabled computer systems, fraud by employees or persons outside of the Company, and exposure to external events. The Company is dependent on its operational infrastructure to help manage these risks. From time to time, it may need to change or upgrade its technology\ninfrastructure. The Company may experience disruption, and it may face additional exposure to these risks during the course of making such changes. As the Company acquires other financial institutions, it faces additional challenges when integrating different operational platforms. Such integration efforts may be more disruptive to the Company\u2019s business and/or more costly or time-intensive than anticipated.\nThe Company continually encounters technological change which could affect its ability to remain competitive.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company continues to invest in technology and connectivity to automate functions previously performed manually, to facilitate the ability of customers to engage in financial transactions, and otherwise to enhance the customer experience with respect to its products and services. The Company\u2019s continued success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy customer demands and create efficiencies in its operations. A failure to maintain or enhance a competitive position with respect to technology, whether because of a failure to anticipate customer expectations, substantially fewer resources to invest in technological improvements than larger competitors, or because the Company\u2019s technological developments fail to perform as desired or are not rolled out in a timely manner, may cause the Company to lose market share or incur additional expense.\nThe operational functions of business counterparties over which the Company may have limited or no control may experience disruptions that could adversely impact the Company.\nMultiple major U.S. retailers and a major consumer credit reporting agency have experienced data systems incursions in recent years reportedly resulting in the thefts of credit and debit card information, online account information, and other personal and financial data of hundreds of millions of individuals. Retailer incursions affect cards issued and deposit accounts maintained by many banks, including the Bank. Although neither the Company\u2019s nor the Bank\u2019s systems are breached in retailer incursions, such incursions can still cause customers to be dissatisfied with the Bank and otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s reputation. These events can also cause the Bank to reissue a significant number of cards and take other costly steps to avoid significant theft loss to the Bank and its customers. In some cases, the Bank may be required to reimburse customers for the losses they incur. Credit reporting agency intrusions affect the Bank\u2019s customers and can require these customers and the Bank to increase account monitoring and take remedial action to prevent unauthorized account activity or access. Other possible points of intrusion or disruption not within the Company\u2019s nor the Bank\u2019s control include internet service providers, electronic mail portal providers, social media portals, distant-server (\u201ccloud\u201d) service providers, electronic data security providers, telecommunications companies, and smart phone manufacturers.\nThe Company and the Bank rely on other companies to provide key components of their business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of the Company\u2019s (and the Bank\u2019s) business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections, and network access. While the Company has selected these third-party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. Any problem caused by these third parties, such as poor performance of services, failure to provide services, disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, and failure to handle current or higher volumes could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business, and may harm its reputation. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also negatively impact the Company\u2019s operations if those difficulties affect the vendor\u2019s ability to serve the Company. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to the Company\u2019s business operations.\nThe Company depends on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties, and its financial condition could be adversely affected if it relies on misleading information.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or to enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, the Company may rely on information furnished to it by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information, which the Company does not independently verify. The Company also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to clients, the\nCompany may assume that a customer\u2019s audited financial statements conform to GAAP and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the customer. The Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent it relies on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or are materially misleading.\nThe Company\u2019s dependency on its management team and the unexpected loss of any of those personnel could adversely affect operations.\nThe Company is a customer-focused and relationship-driven organization. Future growth is expected to be driven in large part by the relationships maintained with customers. While the Company has assembled an experienced management team, is building the depth of that team, and has management development plans in place, the unexpected loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and may result in lower revenues or greater expenses.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operation and financial condition.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for the Company to provide reliable financial reports, to effectively prevent fraud, and to operate successfully as a public company. If the Company cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, its reputation and operating results would be harmed. As part of the Company\u2019s ongoing monitoring of internal control, it may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal control that require remediation. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe Company has in the past discovered, and may in the future discover, specific areas of its internal controls that need improvement. In addition, the Company continually works to improve the overall operation of its internal controls. The Company cannot, however, be certain that these measures will ensure that it implements and maintains adequate controls over its financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain effective controls or to timely implement any necessary improvement of the Company\u2019s internal and disclosure controls could, among other things, result in losses from fraud or error, harm the Company\u2019s reputation, or cause investors to lose confidence in the Company\u2019s reported financial information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operation and financial condition and the trading price of the Company\u2019s securities.\nLimited availability of financing or inability to raise capital could adversely impact the Company.\nThe amount, type, source, and cost of the Company\u2019s funding directly impacts the ability to grow assets. In addition, the Company could need to raise additional capital in the future to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and business needs, particularly if the Company\u2019s asset quality or earnings were to deteriorate significantly, or if the Company develops an asset concentration that requires the support of additional capital. The ability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, and other sources could become more difficult, more expensive, or altogether unavailable. A number of factors, many of which are outside the Company\u2019s control, could make such financing more difficult, more expensive or unavailable including: the financial condition of the Company at any given time; rate disruptions in the capital markets; the reputation for soundness and security of the financial services industry as a whole; and competition for funding from other banks or similar financial service companies, some of which could be substantially larger or have stronger credit ratings.\nThe Company is a defendant in a variety of litigation and other actions, which may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operation.\nThe Company may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation arising out of its business. The Company\u2019s insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against it, and any claims asserted against it, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm the Company\u2019s reputation. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation exceed the Company\u2019s insurance coverage, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operation for any period. In addition, the Company may not be able to obtain appropriate types\nor levels of insurance in the future, nor may the Company be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms, if at all.\nThe Company may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize its deferred tax assets.\nThe Company has NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes that relate to its deferred tax assets. The Company\u2019s management currently believes that it is more likely than not that the Company will realize its deferred tax assets, based on management\u2019s expectation that the Company will generate taxable income in future years sufficient to absorb substantially all of its NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient taxable income, it may not be able to fully realize its deferred tax assets and would be required to record a valuation allowance against these assets. A valuation allowance would be recorded as income tax expense and would adversely affect the Company\u2019s net income.\nSales of the Company\u2019s common stock in connection with merger or acquisition activity, or other capital transactions may result in an ownership change of control, thus limiting the Company\u2019s ability to realize its deferred tax assets.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to utilize its NOLs is subject to the rules of Section 382 of the Code, which generally restricts the use of NOLs after an \u201cownership change.\u201d An ownership change occurs if, among other things, there is a cumulative increase of more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock ownership by the shareholders (or specified groups of shareholders) who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s common stock or are otherwise treated as 5% shareholders under Section 382 and U.S. Department of Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder because of an increase of these shareholders over a rolling three-year period. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income a corporation may offset with NOL carryforwards. This annual limitation is generally equal to the product of the value of the corporation\u2019s stock on the date of the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate published monthly by the Internal Revenue Service. This annual limitation may be increased for five years after an ownership change by any \u201cbuilt-in gain,\u201d which is the amount of a hypothetical intangible calculated as the value of the corporation less the fair value of tangible assets at the time of the ownership change. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective NOLs.\nAny merger or acquisition activity in which the Company may engage would require it to evaluate whether an ownership change would occur. Given the level of merger and acquisition activity in the Company\u2019s target markets, the Company cannot ensure that its ability to use its NOLs to offset income will not become limited in the future. As a result, the Company could pay taxes earlier and in larger amounts than would be the case if its NOLs were available to reduce its income taxes without restriction. If the utilization of the Company\u2019s NOLs is restricted, it would be required to record a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets, which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s net income.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Regulatory Environment\nThe Company is subject to additional regulation, increased supervision and increased costs compared to some financial institutions because the Company\u2019s assets exceed $10 billion.\nVarious federal banking laws and regulations, including rules adopted by the Federal Reserve pursuant to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act impose additional regulatory requirements on institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $19.6 billion in total assets. As a result, the Company is subject to additional regulatory requirements, increased supervision and increased costs compared to financial institutions with assets of less than $10 billion, including the following: (i) supervision, examination and enforcement by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with respect to consumer financial protection laws; (ii) enhanced supervision as a larger financial institution; (iii) a modified methodology for calculating FDIC insurance assessments and potentially higher assessment rates; and (iv) under the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, is subject to a cap on the interchange fees that may be charged in certain electronic debit and prepaid card transactions.\nIn the Company\u2019s acquisition of Access, the Company acquired the mortgage division of Access National Bank, which before the acquisition operated on a nationwide basis and subject to federal preemption of certain state laws. This mortgage division is now operating as a division of the Bank and, as a result, is not entitled to any such federal\npreemption. The Company and the Bank may incur increased costs in order to comply with state laws that apply to the mortgage division\u2019s nationwide operations.\nThe imposition of these regulatory requirements and increased supervision may require commitment of additional financial resources to regulatory compliance, may increase the Company\u2019s cost of operations, and may otherwise have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the results of the stress testing process may lead the Company to retain additional capital or alter the mix of its capital components as compared to the Company\u2019s current capital management strategy.\nCurrent and proposed regulation addressing consumer privacy and data use and security could increase the Company\u2019s costs and impact its reputation.\nThe Company is subject to a number of laws concerning consumer privacy and data use and security, including information safeguard rules under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These rules require that financial institutions develop, implement, and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution\u2019s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institution\u2019s activities, and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. The United States has experienced a heightened legislative and regulatory focus on privacy and data security, including requiring consumer notification in the event of a data breach. In addition, most states have enacted security breach legislation requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of certain types of security breaches. New regulations in these areas may increase compliance costs, which could negatively impact earnings. In addition, failure to comply with the privacy and data use and security laws and regulations to which the Company is subject, including by reason of inadvertent disclosure of confidential information, could result in fines, sanctions, penalties, or other adverse consequences and loss of consumer confidence, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, overall business, and reputation.\nLegislative or regulatory changes or actions, or significant litigation, could adversely affect the Company or the businesses in which the Company is engaged.\nThe Company is subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision, and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its operations. These regulations affect the Company\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, and growth, among other things. Laws and regulations change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors, the FDIC\u2019s DIF, and the banking system of the whole, rather than shareholders. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies are unpredictable, but may negatively affect the Company or its ability to increase the value of its business. Such changes could include higher capital requirements, increased insurance premiums, increased compliance costs, reductions of noninterest income, limitations on services and products that can be provided, or the increased ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, and policies could result in actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against the Company, which could cause the Company to devote significant time and resources to defend itself and may lead to liability, penalties, reputational damage, or regulatory restrictions that materially adversely affect the Company and its shareholders. Future legislation, regulation, and government policy could affect the banking industry as a whole, including the Company\u2019s business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In addition, the Company\u2019s results of operations also could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.\nThe Company is subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements as a result of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and the Dodd-Frank Act, which could adversely affect its return on equity and otherwise affect its business.\nThe Company and the Bank are each subject to capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital which each must maintain. From time to time, regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. In addition, regulators may require the Company to maintain higher levels of regulatory capital based on the Company\u2019s condition, risk profile, or growth plans or conditions in the banking industry or economy. The capital adequacy standards applicable to the Company and the Bank impose stricter capital requirements and leverage limits than the requirements to which the Company and the Bank were subject in the past.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if the Company were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in the Company having to lengthen the term of its funding, restructure its business models, and/or increase its holdings of liquid assets. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy, and could limit the Company\u2019s ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares. If the Company and the Bank fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and/or other regulatory requirements, the Company\u2019s financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Bank is subject to the CFPB\u2019s broad regulatory and enforcement authority and new regulations, or new approaches to regulation or enforcement by the CFPB could adversely impact the Company.\nThe CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over the Bank and has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of federal consumer financial protection laws. Among other things, the CFPB is authorized to issue rules identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are unfair, deceptive or abusing in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The CFPB has broad discretion to interpret the term \u201cabusive\u201d to cover a wide range of acts or practices. New regulations, or new approaches to regulation or enforcement by the CFPB could adversely impact the Bank\u2019s deposit, consumer lending, mortgage lending, loan collection or overdraft coverage programs and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the USA Patriot Act, OFAC, the Bank Secrecy Act and related FinCEN guidelines and related regulations could have a material impact on the Company.\nBank regulatory agencies routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with the USA Patriot Act, OFAC, the Bank Secrecy Act and related FinCEN guidelines and related regulations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs as required by these obligations to combat terrorist financing, elder abuse, human trafficking, anti-money laundering and other suspicious activity and to fully comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal, financial and reputational consequences for the Company. Such a failure could cause a bank regulatory agency not to approve a merger or acquisition transaction or to prohibit such a transaction even if formal approval is not required. In addition, such a failure could result in a regulatory authority imposing a formal enforcement action or civil money penalty for regulatory violations.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Securities\nThe Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for substantially all of its revenue.\nThe Company is a financial holding company and a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through the Bank and other subsidiaries. As a result, the Company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries, particularly the Bank, for substantially all of its revenues. There are various regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends or make other payments to the Company. Also, the Company\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not be able to service debt, pay obligations, or pay a cash dividend to the holders of its common stock or the holders of its depositary shares, which represent fractional interests in the Company\u2019s Series A preferred stock, and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Further, although the Company has historically paid a cash dividend to the holders of its common stock, holders of the common stock are not entitled to receive dividends, and regulatory or economic factors may cause the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to consider, among other things, the reduction of dividends paid on the Company\u2019s common stock or the Company\u2019s depositary shares even if the Bank continues to pay dividends to the Company.\nAn active trading market in the Company\u2019s common stock may not be sustained.\nThe trading volume in the Company\u2019s common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market may fluctuate. It is possible that an active and liquid trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock will not be sustained, which would make it difficult for you to sell your shares of common stock at an attractive price (or at all). Additionally, shareholders may not be able to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares.\nFuture issuances of the Company\u2019s common stock or preferred stock could adversely affect the market price of the common stock and preferred stock and could be dilutive.\nThe Company is not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock or preferred stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of common stock or preferred stock. Issuances of a substantial number of shares of common stock or preferred stock, or the issuance of depositary shares representing a significant liquidation amount of preferred stock, or the expectation that such issuances might occur, including in connection with acquisitions by the Company, could materially adversely affect the market price of the shares of common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares and could be dilutive to shareholders. Because the Company\u2019s decision to issue equity securities in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors, it cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of possible future equity issuances. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s shareholders bear the risk that future equity issuances will reduce market prices and dilute their stock holdings in the Company.\nCommon stock and preferred stock are equity and are subordinate to the Company\u2019s existing and future indebtedness and effectively subordinated to all the indebtedness and other non- equity claims against the Bank and the Company\u2019s other subsidiaries.\nShares of the Company\u2019s common stock and preferred stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, shares of the common stock and depositary shares, which represent fractional interests in the Company\u2019s Series A preferred stock, will rank junior to all of the Company\u2019s indebtedness and to other non-equity claims against the Company and its assets available to satisfy claims against it, including in the event of the Company\u2019s liquidation. Additionally, holders of the Company\u2019s common stock are subject to prior dividend and liquidation rights of holders of the Company\u2019s depositary shares and other outstanding preferred stock, if any. The Company is permitted to incur additional debt. Upon liquidation, lenders and holders of the Company\u2019s debt securities would receive distributions of the Company\u2019s available assets prior to holders of the Company\u2019s common stock, depositary shares and other outstanding preferred stock, if any. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon any of its subsidiaries\u2019 liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors, including holders of any preferred stock of that subsidiary.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is subordinate to the Company\u2019s existing and future preferred stock.\nThe Company has outstanding Series A preferred stock that is senior to the Company\u2019s common stock and could adversely affect the ability of the Company to declare or pay dividends or distributions on common stock. Under the terms of the Series A preferred stock, the Company is prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock unless all full dividends for the latest dividend period on all outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock have been declared and paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside. Furthermore, if the Company experiences a material deterioration in its financial condition, liquidity, capital, results of operations or risk profile, the Company\u2019s regulators may not permit it to make future payments on its Series A preferred stock, thereby preventing the payment of dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s governing documents and Virginia law contain anti-takeover provisions that could negatively affect its shareholders.\nThe Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and the Virginia Stock Corporation Act contain certain provisions designed to enhance the ability of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to respond to attempts to acquire control of the Company. These provisions and the ability to set the voting rights, preferences, and other terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may discourage takeovers (which certain shareholders may deem to be in their best interest). To the extent that such takeover attempts are discouraged, temporary\nfluctuations in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock resulting from actual or rumored takeover attempts may be inhibited. These provisions also could discourage or make more difficult a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest, even though such transactions may be favorable to the interests of shareholders, and could potentially adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nEconomic conditions may cause volatility in the Company\u2019s common stock value.\nThe value of publicly traded stocks in the financial services sector can be volatile, including due to declining or sustained weak economic conditions, which may make it more difficult for a holder to sell the Company\u2019s common stock when the holder wants and at prices that are attractive. However, even in a stable economic environment the value of the Company\u2019s common stock can be affected by a variety of factors such as expected results of operations, actual results of operations, actions taken by shareholders, news or expectations based on the performance of others in the financial services industry, and expected impacts of a changing regulatory environment. These factors not only impact the value of the Company\u2019s common stock but could also affect the liquidity of the stock given the Company\u2019s size, geographical footprint, and industry.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject the Company to additional risk.\nFrom time to time, the Company may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, the Company may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business and/or a new product or service. Furthermore, strategic planning remains important as the Company adopts innovative products, services, and processes in response to the evolving demands for financial services and the entrance of new competitors, such as out-of-market banks and financial technology firms. Any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s system of internal controls, so the Company must responsibly innovate in a manner that is consistent with sound risk management and is aligned with the Bank\u2019s overall business strategies. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and/or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNegative perception of the Company through social media may adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation and business.\nThe Company\u2019s reputation is critical to the success of its business. The Company believes that its brand image has been well received by customers, reflecting the fact that the brand image, like the Company\u2019s business, is based in part on trust and confidence. The Company\u2019s reputation and brand image could be negatively affected by rapid and widespread distribution of publicity through social media channels. The Company\u2019s reputation could also be affected by the Company\u2019s association with clients affected negatively through social media distribution, or other third parties, or by circumstances outside of the Company\u2019s control. Negative publicity, whether true or untrue, could affect the Company\u2019s ability to attract or retain customers, or cause the Company to incur additional liabilities or costs, or result in additional regulatory scrutiny.\nChanges in accounting standards could impact reported earnings.\nThe authorities that promulgate accounting standards, including the FASB, SEC, and other regulatory authorities, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. These changes are difficult to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively to financial statements for prior periods. Such changes could also require the Company to incur additional personnel or technology costs.", "PERMNO": 79747, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "AUB"}
