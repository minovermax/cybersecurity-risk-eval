{"cik": "49728", "company": "IEC ELECTRONICS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nWe depend on a relatively small number of customers, the loss of one or more of whom may negatively affect our operating results.\nA relatively small number of customers are responsible for a significant portion of our net sales. During fiscal 2015 and 2014, our five largest customers accounted for 61% and 52% of net sales, respectively. During the same two years, our single largest customer accounted for 17% and 18% of net sales, respectively. We expect that sales to our largest customer, GE, will decline significantly during fiscal 2016. The percentage of IEC\u2019s sales to its major customers may fluctuate from period to period, and our principal customers may also vary from year to year. Significant reduction in sales to any of our major customers, including GE, or the loss of a major customer, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on the continued growth and financial stability of our customers, including our major customers. Adverse changes in the end markets they serve can reduce demand from our customers in those markets and/or make customers in these end markets more price sensitive. Further, mergers or restructurings among our customers, or their end customers, could increase concentration or reduce total demand as the combined entities reevaluate their business and consolidate their suppliers. Future developments, particularly in those end markets that account for more significant portions of our revenues, could harm our business and our results of operations.\nBecause of this concentration in our customer base, we have significant amounts of trade accounts receivable from some of our customers. If one or more of our customers experiences financial difficulty and is unable to provide timely payment for the services provided, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, consolidation among our customers could intensify this concentration and adversely affect our business. In the event of consolidation among our customers, depending on which organization controls the supply chain function following the consolidation, we may not be retained as a preferred or approved supplier. In addition, product duplication could result in the termination of a product line that we currently support. While there is potential for increasing our position with the combined customer, our revenues could decrease if we are not retained as a continuing supplier. Even if we are retained as a supplier, we may also face the risk of increased pricing pressure from the combined customer because of its increased market share.\nOur operating results may fluctuate from period to period.\nOur annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors may include, but are not necessarily limited to:\n\u2022\nadverse changes in general economic conditions\n\u2022\nnatural disasters that may impede our operations, the operation of our customers\u2019 business, or availability of manufacturing inputs from our suppliers\n\u2022\nthe level and timing of customer orders and the accuracy of customer forecasts\n\u2022\nthe capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and associated fixed costs\n\u2022\nprice competition\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our customers\u2019 products\n\u2022\nbusiness conditions in our customers\u2019 end markets\n\u2022\nour level of experience in manufacturing a particular product\n\u2022\nchanges in the mix of sales to our customers\n\u2022\nvariations in efficiencies achieved in managing inventories and fixed assets\n\u2022\nfluctuations in cost and availability of materials\n\u2022\ntiming of expenditures in anticipation of future orders\n\u2022\nchanges in cost and availability of labor and components\n\u2022\nour effectiveness in managing the high reliability manufacturing process required by our customers\n\u2022\nfailure or external breach of our information technology systems\nThe EMS industry is affected by the United States and global economies, both of which are influenced by world events. An economic slowdown, particularly in the industries we serve, may result in our customers reducing their forecasts or delaying orders. The demand for our services could weaken, which in turn could substantially influence our sales, capacity utilization, margins and financial results. Recent periods in which EMS sales were adversely affected included 2008-2010 when reduced availability of capital to fund existing and emerging technologies forced some firms to contract or to seek strategic alliances and Department of Defense spending reductions resulting from sequestration and a partial government shut-down during 2013.\nThe SEC investigation relating to the Prior Restatement could negatively impact our business, reputation, and financial condition.\nWe previously restated our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012, and the interim fiscal quarters and year to date periods within the year ended September 30, 2012, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, and the fiscal quarter ended December 28, 2012, as reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A for that fiscal quarter (the \u201cPrior Restatement\u201d). As disclosed in prior filings, the staff of the SEC is conducting a formal investigation relating to the Prior Restatement and other matters.\nAs discussed in \u201cNote 18-Litigation,\u201d we have reached a preliminary understanding with the SEC staff regarding a potential settlement. In this regard, we understand that the SEC staff is prepared to recommend that the SEC file a settled administrative enforcement action against us alleging violations of the antifraud, periodic and current reporting, internal controls, and books-and-records provisions of the federal securities laws. As part of the proposed settlement, we would (i) neither admit nor deny the SEC\u2019s findings, (ii) pay a penalty of $200,000, and (iii) agree to cease-and-desist from committing or causing any violations or future violations of those provisions.\nFinal resolution of the SEC investigation with respect to us is subject to mutual agreement on the language of the settlement documentation as well as final approval of the settlement by the SEC staff and, ultimately, the Commissioners of the SEC. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our efforts to resolve the SEC investigation will be successful or that the settlement terms will be as anticipated. We also cannot predict the timing of any settlement or, in the event the proposed settlement is not approved, what the ultimate resolution of the SEC investigation will be with respect to us.\nIf the necessary approvals of the proposed settlement do not occur, it is possible that the SEC could seek any of a broad range of available civil sanctions under the federal securities laws. These include, but are not limited to, injunctive relief, higher monetary penalties, disgorgement, and pre-judgment interest. If this occurs, we may enter into further discussions with the SEC staff to attempt to resolve the investigation on different terms and conditions or may litigate the matter. We cannot predict the timing or terms of any such further discussions and resolution or the outcome of any subsequent litigation. Any such resolution or outcome, however, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, insurance coverage, financial condition, liquidity, and stock price and could cause a default under our arrangements with Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (\u201cM&T Bank\u201d) with respect to which, if M&T Bank chooses to exercise its remedies, we may not be able to obtain replacement financing or continue operations.\nIf the proposed settlement with the SEC is approved based on the expected terms, there are still potential risks we may face. Among other possible adverse impacts:\n\u2022\nThe settlement could affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial disclosures and may raise reputational issues for our business.\n\u2022\nThe settlement could cause our customers, including the government contractors with which we deal, to lose confidence in us or cause issues under our contractual arrangements with those customers, and could make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\n\u2022\nThe settlement could lead the federal government to suspend or debar us from receiving new government prime or subcontracts, if the government determines that, as a result of the settlement, we are not a presently responsible contracting party. The federal government also could require us to operate under special reporting and other compliance measures, which could increase our costs of performance.\n\u2022\nThe settlement could lead to disputes with our directors and officers liability insurance carriers over prior or future reimbursements of legal expenses incurred in connection with the Prior Restatement and related matters (including the SEC investigation).\n\u2022\nThe settlement could lead to and be used against us in future shareholder, governmental, or other actions, notwithstanding the fact that the previously-disclosed consolidated shareholder class action relating to the Prior Restatement was dismissed in its entirety without right to replead. Any such proceedings would, regardless of the outcome, consume a significant amount of our internal resources and result in additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs.\n\u2022\nThe settlement could result in disqualifications from certain statutory protections and exemptions that otherwise would be available to us. We are seeking waivers from certain relevant disqualifications relating to the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements under the federal securities laws as well as the registration exemptions for offerings under Regulation D. There is no assurance, however, that these waivers will be granted by the SEC.\nWe believe that these risks are mitigated by the expected terms of the settlement, including that it will be on a \u201cno admit or deny\u201d basis. Each of these occurrences, however, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and stock price and could cause a default under our arrangements with M&T Bank with respect to\nwhich, if M&T Bank chooses to exercise its remedies, we may not be able to obtain replacement financing or continue operations.\nThe restatement of our fiscal 2014 financial statements could negatively impact our business, reputation, and financial condition.\nAs discussed in \u201cNote 3-2014 Restatements,\u201d we restated our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, and our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended December 27, 2013, March 28, 2014 and June 27, 2014 (the \u201c2014 Restatements\u201d). The 2014 Restatements relate to an error made in the valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets and an error made in the estimation of excess and obsolete inventory reserves at two operating locations, one of which, SCB, has been divested during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.\nThe 2014 Restatements may, among other impacts, affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial disclosures and may raise reputational issues for our business. The restatement process was highly time and resource-intensive and involved a significant amount of attention from management as well as significant legal and accounting costs. Although we have completed the 2014 Restatements, we could be subject to shareholder, governmental, or other actions in connection with the 2014 Restatements or other matters. Any such proceedings would, regardless of the outcome, consume a significant amount of our internal resources and result in additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs. In addition, the 2014 Restatements and related matters could impair our reputation, could cause our customers, including the government contractors with which we deal, to lose confidence in us or cause issues under our contractual arrangements with those customers, and could make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers. Each of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and stock price and could cause a default under our arrangements with M&T Bank with respect to which, if M&T Bank chooses to exercise its remedies, we may not be able to obtain replacement financing or continue operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting, the reputational effects could materially adversely affect our business.\nUnder the provisions of Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended by the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies to perform an evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting (Internal Controls) and to report on our evaluation in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in greater detail in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we identified two material weaknesses in our Internal Controls resulting in the 2014 Restatements. One of these material weaknesses was remediated during fiscal 2015. We also identified another a material weakness during fiscal 2015. If our remediation of the remaining material weaknesses is ineffective, or if in the future we are unable to maintain effective Internal Controls, additional resulting material restatements could occur, regulatory actions could be taken, and a resulting loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements could materially adversely affect the value of our common stock. We have been and may be required to expend substantial funds and resources in order to rectify any deficiencies in our Internal Controls. Further, if lenders lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our operations.\nWe participate in the electronics industry, which historically produces technologically advanced products with short life cycles.\nFactors affecting the electronics industry in general could seriously harm our customers and, as a result, us. These factors may include, but may not be limited to:\n\u2022\nthe inability of our customers to adapt to rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards, which result in short product life cycles\n\u2022\nthe inability of our customers to develop and market their products, some of which are new and untested\n\u2022\nincreased competition among our customers and their competitors, including downward pressure on pricing\n\u2022\nthe potential that our customers\u2019 products may become obsolete, or the failure of our customers\u2019 products to gain anticipated commercial acceptance\n\u2022\nperiods of significantly decreased demand in our customers\u2019 markets\nSince a significant portion of our business is defense-related, reductions or delays in U.S. defense spending may materially adversely affect IEC\u2019s revenues.\nDuring fiscal years 2015 and 2014, our sales to customers serving the military and aerospace industries approximated 38% and 43% of our sales, respectively. Because these products and services are ultimately sold to the U.S. government by our customers, these sales are affected by, among other things, the federal budget process, which is driven by numerous factors\nbeyond our control, including geo-political, macroeconomic and political conditions. The contracts between our direct customers and their government customers are subject to political and budgetary constraints and processes, changes in short-range and long-range strategic plans, the timing of contract awards, the congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes, the government\u2019s ability to terminate contracts for convenience or for default, as well as other risks such as contractor suspension or debarment in the event of certain violations of legal and regulatory requirements.\nWhile we believe that our customers\u2019 programs are well aligned with national defense and other priorities, shifts in domestic and international spending and tax policy, changes in security, defense, and intelligence priorities, the affordability of our products and services, general economic conditions and developments, and other factors may affect a decision to fund or the level of funding for existing or proposed programs. An impasse in federal budget decision-making could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending. For example, as a result of inability of the U.S. Government to reach agreement on budget reduction measures required by the Budget Control Act of 2011, sequestration triggered very substantial automatic spending reductions beginning in January 2013, divided between defense and domestic spending over a nine-year period. As a result, U.S. Government funding for certain of our customers has been and could continue to be reduced, delayed or eliminated, which could significantly impact these customers\u2019 demand for our products and services and if so this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.\nThe accuracy and appropriateness of certain costs and expenses used to substantiate our direct and indirect costs for the U.S. Government contracts are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, an arm of the U.S. DoD. Such audits and reviews could result in adjustments to our contract costs and profitability. However, we cannot ensure the outcome of any future audits and adjustments may be required to reduce net sales or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. If any audit or review were to uncover inaccurate costs or improper activities, we could be subject to penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from conducting future business with the U.S. Government. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected by global economic and financial market conditions.\nCurrent global economic and financial market conditions, including the slow recovery from the global economic recession or the onset of another recession, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These conditions may also materially impact our customers and suppliers. Economic and financial market conditions that adversely affect our customers may cause them to terminate or delay existing purchase orders or to reduce the volume of products they purchase from us in the future. We may be owed significant balances from customers that operate in cyclical industries and under leveraged conditions that could impair their ability to pay amounts owed to IEC on a timely basis. Failure to collect a significant portion of those receivables could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nSimilarly, adverse changes in credit terms extended to us by our suppliers, such as shortening the required payment period for outstanding accounts payable or reducing the maximum amount of trade credit available to us could significantly affect our liquidity and thereby have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and financial market conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes, and our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nThe agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that may constrain the operation of our business, and our failure to comply with these covenants may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe agreements and instruments governing our secured bank credit facility with M&T Bank (\u201cCredit Facility\u201d) and other existing debt contain various covenants that, among other things, require us to comply with certain financial covenants including maintenance of minimum earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and stock compensation expense (\u201cEBITDAS\u201d), limits on the ratio of debt to EBITDAS, and maintenance of a fixed charge coverage ratio, maximum inventory levels and maximum capital expenditures (collectively, \u201cFinancial Covenants\u201d). The agreements and instruments governing the Credit Facility require financial and other reporting, contain limitations on revolving loan borrowings and restrict or limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur debt\n\u2022\nincur or maintain liens\n\u2022\nmake acquisitions of businesses or entities\n\u2022\nmake investments, loans or advances\n\u2022\nenter into guarantee agreements\n\u2022\nengage in mergers, consolidations or certain sales of assets\n\u2022\nengage in transactions with affiliates\n\u2022\npay dividends or engage in stock redemptions or repurchases\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures\nThe Credit Facility is secured by a general security agreement covering the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, a pledge of the Company\u2019s equity interest in its subsidiaries, a negative pledge on the Company\u2019s real property, and a guarantee by the Company\u2019s subsidiaries, all of which restrict use of these assets to support other financial instruments.\nIn connection with the Prior Restatement and the 2014 Restatements described above in \u201cThe Restatement Of Our Financial Statements Could Negatively Impact Our Business, Reputation and Financial Condition \u201d (the \u201cRestatement Risk Factor\u201d), M&T Bank has waived the defaults under the Credit Facility caused by (i) our failure to provide financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, (ii) our non-compliance with Financial Covenants, and (iii) our failure to timely deliver financial statements as further described in Note 9-Credit Facilities to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K/A. M&T Bank also amended the Financial Covenants for measurement periods starting with the fiscal quarter ending June 28, 2013. In connection with each of our 2013 fiscal year end and 2014 first fiscal quarter end, M&T Bank further waived compliance with, and further amended, certain Financial Covenants as described in \u201cNote 9-Credit Facilities\u201d. These waivers and amendments have increased our borrowing costs through covenant waiver fees, other related fees and increased interest rates. To the extent we are required to seek additional waivers and/or amendments, we may continue to experience increased borrowing costs. If the Company is not in compliance with all of our debt covenants, and if M&T Bank chooses to exercise its remedies, M&T Bank could accelerate our primary indebtedness which could cause cross-defaults with respect to other obligations, causing a material adverse effect on our financial condition including, our inability to obtain replacement financing or continue operations. Our ability to comply with covenants contained in our Credit Facility and other existing debt may be affected by matters described in the Restatement Risk Factor as well as events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions.\nStart-up costs and inefficiencies related to new or transferred programs can materially adversely affect our operating results and may not be recoverable.\nOur long term success depends in part upon our ability to support our customers as they bring new products and programs to market, or transfer programs to us. Often these products and programs have technological issues and require, or our customers desire, engineering and other changes and innovations in order to facilitate full-scale production and end-user acceptance. Although some of these programs, particularly in the defense and space industries, once mature, will likely profitably extend over many years and will be difficult to transfer to our competitors, we may have to make significant upfront investments in them that may be recovered only over the longer term. These investments may have a significant impact on our profitability in nearer term periods. Moreover, start-up costs, including the management of labor and equipment resources in connection with establishing new programs and new customer relationships; and difficulties in estimating required resources and the timing of those resources in advance of production, can adversely affect our operating results. If new programs or customer relationships are terminated or delayed, our operating results may be materially adversely affected, particularly in the near term, as we may not recoup those start-up costs or quickly replace anticipated new program revenues.\nSome of our customers may have regulatory issues that adversely affect our operating results.\nSome of our larger customers are in heavily regulated industries, such as health care. If they encounter issues with their regulators related to products we manufacture for them, there may be long delays in resolving those issues or the issues may not be resolved at all, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nMost of the customers in our industry do not commit to long-term production schedules, which can make it difficult for us to schedule production.\nCustomers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production for any number of reasons that are beyond our ability to foresee or control. Although we are always seeking new opportunities, we may not be able to replace any deferred, reduced or cancelled orders. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers could adversely affect our operating results and working capital levels. Such cancellations, reductions or delays have occurred and may occur again. The volume and timing of sales to our customers may vary due to:\n\u2022\nvariation in demand for our customers\u2019 products in their end markets\n\u2022\nactions taken by our customers to manage their inventory\n\u2022\nproduct design changes by our customers\n\u2022\nchanges in our customers\u2019 manufacturing strategy\nDue in part to these factors, most of our customers do not commit to firm, long-term production schedules. Therefore, we make significant judgments based on our estimates of customer requirements, including:\n\u2022\ndeciding on the levels of business that we will seek\n\u2022\nproduction schedules\n\u2022\ncomponent procurement commitments\n\u2022\nequipment requirements\n\u2022\npersonnel needs\n\u2022\nother resource requirements\nThe short-term nature of our customers\u2019 commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate and forecast the future requirements of those customers. Since many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand can adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nIncreased competition may result in decreased demand or reduced prices for our products and services.\nThe EMS industry is highly fragmented and characterized by intense competition. We may be operating at a cost disadvantage compared to larger EMS providers who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers, distributors and raw material suppliers or who have lower cost structures as a result of their geographic location. As a result, other EMS providers may have a competitive advantage. Our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or increase their competition with us. We also expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products or services, to reduce the prices of their products or services and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater performance and improved pricing. Any of these factors may cause a decline in our sales, loss of market acceptance for our products or services, profit margin compression, or loss of market share.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for components that are critical to our manufacturing processes. A shortage of these components or an increase in their price could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nMuch of our net revenue is derived from turn-key manufacturing for which we provide the materials specified by our customers. Some of our customer agreements permit periodic adjustments to pricing based on increases or decreases in component prices and other factors. However, we typically bear the risk of component price increases that occur between any such re-pricing dates or, if such re-pricing is not permitted during the balance of the term of a particular customer agreement. As a result, some component price increases may materially adversely affect our operating results, if we cannot increase prices enough to offset increased costs or if increased prices lead to cancelled orders.\nMany of the products we manufacture require one or more components that are available from a limited number of suppliers. In response to supply shortages, some of these components are from time to time subject to allocation limits. In some cases, supply shortages or delayed deliveries could substantially curtail production of those assemblies requiring a limited-supply component, which could contribute to an increase in our inventory levels, and could delay shipments to customers and the associated revenue of all products using that component. Component shortages have been prevalent in our industry, and such shortages may recur. An increase in economic activity could result in shortages if manufacturers of components do not adequately anticipate increased order volume or if they have excessively reduced their production capabilities. World events, armed conflict, governmental regulation, natural disaster, and epidemics could also affect our supply chain, leading to an inability to obtain sufficient components on a timely basis.\nIn addition, due to the specialized nature of some components and our customers\u2019 product specifications, we may be required to use sole-source suppliers for certain components. Such suppliers may encounter financial or operational difficulties that could cause delays in or the curtailment of component deliveries.\nOur turn-key manufacturing services involve inventory risk.\nOur turn-key manufacturing services described above involve a greater investment in inventory and a corresponding increase in risk as compared to consignment services, for which the customer provides all materials. For example, in our turn-key operations, we must frequently order parts and supplies in minimum lot sizes that may be larger than the quantity of product ultimately needed for our customers. Customers\u2019 cancellation or reduction of orders could result in additional expense to us. If we are not reimbursed for excess inventory ordered to meet customer forecasts, we may accumulate excess inventory and/or incur return charges imposed by suppliers. In addition, component price increases and inventory obsolescence associated with turn-key orders could adversely affect our operating results.\nFurthermore, we provide inventory management programs for some of our customers under which we are required to hold and manage finished goods inventories. Such inventory management programs may lead to higher finished goods inventory levels, reduced inventory turns and increased financial exposure. In cases where customers have contractual obligations to purchase managed inventories from us, we remain subject to the risk of enforcing the obligation.\nProducts we manufacture may contain defects in workmanship, which could result in reduced demand for our services and product liability claims against us.\nWe manufacture highly complex products to our customers\u2019 specifications, often within tight tolerance ranges, and such products may contain design or manufacturing errors or defects. Defects in the products we manufacture, whether caused by customer design, workmanship, component failure or other error, may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or cancelled customer orders, adversely affecting our reputation and may result in product liability claims against us. Even if customers or component suppliers are responsible for the defects, they may be unwilling or unable to assume responsibility for costs associated with product failure.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, harm customer relationships and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nWe have access to, create and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and personally identifiable information of our employees. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be improperly accessed, disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation or our customer relationships, impair our ability to record, process and report accurate information to our stockholders and the SEC, or result in legal claims or proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, revenues and competitive position.\nOur manufacturing processes and services may result in exposure to intellectual property infringement and other claims.\nProviding manufacturing services can expose us to potential claims that products, designs or manufacturing processes we use infringe third party intellectual property rights. Even though many of our manufacturing services contracts generally require our customers to indemnify us for infringement claims relating to their products, including associated product specifications and designs, a particular customer may not, or may not have the resources to, assume responsibility for such claims. In addition, we may be responsible for claims that our manufacturing processes or components used in manufacturing infringe third party intellectual property rights. Infringement claims could subject us to significant liability for damages, potential injunctive action, or hamper our normal operations such as by interfering with the availability of components and, regardless of merits, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In the event of such a claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain and maintain licenses. We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining and maintaining such a license on reasonable terms or at all. Our customers may be required to or decide to discontinue products which are alleged to be infringing rather than face continued costs of defending the infringement claims, and such discontinuance may result in a significant decrease in our business.\nA failure to comply with customer-driven policies and standards, including those related to social responsibility and conflict minerals, could adversely affect our business and reputation.\nIn addition to government regulations and industry standards, our customers may require us to comply with their own social responsibility, conflict minerals, quality or other business policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations as well as our pre-existing policies, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us. Such policies or standards may be customer-driven, established by the industry sectors in which we operate or imposed by third party organizations, such as the SEC\u2019s conflict mineral rules.\nOur compliance with these policies, standards and third party certification requirements could be costly, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our operations, customer relationships, reputation and profitability. In addition, our adoption of these standards could adversely affect our cost competiveness, ability to provide customers with required service levels and ability to attract and retain employees in jurisdictions where these standards vary from prevailing local customs and practices.\nDamage to our manufacturing facilities due to fire, natural disaster, or other events could harm our financial results.\nAt September 30, 2015, we have three manufacturing and assembly facilities. The destruction or closure of any of our facilities for a significant period of time as a result of fire, explosion, blizzard, act of war or terrorism, flood, tornado, earthquake, lightning, other natural disasters, required maintenance or other events could harm us financially, increasing our costs of doing business and limiting our ability to deliver our manufacturing services on a timely basis. Our insurance coverage with respect to damages to our facilities or our customers\u2019 products caused by natural disasters is limited and is subject to deductibles and coverage limits. Such coverage may not be adequate or continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms.\nIf one or more of our facilities is closed on a temporary or permanent basis as a result of a natural disaster, required maintenance or other event, our operations could be significantly disrupted. Such events could delay or prevent product manufacturing and shipment for the time required to transfer production to another facility or to repair, rebuild and/or replace the affected manufacturing facility. This time period could be lengthy and could result in significant expenses for repair and related costs. While we have established disaster recovery plans, such plans may not be sufficient to allow our operations to continue in the event of every natural or man-made disaster, pandemic, required repair or other extraordinary event. Any extended inability to continue our operations at unaffected facilities following such an event would reduce our revenue and potentially damage our reputation as a reliable supplier.\nIf we are unable to maintain satisfactory capacity utilization rates, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nGiven the high fixed costs of our operations, decreases in capacity utilization rates can have a significant effect on our business. Accordingly, our ability to maintain or enhance gross margins continues to depend, in part, on maintaining satisfactory capacity utilization rates. In turn, our ability to maintain satisfactory capacity utilization depends on the demand for our products, the volume of orders we receive, and our ability to offer products that meet our customers\u2019 requirements at competitive prices. If current or future production capacity fails to match current or future customer demands, our facilities would be underutilized, our sales may not fully cover our fixed overhead expenses, and we would be less likely to achieve anticipated gross margins. If forecasts and assumptions used to support the implied fair value of goodwill or realizability of our long-lived assets including intangible assets change, we may incur significant impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as we have experienced.\nIn addition, we generally schedule our production facilities at less than full capacity to retain our ability to respond to unexpected additional quick-turn orders. However, if these orders are not received, we may forego some production and could experience continued excess capacity. If we conclude that we have significant, long-term excess capacity, we may decide to permanently close one or more of our facilities, and lay off some of our employees. Closures or lay-offs could result in our recording restructuring charges such as severance and other exit costs, and asset impairments.\nIf our customers choose to provide manufacturing services in-house or overseas, our results of operations could suffer.\nOur business has benefited from OEMs deciding to outsource their EMS needs to us. Our future revenue growth depends, in part, on new outsourcing opportunities from OEMs. Current and prospective customers continuously evaluate our performance against other providers, including off-shore procurement opportunities. They also evaluate the potential benefits of manufacturing their products themselves. To the extent that outsourcing opportunities are not available either due to OEM decisions to produce these products themselves or to use other domestic or foreign providers, our financial results and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to maintain the engineering, technological and manufacturing capabilities required by our customers in the future.\nThe markets for our manufacturing and engineering services are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process development. The continued success of our business will depend upon our ability to:\n\u2022\nhire and retain qualified engineering and technical personnel\n\u2022\nmaintain and enhance our technological leadership\n\u2022\ndevelop and market manufacturing services that meet changing customer needs\nAlthough we believe that our operations provide the assembly and testing technologies, equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers, there is no certainty that we will develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. The emergence of new technology, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or uncompetitive; or we may have to acquire new assembly and testing technologies and equipment to remain competitive. The acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require significant expense\nor capital investment that could adversely affect our operating results, as could our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers\u2019 changing technological requirements.\nPending arbitration proceedings with our former chief executive officer could negatively impact our results of operations and divert the attention of management.\nWe are currently a party to an arbitration proceeding initiated by W. Barry Gilbert, our former chief executive officer. Mr. Gilbert has alleged that his termination was not for cause as we have claimed and that we breached the terms of our employment agreement with him by not paying the compensation called for under his employment agreement for a termination without cause. Mr. Gilbert is seeking an award of $1.45 million plus attorney\u2019s fees, interest, arbitration costs and other relief alleged to be owed to him under his employment agreement. Although we intend to vigorously defend the Company against Mr. Gilbert\u2019s allegations, the defense may be costly, regardless of the merit of the claims. An adverse decision in these proceedings could negatively impact our results of operations. Moreover, the proceedings may substantially divert the attention of management and our resources in general.\nFailure to attract and retain key personnel and other skilled employees could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur continued success depends to a large extent on our ability to recruit, train, and retain skilled employees, particularly executive management and technical employees. The competition for these individuals is significant; hence the loss of the services of certain of these key employees or an inability to attract or retain qualified employees could negatively impact us.\nFailure to comply with current and future governmental regulations related to defense, health and safety and the environment could impair our operations or cause us to incur significant expense.\nWe are subject to a variety of United States government regulations that control the export and import of defense-related articles and services, as well as federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to employee occupational health and safety, and environmental and waste management regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials used in our manufacturing process. To date, the cost to the Company of such compliance has not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, violations may occur in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes. Further, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of environmental legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed in the future, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, could require substantial expenditures by the Company and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to comply with any present or future regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. While we are not currently aware of any violations, such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment, or to incur other significant compliance-related expenses.\nWe may face heightened liability risks specific to our medical device business as a result of additional healthcare regulatory related compliance requirements and the potential severe consequences that could result from manufacturing defects or malfunctions (e.g., death or serious injury) of the medical devices we manufacture, design or test.\nAs a manufacturer and designer of medical devices for our customers, we have compliance requirements in addition to those relating to other areas of our business. We are required to register with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d) and current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations and to implement design and process manufacturing controls, quality control, labeling, handling and documentation procedures. The FDA, through periodic inspections and product field monitoring, continually reviews and rigorously monitors compliance with these QSR requirements and other applicable regulatory requirements. If any FDA inspection reveals noncompliance, and we do not address the FDA\u2019s concerns to its satisfaction, the FDA may take action against us, including issuing a form noting the FDA\u2019s inspection observations, a notice of violation or a warning letter, imposing fines, bringing an action against the Company and its officers, requiring a recall of the products we manufactured for our customers, issuing an import detention on products entering the U.S. from an offshore facility or temporarily halting operations at or shutting down a manufacturing facility. If any of these were to occur, our reputation and business could suffer.\nIn addition, any defects or malfunctions in medical devices we manufacture or in our manufacturing processes and facilities may result in liability claims against us, expose us to liability to pay for the recall or remanufacture of a product, or otherwise adversely affect product sales or our reputation. The magnitude of such claims could be particularly severe as defects in medical devices could cause severe harm or injuries, including death, to users of these products and others.\nA failure of our information technology systems could materially adversely affect our business.\nA failure or prolonged interruption in our information technology systems, some of which are aging, or difficulties encountered in upgrading our systems or implementing new systems, that compromises our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs, or impairs our ability to record, process and report accurate information could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.", "PERMNO": 78892, "SIC": 3672, "TIC": "IEC"}
