Risk Factors\nReferences in the risk factors to the \u201cCompany\u201d are to MBIA Inc., together with its domestic and international subsidiaries. References to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d and \u201cus\u201d are to MBIA Inc. or the Company, as the context requires. Our risk factors are grouped into categories and are presented in the following order: \u201cInsured Portfolio Loss Related Risk Factors\u201d, \u201cLegal, Regulatory and Other Risk Factors\u201d, \u201cCapital, Liquidity and Market Related Risk Factors\u201d and \u201cMBIA Corp. Risk Factors.\u201d Risk factors are generally listed in order of significance within each category.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nInsured Portfolio Loss Related Risk Factors\nSome of the state, local and territorial governments and finance authorities and other providers of public services, located in the U.S. or abroad, that issued public finance obligations we insured are experiencing fiscal stress that could result in increased credit losses or impairments on those obligations.\nAlthough the financial condition of many state, local and territorial governments and finance authorities that issued the obligations we insured has improved since the financial crisis, some issuers continue to report fiscal stress that has resulted in a significant increase in taxes and/or a reduction in spending or other measures in efforts to satisfy their financial obligations. In particular, certain jurisdictions have significantly underfunded pension liabilities which are placing additional stress on their finances and are particularly challenging to restructure either through negotiation or under Chapter 9 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. If the issuers of the obligations in our public finance portfolio are unable to raise taxes, or increase other revenues, cut spending, reduce liabilities, and/or receive state or federal assistance, we may experience losses or impairments on those obligations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The financial stress experienced by certain municipal issuers could result in the filing of Chapter 9 proceedings in states where municipal issuers are permitted to seek bankruptcy protection. In these proceedings, which remain rare, the resolution of bondholder claims (and by extension, those of bond insurers) may be subject to legal challenge by other creditors.\nThe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and certain of its instrumentalities (\u201cPuerto Rico\u201d) are experiencing fiscal stress and constrained liquidity due to, among other things, Puerto Rico\u2019s structural budget imbalances, no access to the capital markets, a prolonged stagnating local economy, net migration of people out of Puerto Rico and high debt burdens. On June 30, 2016, after passage by the United States Congress, the President of the United States signed into law the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Economic Stability Act (\u201cPROMESA\u201d). PROMESA provides a statutory framework for the creation of an independent oversight board (\u201cthe \u201cOversight Board\u201d) with powers relating to, among other things, the development and implementation of fiscal plans for Puerto Rico, as well as collective action and judicial processes-separate from the Federal Bankruptcy Code-by which Puerto Rico may restructure its debt on a consensual or non-consensual basis.\nIn 2017, the Oversight Board certified and filed in the District Court of Puerto Rico bankruptcy like petitions under Title III of PROMESA for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as well as certain of its instrumentalities, specifically, Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (\u201cCOFINA\u201d), Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (\u201cPREPA\u201d) and Puerto Rico Highway and Transportation Authority (\u201cPRHTA\u201d). On February 4, 2019, the District Court entered an order approving the confirmation of the Plan of Adjustment for COFINA, including the settlement agreement between the Commonwealth and COFINA. The effective date of the Plan was February 12, 2019. While National has entered into a voluntary mediation process with the Oversight Board and Puerto Rico in connection with the GO Bonds and certain other insured Puerto Rico credits, there can be no assurance that National will be able to avoid a non-voluntary outcome in the Title III proceedings which could result in unanticipated losses to National which could be material.\nOn February 15, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit issued its decision on the appeal by Aurelius Investments LLC and other appellants seeking to dismiss the Title III proceedings as unconstitutional. In its decision, the First Circuit agreed with appellants that the process PROMESA provides for the appointment of Board member is unconstitutional under the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause. Notwithstanding that holding, the First Circuit affirmed Judge Swain\u2019s denial of appellants\u2019 motions to dismiss the Title III petitions, concluding that the Board\u2019s constitutional infirmity did not alter or impair the validity of the Board\u2019s past acts, and stayed its mandate for 90 days to allow the President and the Senate to validate the currently defective appointments or reconstitute the Board in accordance with the Appointments Clause. During the 90-day stay, the Board continues to operate as it does currently.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nPuerto Rico continues in its efforts to rebuild its infrastructure and to otherwise recover from the impact of Hurricane Maria in 2017, aided in part by Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal agencies. The extent and duration of such aid is inherently uncertain. In 2018, as part of the Title III proceedings under PROMESA, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico submitted several draft fiscal plans to the Oversight Board, each of which purported to reflect the government\u2019s expected economic outlook for Puerto Rico over a five year period after taking into account, among other factors: (i) the negative impact of Hurricane Maria, (ii) mitigating impact of disaster relief assistance, (iii) changes to revenue and expense measures, and (iv) the impact of structural reforms. On October 23, 2018, the Oversight Board voted to certify the most recent Commonwealth fiscal plan, which reflects a $17.0 billion surplus over a six-year period assuming some levels of debt service. This fiscal plan remains subject to further adjustment, however, and in any event, will ultimately be subjected to a confirmation hearing at which the Court will be asked to approve a Plan of Adjustment addressing distributions for each insured credit. The current plan, or any revisions thereto, can provide no assurance that National will fully recover past amounts paid or future amounts that may be covered under our insurance policies. In addition, the necessary and greater involvement of the federal government, through its actions to deliver disaster relief and other support services, in addition to the evolving role of the Oversight Board and the role of Puerto Rico in its own recovery, heightens political risk in connection with the restructuring of legacy debt. This risk could lead the Oversight Board, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or the federal government to seek to extract greater concessions from creditors based on the uncertainty of Puerto Rico\u2019s long-term recovery prospects. In this event, losses at National on select Puerto Rico exposures could increase materially.\nAs of December 31, 2018, National had $3.3 billion of gross insured par outstanding ($3.8 billion of gross insured par outstanding when including accreted interest on insured capital appreciation bonds) related to Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico may be unable or unwilling to pay their obligations as and when due, in which case National would be required to pay claims of unpaid principal and interest when due under its insurance policies, which could be material. Prior to Puerto Rico filing their Title III bankruptcy proceedings, National paid claims on defaulted Puerto Rico debt in the amount of $197 million. Since that time, Puerto Rico defaulted on scheduled debt service for National insured bonds and National paid gross claims in the aggregate of $494 million through 2018. On January 1, 2019, Puerto Rico also defaulted on scheduled debt service for National insured bonds and National paid gross claims in the aggregate of $65 million. Inclusive of the January 1, 2019 claims, National has paid total gross claims in the aggregate of $756 million related to Puerto Rico. While National will seek to recover any claim payments it makes under its guarantees, there is no assurance that it will be able to do so or in the amounts reflected in its financial statements. To the extent that its claims payments are ultimately substantially greater than its claims recoveries, National would experience losses on those obligations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Refer to the \u201cU.S. Public Finance Insurance Puerto Rico Exposures\u201d section in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for additional information on our Puerto Rico exposures.\nLoss reserve estimates and credit impairments are subject to additional uncertainties and loss reserves may not be adequate to cover potential claims.\nOur insurance companies issued financial guarantee policies that insure the financial performance of the obligations guaranteed over an extended period of time, in some cases over more than 30 years, and which are unconditional and irrevocable. Under substantially all of our policies, we do not have a right to cancel the policy. We do not use actuarial approaches that are customarily used by other types of insurance companies to determine our loss reserves. The establishment of the appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving numerous assumptions, estimates and subjective judgments by management, and therefore, there can be no assurance that future net claims in our insured portfolio will not exceed our loss reserves. If our loss reserves are not adequate to cover actual losses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We use financial models to project future net claims on our insured portfolio, including insured credit derivatives, and to establish loss reserves and estimate impairments and related recoveries. There can be no assurance that the future loss projection and impairments based on these models will ultimately reflect the actual losses and impairment and recovery that we experience. Additionally, small changes in the assumptions underlying these estimates could significantly impact loss expectations. For example, our loss reserves are discounted to a net present value reflecting our general obligation to pay claims over time and not on an accelerated basis. Risk-free rates are used to discount our loss reserves under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., and the yield-to-maturity of each insurer\u2019s investment fixed-income portfolio (excluding cash and cash equivalents and other investments not intended to defease long-term liabilities) as of year-end is used to discount each insurer\u2019s loss reserves under statutory accounting principles. Accordingly, changes in the risk-free rates or the yield in our insurance companies\u2019 fixed-income investment portfolios may materially impact loss reserves.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nPolitical and economic conditions in the United States, the Eurozone and elsewhere may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs a financial guarantee company, our insured exposures and our results of operations can be materially affected by general political and economic conditions, both in the U.S. and around the world. General global unrest, including without limitation the potential exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, as well as fraud, terrorism, catastrophic events, natural disasters, pandemics or similar events could disrupt the economy in the U.S. and other countries where we have insured exposure or operate our businesses. In certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. we face higher risks of governmental intervention through nationalization or expropriation of assets, changes in regulation, an inability to enforce our rights in court or otherwise and corruption, which may cause us to incur losses on the exposures we insure or reputational harm.\nBudget deficits at all levels of government in the U.S., recessions, increases in corporate, municipal, sovereign, sub-sovereign or consumer default rates and other general economic conditions may adversely impact the performance of our insured portfolios and the Company\u2019s investment portfolio. In addition, we are exposed to correlation risk as a result of the possibility that multiple credits will experience losses as a result of any such event or series of events, in particular exposures that are backed by revenues from business and personal travel, such as aircraft securitizations and bonds backed by hotel taxes.\nFinancial modeling involves uncertainty over ultimate outcomes, which makes it difficult to estimate liquidity, potential claims payments, loss reserves and fair values.\nThe Company uses third-party and internal financial models to estimate liquidity, potential claims payments, loss reserves and fair values. We use internal financial models to conduct liquidity stress-scenario testing to ensure that we maintain cash and liquid securities sufficient to meet our payment requirements. These measurements are performed on a legal entity and operating segment basis. We also rely on financial models, generated internally and supplemented by models generated by third parties, to estimate factors relating to the highly complex securities we insure, including future credit performance of the underlying assets, and to evaluate structures, rights and our potential obligations over time. We also use internal models for ongoing insurance portfolio monitoring and to estimate case basis loss reserves and, where applicable, to report our obligations under our contracts at fair value. We may supplement such models with third-party models or use third-party experts to consult with our internal modeling specialists. Both internal and external models are subject to model risk and information risk, and there can be no assurance that the inputs into the models received from third parties will be accurate or that the models themselves are accurate or comprehensive in estimating our liquidity, potential future paid claims, related loss reserves and fair values or that they are similar to methodologies employed by our competitors, counterparties or other market participants. Estimates of our claims payments, in particular, may materially impact our liquidity position. We may make changes to our estimated claims payments, loss reserves or fair value models from time to time. These changes could materially impact our financial results.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not adequately detect or prevent future losses.\nWe assess our risk management policies and procedures on a periodic basis. As a result of such assessment, we may take steps to change our internal risk assessment capabilities and procedures, portfolio management policies, systems and processes and our policies and procedures for monitoring and assessing the performance of our insured portfolio in changing market conditions. There can be no assurance, however, that these steps will be adequate to avoid future losses. In some cases, losses can be substantial, particularly if a loss occurs on a transaction in which we have a large notional exposure or on a transaction structured with large, bullet-type maturities.\nLegal, Regulatory and Other Risk Factors\nRegulatory change could adversely affect our businesses, and regulations limit investors\u2019 ability to affect a takeover or business combination that shareholders might consider in their best interests.\nThe financial guarantee insurance industry has historically been and will continue to be subject to the direct and indirect effects of governmental regulation, including insurance laws, securities laws, tax laws, legal precedents and accounting rules affecting asset-backed and municipal obligations, as well as changes in those laws. Also, the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could expose our insurance companies, their directors or shareholders to fines, the loss of their insurance licenses, and the inability to engage in certain business activity, as the case may be. These laws also limit investors\u2019 ability to affect a takeover or business combination without the approval of our insurance regulators.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nChanges to laws and regulations, or the interpretation thereof could subject our insurance companies to increased loss reserves and capital requirements or more stringent regulation generally, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Finally, changes to accounting standards and regulations may require modifications to our accounting methodology, both prospectively and for prior periods; such changes could have an adverse impact on our reported financial results and/or make it more difficult for investors to understand the economics of our business and may thus influence the types or volume of business that we may choose to pursue.\nOur insurance companies could become subject to regulatory action.\nOur insurance companies are subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions that require them to maintain qualifying investments to support their reserves and required minimum surplus. Furthermore, our insurance companies may be restricted from making commutation or other payments if doing so would cause them to fail to meet such requirements, and the NYSDFS may impose other remedial actions on us as described further below to the extent our insurance companies do not meet such requirements.\nUnder the NYIL, the Superintendent of Financial Services (the \u201cSuperintendent\u201d) may apply for an order directing the rehabilitation or liquidation of a domestic insurance company under certain circumstances, including upon the insolvency of the company, if the company has willfully violated its charter or the NYIL, or if the company is found, after examination, to be in such condition that further transaction of business would be hazardous to its policyholders, creditors or the public. The Superintendent may also suspend an insurer\u2019s license, restrict its license authority, or limit the amount of premiums written in New York if, after a hearing, the Superintendent determines that the insurer\u2019s surplus to policyholders is not adequate in relation to its outstanding liabilities or financial needs. If the Superintendent were to take any such action, it could result in the reduction or elimination of the payment of dividends to MBIA Inc.\nIn addition to the Superintendent\u2019s authority to commence a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding, if the Superintendent finds that the liabilities of MBIA Insurance Corporation exceed its admitted assets, the Superintendent could use its authority under Section 1310 of the NYIL to order MBIA Insurance Corporation to cease making claims payments (a \u201c1310 Order\u201d). Continuing elevated loss payments and delay or failure in realizing expected recoveries as well as certain other factors may materially and adversely affect MBIA Insurance Corporation\u2019s liquidity and its ability to timely meet its insurance obligations, and could cause the NYSDFS to put MBIA Insurance Corporation into a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding, or issue a 1310 Order, if it does not believe MBIA Insurance Corporation will be able to pay expected claims. See Risk Factor \u201cAn MBIA Insurance Corporation rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding could accelerate certain of the Company\u2019s other obligations and have other adverse consequences\u201d under \u201cMBIA Corp. Risk Factors\u201d for the potential impacts of an MBIA Insurance Corporation rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding, or a 1310 Order.\nInterruption in information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, could harm our business.\nWe depend heavily on our information technology and other operational systems and on the integrity and timeliness of data we use to run our businesses. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events or circumstances wholly or partly beyond our control. Further, we face the risk of operational and technology failures by others, including various financial intermediaries, vendors and parties to which we outsource the provision of services or business operations. If this risk is realized, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and other adverse effects on our business.\nDespite our implementation of a variety of security measures, our information technology and other systems could be subject to physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized tampering or other security breaches, resulting in a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data.\nInterruption in information technology and other operational systems, or a failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on such systems, whether due to actions by us or others, could delay or disrupt our ability to do business, harm our reputation, subject us to regulatory sanctions and other claims, lead to a loss of revenues and/or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nPrivate litigation claims could materially adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs further set forth in \u201cNote 20: Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of MBIA Inc. and Subsidiaries in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, the Company and/or its subsidiaries are named as defendants in certain litigations, and in the ordinary course of business, may be a defendant in or party to a new or threatened legal action. Although the Company intends to vigorously defend against any current or future action, there can be no assurance that it will prevail in any such action, and any adverse ultimate outcome could result in a loss and/or have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe Company is dependent on key executives and the loss of any of these executives, or its inability to retain other key personnel, could adversely affect its business.\nThe Company\u2019s success substantially depends upon its ability to attract and retain qualified employees and upon the ability of its senior management and other key employees to implement its business strategy. The Company believes there are only a limited number of available qualified executives in the business lines in which the Company operates. The Company relies substantially upon the services of William C. Fallon, Chief Executive Officer, and other senior executives. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to retain the services of key executives. While the Company has a succession plan for key executives and does not expect the departure of any key executives to have a material adverse effect on its operations, there can be no assurance that the loss of the services of any of these individuals or other key members of the Company\u2019s management team would not adversely affect the implementation of its business strategy.\nAn ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code could have materially adverse tax consequences.\nIn connection with transactions in our shares from time to time, we may in the future experience an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general terms, an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the aggregate ownership of certain stockholders in our stock by more than 50 percentage points over a testing period (generally three years). If an ownership change were to occur, our ability to use certain tax attributes, including certain losses, credits, deductions or tax basis, may be limited. On May 2, 2018, MBIA Inc.\u2019s shareholders ratified an amendment to the Company\u2019s By-Laws, which had been adopted earlier by MBIA Inc.\u2019s Board of Directors. The amendment places restrictions on certain acquisitions of Company stock that otherwise may have increased the likelihood of an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382. The amendment generally prohibits a person from becoming a \u201cSection 382 five-percent shareholder\u201d by acquiring, directly or by attribution, 5% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and will generally restrict existing \u201cSection 382 five-percent shareholders\u201d from increasing their ownership interest under Section 382 by more than one percentage point over their percentage stock ownership immediately prior to the effective date of the amendment or, if lower, their percentage thereafter. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that MBIA Inc. will not undergo an ownership change at a time when these limitations could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nChanges in U.S. federal income tax law could materially adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s net deferred tax asset.\nMBIA Inc. carries a net deferred tax asset whose value is calculated by application of the federal corporate taxation rates in effect at the time of determination. Changes in applicable U.S. tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect our net deferred tax asset. As a result of the Company having established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset in 2017, any adjustment to the Company\u2019s net deferred tax asset, will likely result in a corresponding change to the Company\u2019s valuation allowance, resulting in no impact to the Company\u2019s balance sheet or income statement.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nIneffective internal controls, including internal control over financial reporting, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nWe cannot be certain that we will not identify control deficiencies or material weaknesses in the future. If we fail to remediate a material weakness or fail to otherwise maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, such failure could result in a material misstatement of our annual or quarterly financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and which could cause investors and other users to lose confidence in our financial statements, limit our ability to raise capital and have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, failure to remediate a material weakness or otherwise failing to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation, and could impair our ability to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC, subject us to litigation and regulatory actions and cause us to incur substantial additional costs in future periods relating to the implementation of remedial measures.\nAs of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, we have identified a material weakness in the process used to estimate our loss reserves and recoveries related to residential mortgage-backed securities (\u201cRMBS\u201d) insured by MBIA Insurance Corporation. Remediation of this material weakness is still in process, and although the Company plans to complete this remediation process as quickly as possible, it cannot at this time estimate when the remediation will be completed. This control deficiency did not result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements in this or any prior filed Annual Report on Form 10-K or quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and the Company\u2019s independent auditor has issued an unqualified opinion on the financial statements included in this Form 10-K. See Part II, Item 9A, Controls and Procedures in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the material weakness.\nAny failure or delay in the remediation of the material weakness could result in material misstatements of accounts or disclosures related to our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, insurance loss recoverable, losses and loss adjustment expenses and related financial disclosures in future periods that would result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in avoiding such failure or delay.\nCapital, Liquidity and Market Related Risk Factors\nWe are a holding company and rely to a significant degree on cash flow from our principal operating subsidiary. A disruption in these cash flows or an inability to access third-party capital could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition and ultimately adversely affect liquidity.\nAs a holding company, MBIA Inc. is largely dependent on dividends and payments under our tax sharing agreement from one or more of its operating subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness and operating expenses, among other items. We expect that for the foreseeable future National will be the primary source of dividends and tax sharing agreement payments. National is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions, applicable to insurance companies generally, that limit the amount of cash dividends, loans and advances that it may pay. See \u201cNew York State Dividend Limitations\u201d in Part 1, Item 1 and \u201cNote 14: Insurance Regulations and Dividends\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of MBIA Inc. and Subsidiaries in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of dividends.\nWe may also from time to time seek to raise capital from external sources. The Company\u2019s access to external sources of financing, as well as the cost of such financing would be influenced by various factors, which could include (i) the long-term debt ratings of the Company, (ii) expected dividends from our subsidiaries, (iii) the financial condition and business prospects of our insurance companies and (iv) the perceptions of the financial strength of MBIA Inc. and our insurance companies. There can be no assurance that an inability to obtain adequate capital on favorable terms, or at all, would not adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nConsequently, our inability to maintain access to capital on favorable terms could have an adverse impact on our ability to pay losses and debt obligations, to pay dividends on our capital stock, to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, to pay our operating expenses and to make capital investments in our subsidiaries. In addition, future capital raises for equity or equity-linked securities could result in dilution to the Company\u2019s shareholders. In addition, some securities that the Company could issue, such as preferred stock or securities issued by the Company\u2019s operating subsidiaries may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of its common shares.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nMBIA Inc. has substantial indebtedness, and may incur additional indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition, and/or our ability to obtain financing in the future, react to changes in our business and/or satisfy our obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, MBIA Inc. had $722 million of medium-term note liabilities, $577 million of Senior Notes liabilities and $311 million of investment agreement liabilities. Our substantial indebtedness and other liabilities could have material consequences because:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to obtain additional financing, should such a need arise, which may limit our ability to satisfy obligations with respect to our debt;\n\u2022\na large portion of MBIA Inc.\u2019s financial resources must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to use for other purposes;\n\u2022\nit may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on, and acceleration of, such debt;\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nour ability to refinance debt may be limited or the associated costs may increase;\n\u2022\nour flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions could be limited, and\n\u2022\nwe are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates because a portion of our liabilities are at variable rates of interest or denominated in foreign currencies.\nAdverse developments in the credit markets may materially and adversely affect MBIA Inc.\u2019s ability to post collateral and meet other liquidity needs.\nCurrently, a significant portion of the cash and securities of MBIA Inc. are pledged against investment agreement liabilities, intercompany financing arrangements and derivatives, which limit its ability to raise liquidity through asset sales. If the market value or rating eligibility of the assets which are pledged against MBIA Inc.\u2019s obligations were to decline, we would be required to pledge additional eligible assets in order to meet minimum required collateral amounts against these liabilities. In such an event, we may sell assets, potentially with substantial losses, finance unencumbered assets through intercompany facilities, or use free cash or other assets, although there can be no assurance that these strategies will be available or adequate to meet liquidity requirements.\nThe level of interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\nIncreases in prevailing interest rate levels can adversely affect the value of our investment portfolios and, therefore, our financial condition. In the event that investments must be sold in order to make payments on insured exposures or other liabilities, such investments would likely be sold at discounted prices. Increases in interest rates also adversely affect the values of investments collateralizing our investment agreement liabilities in our corporate operations, which would require the Company to post additional collateral to its counterparties. Additionally, in the insurance operations, increasing interest rates could lead to increased credit stress on transactions in our insured portfolio, while a decline in interest rates could result in larger loss reserves on a present value basis.\nLower interest rates can result in lower net interest income since a substantial amount of assets are now held in cash and cash equivalents given the increased focus on liquidity. Lower interest rates would also adversely impact the value of our interest rate swap contracts in our corporate operations, and would require the Company to post additional collateral to its counterparties.\nFurther, a number of our interest rate swap contracts and financial investments are indexed to LIBOR, and the assets or liabilities related to the insured credit transactions may be indexed to LIBOR, as the applicable reference rate. In July 2017, The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021, it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for LIBOR. This announcement, among other developments, has resulted in uncertainty about the future of LIBOR, and the potential or actual discontinuance of LIBOR as a benchmark rate may adversely affect the value of, return on and trading market for our financial assets and liabilities that are based on or are linked to LIBOR. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we and other market participants will be adequately prepared for an actual discontinuation of LIBOR which could have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics that could also produce an adverse economic impact.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nIn addition, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk in respect of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. In addition to insured liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, some of the remaining liabilities in our corporate segment are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars and the assets of our corporate segment are predominantly denominated in U.S. dollars. Accordingly, the weakening of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies could substantially increase our potential obligations and statutory capital exposure. Conversely, the Company makes investments denominated in a foreign currency and the weakening of the foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar will diminish the value of such non-U.S. dollar denominated asset. Exchange rates have fluctuated significantly in recent periods and may continue to do so in the future, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nMBIA Corp. Risk Factors\nAs described further and for the reasons stated herein, we believe that MBIA Corp. will not provide significant economic or shareholder value to MBIA Inc. For additional information on MBIA Corp., refer to \u201cResults of Operations-International and Structured Finance Insurance\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K. Additionally, also as described further herein, given the separation of MBIA Inc. and MBIA Corp. as distinct legal entities, the absence of any cross defaults between the entities, and the lack of reliance by MBIA Inc. on MBIA Corp. for the receipt of dividends, we do not believe that a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding of MBIA Insurance Corporation by the NYSDFS would have any significant long-term impact on the financial condition or liquidity of MBIA Inc. However, there can be no assurance that the financial condition or a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding of MBIA Insurance Corporation would not have an adverse impact on MBIA Inc. The risk factors described below with respect to MBIA Corp. are set forth for that reason, as well as for an independent understanding of the risks to MBIA Corp.\nContinuing elevated loss payments and delay or failure in realizing expected recoveries on insured transactions may materially and adversely affect MBIA Insurance Corporation\u2019s statutory capital and its ability to meet liquidity needs and could cause the NYSDFS to put MBIA Insurance Corporation into a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding if the NYSDFS concludes that MBIA Insurance Corporation will not be able to pay expected claims.\nMBIA Insurance Corporation is particularly sensitive to the risk that it will not have sufficient capital or liquid resources to meet contractual payment obligations when due or to make settlement payments in order to terminate insured exposures to avoid losses. While management\u2019s expected liquidity and capital forecasts for MBIA Insurance Corporation reflect adequate resources to pay expected claims, there are risks to the capital and liquidity forecasts as MBIA Insurance Corporation\u2019s remaining insured exposures and its expected salvage recoveries are potentially volatile. Such volatility exists in the amount of excess spread and put-back recoverable that MBIA Insurance Corporation may collect, its ability to recover the approximately $919 million in aggregate claims it paid in respect of the insured notes issued by Zohar CDO 2003-1, Limited and Zohar II 2005-1 CDO (collectively, the \u201cZohar Claims Payments\u201d), and the exposure in its remaining insured portfolio, which could deteriorate and result in significant additional loss reserves and claim payments, including claims on insured exposures that in some cases may require large bullet payments.\nMBIA Insurance Corporation has also entered into a financing facility, which is described in more detail under the \u201cLiquidity-MBIA Corp. Liquidity\u201d section in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K (the \u201cFacility\u201d), with affiliates of certain holders of its 14% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Surplus Notes (collectively, the \u201cSenior Lenders\u201d), and with the Company, pursuant to which the Senior Lenders have provided $325 million of senior financing and the Company has provided $38 million of subordinated financing.\nMBIA Insurance Corporation believes that the primary source of funds for the repayment of its obligations under the Facility and for reimbursement for the Zohar Claims Payments will come from the liquidation or refinancing of the loans made to, and equity interests in, companies purportedly controlled by the sponsor and former collateral manager of the Zohar CDOs referenced above (collectively, the \u201cZohar Collateral\u201d).\nWhile MBIA Insurance Corporation believes there will be sufficient recoveries on the Zohar Collateral to both repay amounts due under the Facility and to substantially reimburse it for the Zohar Claims Payments, there is significant uncertainty with respect to the realizable value of the Zohar Collateral. If the amount of recoveries on the Zohar Collateral is not sufficient to repay amounts due under the Facility on or before its maturity date and to reimburse MBIA Insurance Corporation for a substantial portion of the Zohar Claims Payments, MBIA Insurance Corporation would likely incur substantial additional losses, which could materially impair its statutory capital and liquidity.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\nMBIA Insurance Corporation believes that if the NYSDFS concludes at any time that MBIA Insurance Corporation will not be able to satisfy its obligations under the Facility and under its other issued policies, the NYSDFS would likely put MBIA Insurance Corporation into a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding under Article 74 of the NYIL and/or take such other actions as the NYSDFS may deem necessary to protect the interests of MBIA Insurance Corporation\u2019s policyholders. The determination to commence such a proceeding or take other such actions is within the exclusive control of the NYSDFS. The NYSDFS enjoys broad discretion in this regard, and any determination they may make would not be limited to consideration of the matters described above. As noted, however, given the separation of MBIA Inc. and MBIA Corp. as distinct legal entities, the absence of any cross defaults between the entities, and the lack of reliance by MBIA Inc. on MBIA Corp. for the receipt of dividends, we do not believe that a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding of MBIA Insurance Corporation by the NYSDFS would have any significant long-term liquidity impact on MBIA Inc.\nMBIA Corp. insures certain transactions that continue to perform poorly and increased losses or a delay or failure in collecting expected recoveries may materially and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nMBIA Corp. insures certain structured finance transactions that remain volatile and could result in additional losses, which could be substantial. MBIA Corp. has also recorded significant loss reserves on its RMBS, CMBS and CDO exposures, and there can be no assurance that these reserves will be sufficient, in particular if the economy deteriorates. These transactions are also subject to servicer risks, which relates to problems with the transaction\u2019s servicer that could adversely affect performance of the underlying assets. Furthermore, MBIA Corp. has recorded substantial expected recoveries on certain RMBS, and the timing and amount of those recoveries are subject to risk. Any delay or failure in collecting expected recoveries may materially and adversely affect MBIA Corp.\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2018, it recorded expected receipts of $150 million on a pre-VIE elimination basis (on a present value basis) from excess spread (the difference between interest inflows on assets and interest outflows on liabilities) in our RMBS transactions, in reimbursement of our past and future expected claims. Of this amount, $148 million is included in \u201cInsurance loss recoverable\u201d and $2 million is included in \u201cLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves\u201d on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. The amount of excess spread depends on future interest rates and borrower refinancing and defaults. There can be no assurance that this recovery will be received in its entirety or in the expected timeframe. In addition, the Company has recorded a recovery on a transaction containing ineligible loans securitized by Credit Suisse. The Company is pursuing recovery of its losses on this transaction in a litigation in which its assessment of the ineligibility of individual mortgage loans has been challenged by Credit Suisse, and there is no assurance that the Company\u2019s determinations will prevail, or that the Company will be successful in collecting its estimated recoveries in the anticipated timeframe. The litigation may take several years to resolve, during which time we will continue to be required to pay losses on the subject transaction, which may exceed the reserves established for the transaction.\nAn MBIA Insurance Corporation rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding could accelerate certain of the Company\u2019s other obligations and have other adverse consequences.\nAs noted above, MBIA Insurance Corporation continues to face a number of significant risks and contingencies, which could, if realized, result in MBIA Insurance Corporation being placed into a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding by the NYSDFS. In the event of an MBIA Insurance Corporation rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding, the Company may be subject to, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nMTNs issued by GFL, which are insured by MBIA Insurance Corporation, would accelerate. To the extent GFL failed to pay the accelerated amounts under the GFL MTNs, the MTN holders would have policy claims against MBIA Insurance Corporation for scheduled payments of interest and principal;\n\u2022\nAn MBIA Insurance Corporation proceeding may accelerate certain investment agreements issued by MBIA Inc., including, in some cases, with make-whole payments. While the investment agreements are fully collateralized with high quality collateral, the settlements of these amounts could reduce MBIA Inc.\u2019s liquidity resources, and to the extent MBIA Inc. fails to pay the accelerated amounts under these investment agreements or the collateral securing these investment agreements is deemed insufficient to pay the accelerated amounts due, the holders of the investment agreements would have policy claims against MBIA Insurance Corporation;\nItem 1A. Risk Factors (continued)\n\u2022\nThe payment of installment premiums due to National from MBIA Insurance Corporation under the reinsurance agreement between National and MBIA Insurance Corporation (Refer to Item 1, \u201cOur Insurance Operations\u201d, \u201cReinsurance\u201d for a description of the agreement) could be disrupted, delayed or subordinated to the claims of policyholders of MBIA Insurance Corporation;\n\u2022\nCDS and other derivative counterparties may seek to terminate derivative contracts insured by MBIA Insurance Corporation and make market-based damage claims (irrespective of whether actual credit-related losses are expected under the underlying exposure);\n\u2022\nThe rehabilitator or liquidator would replace the Board of Directors of MBIA Insurance Corporation and take control of the operations and assets of MBIA Insurance Corporation, which would result in the Company losing control of MBIA Insurance Corporation and possible changes to MBIA Insurance Corporation\u2019s strategies and management; and\n\u2022\nUnplanned costs on MBIA Inc., as well as significant additional expenses for MBIA Insurance Corporation arising from the appointment of a rehabilitator or liquidator, as receiver, and payment of the fees and expenses of the advisors to such rehabilitator or liquidator.\nRevenues and liquidity would be adversely impacted by a decline in realization of installment premiums.\nDue to the installment nature of a significant percentage of its premium income, MBIA Corp. has an embedded future revenue stream. The amount of installment premiums actually realized by MBIA Corp. could be reduced in the future due to factors such as early termination of insurance contracts, accelerated prepayments of underlying obligations, commutation of existing financial guarantee insurance policies or non-payment. Such a reduction would result in lower revenues and reduced liquidity.", "PERMNO": 75175, "SIC": 6351, "TIC": "MBI"}
