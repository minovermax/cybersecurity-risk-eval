{"cik": "1506492", "company": "CHF Solutions, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business faces many risks. We believe the risks described below are the material risks we face. However, the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional unknown risks or risks that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our shares of common stock could decline significantly. Investors should consider the specific risk factors discussed below, together with the \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other documents that we will file from time to time with the SEC.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have limited history of operations and limited experience in sales and marketing, and we might be unsuccessful in increasing our sales and cannot assure you that we will ever generate substantial revenue or be profitable.\nPrior to our acquisition of the Aquadex Business in August 2016, we did not have a product approved for commercial sale and focused our resources on developing and manufacturing our C-Pulse System. On September 29, 2016, we announced a strategic refocus of our strategy that included halting all clinical evaluations of the C-Pulse System to fully focus our resources on commercializing our Aquadex System, taking actions to reduce our cash burn in connection with such strategic refocus and reviewing potential strategic alliances and financing alternatives. In addition, our business strategy depends in part on our ability to grow our business by establishing an effective sales force and selling our products to hospitals and other healthcare facilities while controlling costs. In addition to heart failure, we have expanded our commercialization efforts into critical care and post-cardiac surgery. In February 2020, we received 510(k) clearance of the Aquadex SmartFlow system to include pediatric patients who weigh 20kg or more. With this 510(k) clearance, we have expanded our commercialization efforts into pediatrics. We have limited prior experience with respect to sales or marketing of the Aquadex System in both heart failure, critical care, post-cardiac surgery and pediatrics. If we are unsuccessful at marketing and selling our Aquadex System, our operations and potential revenues will be materially adversely affected.\nWe have incurred operating losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur operating losses in the near-term. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm issued in connection with its audit of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe are an emerging company with a history of incurring net losses. We have incurred net losses since our inception, including net losses of $18.1 million and $17.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, our accumulated deficit was $217.5 million.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm issued in connection with its audit of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Prior to August 2016, we did not have any products approved for commercialization, generated only limited revenue from our clinical studies and had significant operating losses as we incurred costs associated with the conduct of clinical studies and our research and development programs for our C-Pulse System. We became a revenue generating company only after acquiring the Aquadex Business from a subsidiary of Baxter in August 2016. We expect to incur additional losses in the near-term as we grow the Aquadex Business, including investments in expanding our sales and marketing capabilities, manufacturing components, and complying with the requirements related to being a U.S. public company listed on Nasdaq. To become and remain profitable, we must succeed in expanding the adoption and market acceptance of the Aquadex System. This will require us to succeed in a range of challenging activities, including training personnel at hospitals and effectively and efficiently manufacturing, marketing and distributing the Aquadex System and related components. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in these activities, and we may never generate revenues sufficient to achieve profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it.\nWe believe that we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations into the third quarter of 2020. If additional capital is not available, we will have to delay, reduce or cease operations.\nWe believe that we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations into the third quarter of 2020. Changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate and\ncould adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. Additional financing may not be available when we need it or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us. In addition, the risk that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may make it more difficult to obtain necessary additional funding on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we raise additional funding through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders may suffer dilution and our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future income may be limited. If we raise additional funding through debt financing, we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, require us to use our cash to make payments under such indebtedness, force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios or restrict our ability to pay dividends or make acquisitions. If we are unable to secure additional funding, our development programs and our commercialization efforts would be delayed, reduced or eliminated, our relationships with our suppliers and manufacturers may be harmed, and we may not be able to continue our operations.\nOur near-term prospects are highly dependent on revenues from a single product, the Aquadex System. We face significant challenges in expanding market acceptance of the Aquadex System, which could adversely affect our potential sales.\nOur near-term prospects are highly dependent on revenues from a single product, the Aquadex System, and we have no other commercial products or products in active development at this time. The established market or customer base for our Aquadex System is limited and our success depends on our ability to increase adoption and utilization of the Aquadex System. Acceptance of our product in the marketplace by health care providers is uncertain, and our failure to achieve sufficient market acceptance will significantly limit our ability to generate revenue and be profitable. Market acceptance will require substantial marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant funds by us to inform health care providers of the benefits of using the Aquadex System and to provide further training on its use. We may not be able to build key relationships with health care providers to drive further sales in the United States or sell the Aquadex System outside the United States. Product orders may be cancelled, patients or customers currently using our products may cease to do so and patients or customers expected to begin using our products may not. In addition, market acceptance of the Aquadex System may require that we make enhancements to the system or its components. We cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully develop such enhancements, or that if developed they will be viewed favorable by the market. Our ability to achieve acceptance of our Aquadex System depends on our ability to demonstrate the safety, efficacy, ease-of-use and cost-effectiveness of the system. We may not be able to expand the adoption and market acceptance of the Aquadex System to both the inpatient and outpatient markets and our potential sales could be harmed.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers, the loss of which, or failure of which to order our products in a particular period, could cause our revenues to decline.\nOur ten largest customers represented 45.1% and 54.1% of our revenues in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with our largest customer representing 10.0% and 10.1%, respectively, of our revenues during such periods. Customer ordering patterns may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, or customers may discontinue providing therapies using our products. If one of our largest customers reduced its purchases in a fiscal period, our revenues for that period may be materially adversely affected. Further, if one of our largest customers discontinued the use of our products, our revenues may be materially adversely affected.\nWe have limited commercial manufacturing experience and could experience difficulty in producing commercial volumes of the Aquadex System and related components or may need to depend on third parties for manufacturing.\nWe have limited experience in commercial manufacturing of the Aquadex System. Following the acquisition of the Aquadex Business in 2016, Baxter manufactured and supplied the Aquadex FlexFlow blood circuit sets and Aquadex FlexFlow catheters. We transferred manufacturing equipment for the Aquadex Business to our manufacturing facility in July 2017. We began manufacturing Aquadex FlexFlow consoles and blood circuits in-house in the fourth quarter of 2017 and Aquadex FlexFlow catheters in-house in the third quarter of 2018. We have manufactured the Aquadex SmartFlow console since its development in 2019. However, because we have limited prior commercial manufacturing experience, we may incur manufacturing inefficiencies, delays or interruptions. We may not be able to achieve low-cost manufacturing capabilities and processes that will enable us to manufacture the Aquadex System or related components in significant volumes, while meeting the legal,\nregulatory, quality, price, durability, engineering, design and production standards required to market our products successfully. If we experience difficulties with our manufacturing operations, we may experience delays in providing products and services to our customers, and our business could be harmed.\nWe depend upon third-party suppliers, including single source suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations.\nWe will rely on third-party suppliers, including single source suppliers, to provide us with certain components of the Aquadex System. We have no long-term contracts with third-party suppliers that guarantee volume or the continuation of payment terms. We depend on our suppliers to provide us with materials in a timely manner that meet our quality, quantity and cost requirements. The forecasts of demand we use to determine order quantities and lead times for components purchased from outside suppliers may be incorrect. If we do not increase our sales volumes, which drive our demand for our suppliers\u2019 products, we may not procure volumes sufficient to receive favorable pricing, which could impact our gross margins if we are unable to pass along price differences to our customers. Our failure to obtain required components or subassemblies when needed and at a reasonable cost would adversely affect our business. These suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand. Any difficulties in locating and hiring third-party suppliers, or in the ability of third-party suppliers to supply quantities of our products at the times and in the quantities we need, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe coronavirus outbreak has the potential to cause a disruption in our supply chain.\nThe Covid-19, or coronavirus, outbreak has the potential to cause a disruption in our supply chain. Currently, some of our suppliers of certain components and materials included in the Aquadex System are located in China. It is possible that we could obtain these components or materials from suppliers outside of China. However, such alternative components or materials and/or suppliers would need to be qualified under our supplier quality procedures, which may take significant time and resources. In addition, due to port closures, import delays and other restrictions resulting from the coronavirus outbreak in China, suppliers, located both inside and outside of China, may have limited supply of the components or materials, which could cause the price of such materials to increase. These and other disruptions would likely impact our sales and operating results. If we are unable to obtain the necessary components and materials to manufacture the Aquadex System within our standard lead times, it may delay the production and shipment of the Aquadex System, thereby shifting the timing of recognizing the resulting sale to our customers. In addition, a significant outbreak of contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and impact our operating results.\nIf we cannot develop adequate distribution, customer service and technical support networks, then we may not be able to market and distribute the Aquadex System effectively and our sales will suffer.\nOur strategy requires us to provide a significant amount of customer service, maintenance, and other technical service to our customers. To provide these services, we have begun, and will need to continue, to develop a network of distribution and a staff of employees and independent contractors in each of the areas in which we intend to operate. We cannot assure that we will be able to organize and manage this network on a cost-effective basis. If we cannot effectively organize and manage this network, then it may be difficult for us to distribute our products and to provide competitive service and support to our customers, in which case customers may be unable, or decide not, to order our products and our sales will suffer.\nWe compete against many companies, some of which have longer operating histories, more established products and greater resources than we do, which may prevent us from achieving further market penetration or improving operating results.\nCompetition from medical device companies and medical device divisions of health care companies, pharmaceutical companies and gene- and cell-based therapies is intense and expected to increase. The vast majority of patients with fluid overload receive pharmacological treatment (diuretics) as a standard of care. There are no direct competitors for the Aquadex System in the U.S., other than diuretics. Other systems, such as Baxter\u2019s Prismaflex, a filter-based device that is approved for continuous renal replacement therapy for patients weighing 20kg or more with acute renal failure and/or fluid overload, and Medtronic\u2019s Carpediem, a pediatric dialysis machine that has been approved in the European Union, represent indirect competitors, as they can also be used to conduct ultrafiltration.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to demonstrate the advantages of ultrafiltration as compared to diuretics, a pharmacological treatment that is currently the standard of care. In addition, we need to distinguish Aquadex System from the indirect competition of other devices that can also be used to conduct ultrafiltration.\nThe competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in our industry. If we are unable to retain or hire key personnel, we may not be able to sustain or grow our business.\nOur ability to operate successfully and manage our potential future growth depends significantly upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified research, technical, clinical, regulatory, sales, marketing, managerial and financial personnel. We face intense competition for such personnel, and we may not be able to attract, retain and motivate these individuals. We compete for talent with numerous companies, as well as universities and nonprofit research organizations. Our future success also depends on the personal efforts and abilities of the principal members of our senior management and scientific staff to provide strategic direction, manage our operations and maintain a cohesive and stable environment. We do not maintain life insurance on the lives of any of the members of our senior management. The loss of key personnel for any reason or our inability to hire, retain and motivate additional qualified personnel in the future could prevent us from sustaining or growing our business.\nSignificant additional governmental regulation could subject us to unanticipated delays which would adversely affect our sales.\nOur business strategy depends in part on our ability to expand the use of the Aquadex System in the market as quickly as possible. To achieve expanded market use of the Aquadex System, we may develop additional enhancements to the system or its components. Depending on their nature, such enhancements may be subject to review by the FDA and regulatory authorities outside of the United States under the applicable regulations. Any regulatory delay in our ability to implement enhancements to the Aquadex System or its components could have an adverse effect on our potential sales.\nHealth care laws in the United States and other countries are subject to ongoing changes, including changes to the amount of reimbursement for hospital services. Additional laws and regulations, or changes to existing laws and regulations that are applicable to our business may be enacted or promulgated, and the interpretation, application or enforcement of the existing laws and regulations may change. Legislative proposals can substantially change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers and may negatively impact payment rates for our system. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, applications or enforcements or the specific effects any of these might have on our business. However, in the United States and international markets, we expect that both government and third-party payers will continue to attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care by challenging the prices charged, or deny coverage, for health care products and services. Any future laws, regulations, interpretations, applications or enforcements could delay or prevent regulatory approval or clearance of our Aquadex System and our ability to market our Aquadex System. Moreover, changes that result in our failure to comply with the requirements of applicable laws and regulations could result in the types of enforcement actions by the FDA and/or other agencies as described above, all of which could impair our ability to have manufactured and to sell the affected products.\nIn the United States, the products included in the Aquadex System are purchased primarily by customers, such as hospitals or other health care providers. Customers bill various third-party payers for covered therapies involving the Aquadex System provided to patients. These payers, which include federal health care programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), state health care programs, private health insurance companies and managed care organizations, then reimburse our customers based on established payment formulas that take into account part or all of the cost associated with these devices and the related procedures performed.\nWhile the agency responsible for administering the Medicare program, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has not issued a favorable national coverage determination under its Investigational Device Exception Studies Program for ultrafiltration using the Aquadex System, a number of private insurers have approved reimbursement for the products included in the Aquadex System for specific indications and points of service.\nIn addition, patients and providers may seek insurance coverage on a case-by-case basis. We are exploring the ability to increase the range of coverage for uses of the Aquadex System, such as use in the outpatient setting and use for decompensated heart failure and other indicated uses under its approved labeling, although we may not be successful in doing so.\nProduct defects, resulting in lawsuits for product liability, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, unanticipated use of a product or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of the product can lead to injury or other adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to a product (either voluntary or required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. Any recall of our Aquadex System or any related components could result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products could also result in product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals.\nWe may be held liable if any product we develop or commercialize causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing, sale or consumer use. The safety studies we must perform and the regulatory approvals required to commercialize our products will not protect us from any such liability. We carry product liability insurance with a $6.0 million aggregate limit. However, if there are product liability claims against us, our insurance may be insufficient to cover the expense of defending against such claims, or may be insufficient to pay or settle such claims. Furthermore, we may be unable to obtain adequate product liability insurance coverage for commercial sales of any approved product. If such insurance is insufficient to protect us, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be harmed. If any product liability claim is made against us, our reputation and future sales will be damaged, even if we have adequate insurance coverage. Even if a product liability claim against us is without merit or if we are not found liable for any damages, a product liability claim could result in decreased interest in our registry studies, decreased demand for our system, if approved for commercialization, injury to our reputation, diversion of management\u2019s attention from operating our business, withdrawal of study participants, significant costs of related litigation, loss of revenue or the inability to commercialize our products.\nWe may face significant risks associated with international operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe market our products globally. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including the following: fluctuations in exchange rates of the United States dollar could adversely affect our results of operations, we may face difficulties in enforcing and collecting accounts receivable under some countries\u2019 legal systems, have our products serviced or conduct other operations, political instability could disrupt our operations, some governments and customers may have longer payment cycles, with resulting adverse effects on our cash flow, and some countries could impose additional taxes or restrict the import of our products. In addition, regulations in individual countries or regions may restrict our ability to sell our products. Most countries, including the countries in the European Union (EU), require approval or registration to import and/or sell our products in the country.\nIn the EU, we are required to hold a Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9ene, or CE, Mark to import our product into the EU. To hold the CE Mark, we must demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements of the European Union Medical Devices Directive (93/42/EEC). Recently, the European Union replaced the Medical Devices Directive with the new European Medical Devices Regulation, or MDR. The MDR will apply after a transitional period of three years ending on May 26, 2020. Manufacturers have the duration of the transition period to update their technical documentation and processes to meet the new requirements in order to obtain a CE Mark or to issue a EC Declaration of Conformity. After May 26, 2020, medical devices can still be placed on the market under the provision of the MDD or the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive (\u201cAIMDD\u201d) 90/385/EEC (hereafter referred to together as \u201cMDD/AIMDD\u201d) until May 27, 2024; provided the CE Mark was issued prior to this date, the manufacturer continues to comply with either one of the directives, and that no significant changes are made in the design and intended purpose of the applicable medical device. By May 27, 2024, all medical devices entering the EU will need to have a new CE Mark under the MDR, even if they have been on the market\npreviously under the MDD/AIMDD. We received renewal for the CE Mark for the Aquadex FlexFlow circuit in the second quarter of 2019 and the CE Mark for the Aquadex SmartFlow console in January 2020.\nAny one or more of these factors associated with international operations could increase our costs, reduce our revenues, or disrupt our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to maintain sufficient quality controls, then the approval or clearance of our products by the European Union, the FDA or other relevant authorities could be withdrawn, delayed or denied and our sales will suffer.\nApproval or clearance of our products could be withdrawn, delayed or denied by the European Union, the FDA and the relevant authorities of other countries if our manufacturing facilities do not comply with their respective manufacturing requirements. The European Union imposes requirements on quality control systems of manufacturers, which are inspected and certified on a periodic basis and may be subject to additional unannounced inspections. Failure to comply with these requirements could prevent us from marketing our products in the European Community. The FDA also imposes requirements through quality system requirements, or QSR, regulations, which include requirements for good manufacturing practices, or GMP. Failure to comply with these requirements could prevent us from obtaining FDA approval of our products and from marketing such products in the United States. Our manufacturing facilities have not been inspected and certified by a worldwide testing and certification agency (also referred to as a notified body) that performs conformity assessments to European Union requirements for medical devices. A \u201cnotified body\u201d is a group accredited and monitored by governmental agencies that inspects manufacturing facilities and quality control systems at regular intervals and is authorized to carry out unannounced inspections. We cannot be sure that our facilities or the processes we use will comply or continue to comply with their respective requirements on a timely basis or at all, which could delay or prevent obtaining the approvals we need to market our products in the European Community and the United States.\nTo market our products in the European Community, the United States and other countries, where approved, manufacturers of such products must continue to comply or ensure compliance with the relevant manufacturing requirements. Although we cannot control the manufacturers of our products, if we choose to subcontract manufacturing to a contract manufacturer, we may need to expend time, resources and effort in product manufacturing and quality control to assist with their continued compliance with these requirements. If violations of applicable requirements are noted during periodic inspections of the manufacturing facilities of our manufacturers or we fail to address issues raised by the FDA in these inspections, then we may not be able to continue to market the products manufactured in such facilities and our revenues may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we violate any provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDC Act\u201d) or any other statutes or regulations, then we could be subject to enforcement actions by the FDA or other governmental agencies.\nWe face a significant compliance burden under the FDC Act and other applicable statutes and regulations which govern the testing, labeling, storage, record keeping, distribution, sale, marketing, advertising and promotion of our medically approved products.\nIf we violate the FDC Act or other regulatory requirements at any time during or after the product development and/or approval process, we could be subject to enforcement actions by the FDA or other agencies, including: fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of the production of our products, withdrawal of any existing approvals or pre-market clearances of our products, refusal to approve or clear new applications or notices relating to our products, recommendations that we not be allowed to enter into government contracts and criminal prosecution. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot assure you that our products will be safe or that there will not be serious injuries or product malfunctions. Further, we are required under applicable law to report any circumstances relating to our medically approved products that could result in deaths or serious injuries. These circumstances could trigger recalls, class action lawsuits and other events that could cause us to incur expenses and may also limit our ability to generate revenues from such products.\nWe cannot assure you that our products will prove to be safe or that there will not be serious injuries or product malfunctions, which could trigger recalls, class action lawsuits and other events that could cause us to incur significant expenses, limit our ability to market our products and generate revenues from such products or cause us reputational harm.\nUnder the FDC Act, we are required to submit medical device reports, or MDRs, to the FDA to report device-related deaths, serious injuries and malfunctions of medically approved products that could result in death or serious injury if they were to recur. Depending on their significance, MDRs could trigger events that could cause us to incur expenses and may also limit our ability to generate revenues from such products, such as the following: information contained in the MDRs could trigger FDA regulatory actions such as inspections, recalls and patient/physician notifications; because the reports are publicly available, MDRs could become the basis for private lawsuits, including class actions; and if we fail to submit a required MDR to the FDA, the FDA could take enforcement action against us.\nIf any of these events occur, then we could incur significant expenses and it could become more difficult for us to market and sell our products and to generate revenues from sales. Other countries may impose analogous reporting requirements that could cause us to incur expenses and may also limit our ability to generate revenues from sales of our products.\nWe face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government healthcare reform.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, (the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d) as well as other healthcare reform may have a significant impact on our business. The Affordable Care Act is extremely complex, and, as a result, additional legislation is likely to be considered and enacted over time. The impact of the Affordable Care Act on the health care industry is extensive and includes, among other things, the federal government assuming a larger role in the health care system, expanding healthcare coverage of United States citizens and mandating basic healthcare benefits. The uncertainties regarding the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, including possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act, ongoing legal challenges, and further judicial interpretations, create unpredictability for the health care industry, which itself constitutes a risk.\nThe Affordable Care Act contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of Medicare and Medicaid, including imposing a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers that began in 2013. The medical device excise tax has been suspended in 2018 and 2019 and was repealed effective January 1, 2020.\nThe Affordable Care Act includes a Hospital Readmission Reduction program and is designed to reduce payments to hospitals with excess heart failure readmissions, among other conditions. The penalty to hospitals can be significant, as much as 3% of total Medicare reimbursement. We believe the Aquadex System may offer hospitals an economic benefit for using the device on a regular basis for in-patient or out-patient usage to avoid readmissions for heart failure; however, if the Hospital Readmission Reduction program is repealed, hospitals may not be as inclined to take measures to reduce readmissions.\nIn addition, any healthcare reforms enacted in the future may, like the Affordable Care Act, be phased in over a number of years, but if enacted, could reduce our revenue, increase our costs, or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business or put us at risk for loss of business. In addition, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by changes under the Affordable Care Act and changes under any federal or state legislation adopted in the future.\nMoreover, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act (the Sunshine Act), which was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, requires applicable medical device companies to track and publicly report, with limited exceptions, all payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals in the U.S. Implementing regulations for these tracking and reporting obligations were finalized in 2013, and companies have been required to track\npayments made since August 1, 2013. In 2019, payments to certain nurses, who prescribe treatments, has been added to the list of recipients that companies need to track. If we fail to comply with the data collection and reporting obligations imposed by the Sunshine Act, we may be subject to substantial civil monetary penalties.\nWe are subject, directly or indirectly, to United States federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and false claims laws and regulations. Prosecutions under such laws have increased in recent years and we may become subject to such litigation. If we are unable to, or have not fully complied with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nOur operations are directly, or indirectly through customers, subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Stark law and federal False Claims Act. These laws may impact, among other things, our sales, marketing and education programs.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Several courts have interpreted the statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and, despite a series of narrow safe harbors, prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Penalties for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The physician self-referral laws, commonly referred to as the Stark law, is a strict liability statute that generally prohibits physicians from making referrals for the furnishing of any \u201cdesignated health services,\u201d for which payment may be made under the Medicare or Medicaid programs, to any entity with which the physician (or an immediate family member) has an ownership interest or compensation arrangement, unless an applicable exception applies. Moreover, many states have adopted or are considering adopting similar laws, some of which extend beyond the scope of the Stark law to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the prohibited referral of patients for designated healthcare services and physician self-referrals, regardless of the source of the payment for the patient\u2019s care. If it is determined that any of the relationships we may have with physicians violate the Stark law or similar statutes, we could become subject to civil and criminal penalties. The imposition of any such penalties could harm our business.\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing, or causing to be filed, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The frequency of filing qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of medical device, pharmaceutical and healthcare companies to have to defend a False Claim Act action. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.\nWe are unable to predict whether we could be subject to actions under any of these laws, or the impact of such actions. If we are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government healthcare reimbursement programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in various jurisdictions both domestic and abroad. The FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any\nact or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The U.K. Bribery Act is similar but even broader in scope in that it prohibits bribery of private (non-government) persons as well. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Our distribution arrangements outside of the U.S. presents some risk under these laws. Our distributors may sell to our products to healthcare providers that are owned, controlled or managed by a foreign government and its employees, including healthcare providers may be deemed to be a foreign official under the FCPA. We could be held liable for the actions of our distributors. While we have policies and procedure to address compliance with these laws, we cannot assure you that our distributors will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. Noncompliance with these laws could subject us to investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, adverse media coverage and other consequences. Any investigations, actions or sanctions could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nOur sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year in the future. Our operating results are affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors contributing to these fluctuations include the following:\n\u2022 changes in the prices at which we sell our consoles and disposable blood sets and catheters;\n\u2022 bulk ordering practices by our customers;\n\u2022 general economic uncertainties and political concerns;\n\u2022 introduction of new products, product enhancements and new applications by our competitors;\n\u2022 the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products, product enhancements and new applications;\n\u2022 changes in demand for our Aquadex System;\n\u2022 our ability to grow and maintain sales volumes at a level sufficient to cover fixed manufacturing and operating costs;\n\u2022 the effect of regulatory approvals and changes in domestic and foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 our highly variable sales cycle;\n\u2022 changes in customers\u2019 or potential customers\u2019 budgets as a result of, among other things, reimbursement policies of government programs and private insurers for treatments that use the Aquadex System;\n\u2022 variances in shipment volumes as a result of product, supply chain and training issues; and\n\u2022 increased product costs.\nOur sales volumes from quarter to quarter may fluctuate significantly as a result of such ordering practices. Furthermore, from time to time, we offer our disposable blood sets and disposable catheters at a discount to the list price, and our agreements with certain customers may contain volume or other discounts from our normal selling prices and other special pricing considerations.\nDiscounted pricing can impact our operating results through increasing sales volumes, causing our average selling prices and operating margins to decline and, if we are unable to offset discounts by increasing our sales volume, our net sales could decline. As a result of discounted prices and/or bulk sales orders by our customers, our sales volume may significantly fluctuate quarter to quarter and our sales volume for one quarter may not be indicative of our sales volume for future periods.\nOur expense levels are based, in part, on expected future sales. If sales levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations, we may be unable to adjust operating expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall of sales, and our results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, we have historically made a\nsignificant portion of each quarter\u2019s product shipments near the end of the quarter. If that pattern continues, any delays in shipment could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for such quarter.\nDue to these and other factors, we believe that quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons of our past operating results may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our results for any quarter or year as an indication of our future performance. Our operating results in future quarters and years may be below expectations, which would likely cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nIf we acquire other businesses, products or technologies, we could incur additional impairment charges and will be subject to risks that could hurt our business.\nWe may pursue acquisitions to obtain complementary businesses, products or technologies. Any such acquisition may not produce the revenues, earnings or business synergies that we anticipate and an acquired business, product or technology might not perform as we expect. Our management could spend a significant amount of time, effort and money in identifying, pursuing and completing the acquisition. If we complete an acquisition, we may encounter significant difficulties and incur substantial expenses in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses, products or technologies into our operations. In particular, we may lose the services of key employees and we may make changes in management that impair the acquired business\u2019s relationships with employees, vendors and customers. Additionally, we may acquire development-stage companies that are not yet profitable and which require continued investment, which could decrease our future earnings or increase our futures losses.\nAny of these outcomes could prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits of an acquisition. To pay for an acquisition, we might use stock or cash. Alternatively, we might borrow money from a bank or other lender. If we use stock, our stockholders would experience dilution of their ownership interests. If we use cash or debt financing, our financial liquidity would be reduced.\nAs a result of a potential acquisition, we may be required to capitalize a significant amount of intangibles, including goodwill. We would be required review our definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such assets. In addition, we would be required to evaluate goodwill for impairment annually, or to the extent events or conditions indicate a risk of possible impairment during the interim periods prior to its annual impairment test. In the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized impairment charges of $4.0 million related to goodwill and intangibles assets from our acquisition of the Aquadex Business. If we were required to recognize impairment charges related to future acquisitions, those charges could decrease our future earnings or increase our future losses.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights effectively, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection in the United States and other countries of the intellectual property relating to or incorporated into our Aquadex System and related components. On August 5, 2016, upon closing of our acquisition of the Aquadex Business, we entered into a patent license agreement with Baxter pursuant to which we obtained, for no additional consideration, a world-wide license to 49 exclusively licensed and 9 non-exclusively licensed patents used in connection with the Aquadex System to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import, the Aquadex System in the \u201cfield of use\u201d as defined in the license. The license is exclusive, with respect to some patents, and non-exclusive, with respect to other patents. Under the patent license agreement, Baxter has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to continue maintenance of seven \u201crequired maintenance patents,\u201d and we have agreed to reimburse Baxter for all fees, costs, and expenses (internal or external) incurred by Baxter in connection with such continued maintenance. The rights granted to us under the patent license agreement will automatically revert to Baxter in the event we cease operation of the Aquadex Business or we file for, or have filed against us, or otherwise undertake any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, or other similar proceeding. For two years following the closing, the patent license agreement is not assignable by us (including in connection with a change of control) without Baxter\u2019s prior written consent. We estimate that the patents licensed from Baxter will expire between approximately 2020 and 2025. In December 2018, we filed two patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. One application is based on our design for a wearable device\ndesigned to assist in maintaining peripheral venous blood flow access in the arm during aquapheresis treatment with the Aquadex System. The second application includes multiple potential new features and improvements to the diagnostic capabilities of the Aquadex System, which, if incorporated into the product, would be designed to help patient fluid balance and to improve usability for healthcare providers.\nWe have five pending patent applications. The first application is based on our design for a wearable device designed to assist in maintaining peripheral venous blood flow access in the arm during aquapheresis treatment. The second application includes multiple potential new features and improvements to the diagnostic and ultrafiltration capabilities of the Aquadex System, which, to the extent incorporated into the product, would be designed to help patient fluid balance and to improve usability for healthcare providers. The third application involves a vacuum pump-controlled garment to increase vein diameter and venous flow for peripheral ultrafiltration. The fourth application involves plasma and blood volume measurement during ultrafiltration therapy. The fifth application involves updates to the Aquadex System for use with pediatric patients.\nIn addition, as of February 28, 2020, we owned 36 issued patents and two pending patent applications in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions related to our C-Pulse System and had one pending application for neuromodulation. We estimate that most of our currently issued U.S. patents will expire between approximately 2021 and 2027. Given the strategic refocus away from C-Pulse and towards the Aquadex System, we have chosen to limit the maintenance of issued C-Pulse related patents to those innovations that are of the highest value. Further, we have elected to emphasize a few of the most critical jurisdictions rather than maintain the earlier approach that involved multiple countries.\nOur pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will provide us any financial return. Even if issued, existing or future patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to obtain commercial benefits from them. Changes in patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries could also diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. In addition, the legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. In order to preserve and enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights, we may need to make claims or file lawsuits against third parties. This can entail significant costs to us and divert our management\u2019s attention from our business.\nIntellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to us.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies used in our business. Any claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or require us to pay substantial damages. If we are unsuccessful in defending ourselves against these types of claims, we may be required to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022 halt use of our Aquadex System;\n\u2022 attempt to obtain a license to sell or use the relevant technology or substitute technology, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; or\n\u2022 redesign our system.\nIn the event a claim against us were successful and we could not obtain a license to the relevant technology on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our system to avoid infringement, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be significantly harmed.\nIf we were unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and system could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology, trade secrets, processes and know-how. We generally seek to protect this information by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and third parties. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have\nadequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nOur products could infringe patent rights of others, which may require costly litigation and, if we are not successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages or limit our ability to commercialize our products.\nOur commercial success depends on our ability to increase adoption of the Aquadex System without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. As our industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that there may be patents issued to third parties that relate to our system and technologies of which we are not aware or that we must challenge to continue our operations as currently contemplated. Our system may infringe or may be alleged to infringe these patents.\nIn addition, some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our issued patents or our pending applications or that we were the first to invent the technology. Another party may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering our system or technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications or patents, which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference or derivation proceeding declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful if the other party had independently arrived at the same or similar invention prior to our own invention, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in our industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other medical device companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees, or we, have used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected health information, personally identifiable information, intellectual property and proprietary business information owned or controlled by ourselves or others. At times we may have access to limited amounts of protected health information as part of other healthcare providers\u2019 provision of treatment to patients with our medical devices. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing on-site systems. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business-critical information including research and development information, commercial information, and business and financial information. We face four primary risks relative to protecting this critical information, including: loss of access risk; inappropriate disclosure risk; inappropriate modification risk; and the risk of our being unable to adequately monitor our controls over the first three risks.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance, and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or viruses or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. Any such breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy of personal information and\nregulatory penalties. To the extent that we may engage in activities regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Health Information Technology for Clinical and Economic Health Act (HITECH) we may have additional regulatory and reporting obligations. We are also subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 due to our business in the European Union. Although we believe we have implemented security measures, there is no guarantee we can protect our systems and data from unauthorized access, loss or dissemination that could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to conduct our analyses, conduct research and development activities, collect, process, and prepare company financial information, provide information about our products and other patient and physician education and outreach efforts through our website, manage the administrative aspects of our business, and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health-related, and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory, and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. If so, this could result in government- imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, these privacy regulations may differ from country to country, and may vary based on whether testing is performed in the United States or in the local country. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities.\nStockholders may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations or advance stockholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to effect changes and assert influence on our board of directors and management. Activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction or seek changes in the composition of our board of directors could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A proxy contest would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses and administrative and associated costs and require significant time and attention by our board of directors and management, diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategy. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our board of directors or senior management team arising from a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability which may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives, or limit our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If individuals are ultimately elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our stockholders. We may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of the proxy contest or matters arising from the proxy contest, which would serve as a further distraction to our board of directors and management and would require us to incur significant additional costs. In addition, actions such as those described above could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based upon temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nNasdaq may delist our common stock from its exchange which could limit your ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOn December 17, 2019, we received a letter (the \u201cNotice\u201d) from Nasdaq advising that for 30 consecutive trading days preceding the date of the Notice, the bid price of our common stock had closed below the $1.00 per share minimum required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cMinimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d). The Notice has no effect on the listing of our common stock at this time, and our common stock continues to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cCHFS.\u201d Under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), if during the 180 calendar day period following the date of the Notice (the \u201cCompliance Period\u201d), the closing bid price of our common stock is at or above $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, we will regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and our common stock will continue to be eligible for listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, absent noncompliance with any other requirement for continued listing. If we do not regain compliance with the\nMinimum Bid Price Requirement by the end of the Compliance Period (or the Compliance Period as may be extended) the Company\u2019s common stock will be subject to delisting. We intend to monitor the closing bid price of our common stock and may, if appropriate, consider implementing available options to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement under the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nOn January 2, 2019, we effected a 1-for-14 reverse split of our outstanding common stock. This reverse stock split did not change the par value of our common stock or the number of common or preferred shares authorized by the Company\u2019s Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.\nAdditionally, Nasdaq has the authority, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(l), to delist our common stock if our stockholders' equity falls below $2.5 million. As of December 31, 2019, our stockholders' equity was $2.0 million, which is below Nasdaq's stockholders' equity requirement. Subsequent to year end, on January 28, 2020, we closed on an underwritten public offering for net proceeds of approximately $8.6 million. As of the date of this annual report, we believe that the company has regained compliance with Nasdaq's minimum stockholders' equity requirements as result of our underwritten public offering that was consummated on January 28, 2020. We expect that Nasdaq will continue to monitor the company's ongoing compliance with the stockholders' equity. It is possible that our stockholders\u2019 equity could be reduced again below $2.5 million as a result of operating losses or other reasons. If that occurs, or if we are unable to demonstrate to Nasdaq\u2019s satisfaction that we will be able to sustain compliance with this requirement, Nasdaq may delist our common stock. In addition, even if we regain technical compliance with the stockholders\u2019 equity requirement, we will have to continue to meet other objective and subjective listing requirements to continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We are actively monitoring our stockholders\u2019 equity and will consider any and all options available to us to maintain compliance. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to maintain compliance and meet Nasdaq\u2019s minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirements.\nIf our common stock is delisted, our common stock would likely then trade only in the over-the-counter market. If our common stock were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling our common stock could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; reduced liquidity with respect to our securities; a determination that our shares are a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which will require brokers trading in our securities to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; a reduced amount of news and analyst coverage for our Company; and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock and would substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds and could result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer development opportunities for us.\nIn addition to the foregoing, if our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and it trades on the over-the-counter market, the application of the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and increase the transaction costs to sell those shares. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d as an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. If our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq and it trades on the over-the-counter market at a price of less than $5.00 per share, our common stock would be considered a penny stock. The SEC\u2019s penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and the salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that before a transaction in a penny stock occurs, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s agreement to the transaction. If applicable in the future, these rules may restrict the ability of brokers-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their shares, until our common stock no longer is considered a penny stock.\nThe number of shares of common stock underlying our outstanding warrants and outstanding preferred stock is significant in relation to our currently outstanding common stock. Conversion or exercise of such outstanding convertible securities will cause dilution to holders of our common stock, and could cause downward pressure on the market price for our common stock.\nThe number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our outstanding preferred stock and exercise of outstanding warrants is significant in relation to the number of shares of our common stock currently outstanding.\nAs of February 28, 2020, we have warrants to purchase 24,512,102 shares of common stock outstanding, with exercise prices ranging from $0.55 to $43,848 with a weighted-average exercise price of $2.40.\nAs of February 28, 2020, there were 535 shares of Series F Preferred Stock outstanding, convertible into 973,165 shares of common stock and 1,430,726 shares of Series H Preferred Stock convertible into 1,430,726 shares of common stock. The certificate of designation for our Series F Preferred Stock contains an anti-dilution provision, which provision requires the lowering of the applicable conversion price, as then in effect, to the purchase price per share of common stock or common stock equivalents issued in the future. If the effective price per share on a common-stock equivalent basis in a future equity offering is lower than the then-current conversion price of the Series F Convertible Preferred Stock, then such conversion price shall be reduced to such lower price and additional shares of common stock will be issuable upon the conversion of the of the Series F Convertible Preferred Stock. To the extent the outstanding shares of Series F Convertible Preferred Stock become exercisable for additional shares of common stock, holders of our common stock will experience further dilution.\nIf any security holder determines to sell a substantial number of shares into the market at any given time, there may not be sufficient demand in the market to purchase the shares without a decline in the market price for our common stock. Moreover, continuous sales into the market of a number of shares in excess of the typical trading volume for our common stock could depress the trading market for our common stock over an extended period of time.\nIn addition, the fact that our stockholders, option holders and warrant holders can sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, could make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate, or at all.\nThe rights of holders of our capital stock will be subject to, and could be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of our outstanding preferred stock and stock that may be issued in the future.\nOur board of directors has authority, without further stockholder approval, to issue additional shares of preferred stock with such rights, preferences and privileges as our board may determine. These rights, preferences and privileges may include dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights and liquidation rights that may be greater than the rights of our common stock.\nOur board of directors has previously approved, pursuant to this authority, the issuance of preferred stock, and we have 535 shares of Series F Preferred Stock and 1,430,726 shares of Series H Preferred Stock outstanding as of February 28, 2020. As described therein, upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, holders of our Series F Preferred Stock have the right to receive, out of the assets, whether capital or surplus, of the Company an amount equal to the par value, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, for each share of such preferred stock held by such holder before any distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of our common stock, and, following such payment, such holders are entitled to receive the same amount that a holder of common stock would receive if such preferred stock was fully converted, pari passu with all the holders of common stock.\nOur board of directors may issue additional series of preferred stock. As a result, the rights of holders of our capital stock will be subject to, and could be adversely affected by, the rights of holders of any stock that may be issued in the future.\nWe have a large number of authorized but unissued shares of stock, which could negatively impact a potential investor if they purchased our common stock.\nOn January 2, 2019, we effected a 1-for-14 reverse split of our outstanding common stock. This reverse stock split did not change the par value of our common stock or the number of common or preferred shares authorized\nby the Company\u2019s Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Because the number of authorized shares of our common stock was not reduced proportionately, the reverse stock split increased our board of directors\u2019 ability to issue authorized and unissued shares without further stockholder action. As of February 28, 2020, our certificate of incorporation provides for 100,000,000 shares of authorized common stock and 40,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock, 30,000 of which are designated Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, 535 of which are designated Series F Preferred Stock and 1,430,726 of which are designated Series H Preferred Stock, and we have 20,806,978 shares of common stock outstanding, 27,337,055 shares reserved for issuance upon the conversion, exercise or vesting of outstanding preferred stock, warrants and options, and 148,231 shares of common stock reserved for future grant under the Company\u2019s equity incentive plans.\nWith respect to authorized but unissued and unreserved shares, we could also use such shares to oppose a hostile takeover attempt or delay or prevent changes in control or changes in or removal of management. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and relative voting power and may cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. We could use the shares that are available for future issuance in dilutive equity financing transactions, or to oppose a hostile takeover attempt or delay or prevent changes in control or changes in or removal of management, including transactions that are favored by a majority of the stockholders or in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices or benefit in some other manner.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell the common stock you want or at prices you find attractive.\nThe price of our common stock constantly changes. The price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022 future announcements concerning us, including our clinical and product development strategy, or our competitors;\n\u2022 regulatory developments, disclosure regarding completed, ongoing or future clinical studies and enforcement actions bearing on advertising, marketing or sales;\n\u2022 reports and recommendations of analysts and whether or not we meet the milestones and metrics set forth in such reports;\n\u2022 introduction of new products;\n\u2022 acquisition or loss of significant manufacturers, distributors or suppliers or an inability to obtain sufficient quantities of materials needed to manufacture our system;\n\u2022 quarterly variations in operating results, which we have experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future;\n\u2022 business acquisitions or divestitures;\n\u2022 changes in governmental or third-party reimbursement practices;\n\u2022 fluctuations of investor interest in the medical device sector; and\n\u2022 fluctuations in the economy, world political events or general market conditions.\nIn addition, stock markets in general, and the market for shares of health care stocks in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years, fluctuations that frequently have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline below its current price and the market price of our shares may fluctuate significantly in the future. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate.\nOur loan agreement subjects us to operating restrictions and financial covenants and may restrict our business and financing activities.\nOn August 5, 2016, we entered into a loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank for proceeds of up to $5.0 million, including a $1.0 million revolving line of credit and a $4.0 million term loan. The term loan\nexpired unused on November 30, 2016 and the term loan is no longer available to be drawn. Under the revolving line, we may borrow the lesser of $1 million or 80% of our eligible accounts (subject to customary exclusions), minus the outstanding principal balance of any advances under the revolving line. Advances under the revolving line, if any, will accrue interest at a floating per annum rate equal to 1.75% or 1.0% above the prime rate, depending on liquidity factors. The revolving line of credit expires on March 31, 2020. Advances under the revolving line, if any, are subject to various conditions precedent, including our compliance with financial covenants relating to net liquidity relative to monthly cash burn. We have not made borrowings under the Silicon Valley Bank facility since its inception.\nOur obligations under the loan agreement are secured by a security interest in our assets, excluding intellectual property and certain other exceptions. We are subject to a negative pledge covenant with respect to our intellectual property. The loan agreement contains customary representations, as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. Among other restrictions, the negative covenants, subject to exceptions, prohibit or limit our ability to: declare dividends or redeem or purchase equity interests; incur additional liens; make loans and investments; incur additional indebtedness; engage in mergers, acquisitions, and asset sales; transact with affiliates; undergo a change in control; add or change business locations; and engage in businesses that are not related to its existing business. These covenants may restrict our ability to finance our operations and to pursue our business activities and strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control.\nOur ability to use U.S. net operating loss carryforwards or Australian tax losses might be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had U.S. net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $152.1 million for U.S. income tax purposes. Approximately $120.1 million of NOL carryforwards will expire from 2024 through 2037. Pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the NOL generated in 2018 and 2019 totaling approximately $32.0 million does not expire. To the extent these NOL carryforwards are available, we intend to use them to reduce any corporate income tax liability associated with our operations that we might have in the future. Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of NOL carryforwards that might be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership. During 2017, 2018 and 2019, we believe we experienced an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code which will limit our ability to utilize the our NOLs.\nWe may have experienced additional ownership changes in earlier years further limiting the NOL carryforwards that may be utilized. We have not yet completed a formal Section 382 analysis. As a result, prior or future changes in ownership, could put limitations on the availability of our NOL carryforwards. In addition, our ability to utilize the current NOL carryforwards might be further limited by future issuances of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had tax losses in the Commonwealth of Australia of approximately AU$49.1 million. Continuing utilization of carryforward tax losses in Australia may also be affected by the issuance of our common stock. This is because one test for carrying forward tax losses in Australia from year to year requires continuity of ultimate ownership (subject to the relevant tests in Australian tax law) of more than 50% between the loss year and the income year in which the loss is claimed.\nTo the extent use of our NOL carryforwards or tax losses is limited, our income could be subject to corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use NOL carryforwards and tax losses, which could result in lower profits.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, and we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our products and business. Accordingly, our stockholders will not realize a return on their investments unless the trading price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe will continue to incur increased costs as a result of being a U.S. reporting company.\nIn connection with the effectiveness of our registration statement on Form 10, as of February 14, 2012, we became subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Although we were previously listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and had been required to file financial information and make certain other\nfilings with the Australian Securities Exchange, our status as a U.S. reporting company under the Exchange Act has caused us, and will continue to cause us, to incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not previously incur, including costs related to compliance with the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Capital Market. We expect these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly, and these activities may increase general and administrative expenses and divert management\u2019s time and attention away from revenue-generating activities. Furthermore, now that we are a revenue-generating company following the acquisition of the Aquadex Business in August 2016, our costs to comply with regulations applicable to U.S. reporting companies may further increase. We also expect these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\nInvestors could lose confidence in our financial reports, and the value of our common stock may be adversely affected, if our internal controls over financial reporting are found not to be effective by management or by an independent registered public accounting firm or if we make disclosure of existing or potential material weaknesses in those controls.\nAs long as our public float remains below $75 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, we are exempt from the attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting by our independent auditors pursuant to section 404 (b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 but are required to make our own internal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe continue to evaluate our existing internal controls over financial reporting. During the course of our ongoing evaluation of the internal controls, we may identify areas requiring improvement and may have to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review. Remediating any deficiencies, significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that we or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify may require us to incur significant costs and expend significant time and management resources. We cannot assure you that any of the measures we implement to remedy any such deficiencies will effectively mitigate or remedy such deficiencies. The existence of one or more material weaknesses could affect the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting. It may be more difficult for us to manage our internal control over financial reporting following our acquisition of the Aquadex Business now that we are a revenue generating company. Investors could lose confidence in our financial reports, and the value of our common stock may be harmed, if our internal controls over financial reporting are found not to be effective by management or by our independent registered public accounting firm or if we make disclosure of existing or potential material weaknesses in those controls.\nOur Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision does not preclude or contract the scope of exclusive federal or concurrent jurisdiction for any actions brought under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. Accordingly, our exclusive forum provision will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees.\nIf a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as certain provisions of the DGCL, may delay or deter a change in control transaction.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of deterring takeovers, such as those provisions authorizing our board of directors to issue, from time to time, any series of preferred stock and fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of such series of preferred stock; prohibiting stockholders from acting by written consent in lieu of a meeting; requiring advance notice of stockholder intention to put forth director nominees or bring up other business at a stockholders\u2019 meeting; prohibiting stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders; requiring a 66 2\u20443% majority stockholder approval in order for stockholders to amend certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or adopt new bylaws; providing that, subject to the rights of preferred shares, the directors will be divided into three classes and the number of directors is to be fixed exclusively by our board of directors; and providing that none of our directors may be removed without cause. Section 203 of the DGCL, from which we did not elect to opt out, provides that if a holder acquires 15% or more of our stock without prior approval of our board of directors, that holder will be subject to certain restrictions on its ability to acquire us within three years. These provisions may delay or deter a change in control of us, and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under federal securities laws and we cannot be certain whether the reduced reporting requirements applicable to such companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under federal securities laws. For as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company so long as our public float remains less than $250 million as of the last business day of our most recently-completed second fiscal quarter. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may decline or be more volatile.\nStockholder litigation could divert the attention of management from the day-to-day operation of our business or result in us incurring substantial costs and liabilities.\nWe cannot be sure that our stockholders will not initiate securities litigation against us in the future. If securities or stockholder derivative litigation were to be commenced against us, our defense of such litigation could divert the attention of management from the day-to-day operation of our business or result in us incurring substantial costs and liabilities, irrespective of the merits of the litigation.", "PERMNO": 13279, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "CHFS"}
