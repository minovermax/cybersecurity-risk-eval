{"cik": "1575793", "company": "Energous Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are subject to various risks that may materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. An investment in our common stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. In evaluating an investment in shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this prospectus.\nIf any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occurs, or if additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial later materialize, then our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our shares. The risks discussed below include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have no history of generating sales or license revenue, have a history of operating losses, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have a limited operating history upon which investors may evaluate our prospects. We have never generated sales or license revenues and we have a history of losses from operations. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $51,145,478, that included accumulated expense of $26,442,177 from changes in value of derivative liabilities and, accumulated stock based compensation expense of $2,564,126. Our ability to achieve material revenue-generating operations, and ultimately, achieve profitability will depend on whether we can obtain additional capital when we need it, complete the development of our technology and incorporate that technology into the products sold by our customers and then find customers who will purchase our future products and services. There can be no assurance that we will ever generate revenues or achieve profitability.\nTerms of our development and licensing agreement with a tier-one consumer electronics company could inhibit potential licensees from working with us in specific markets.\nWe have entered into a development and licensing agreement with a tier-one consumer products company that provides that company a time-to-market advantage for certain consumer products. The time-to-market advantage might inhibit another potential licensee from engaging with us or they may be pressured to seek other solutions which could have a negative impact on our future revenue opportunities.\nOur efforts may never demonstrate the feasibility of our technology.\nWe have developed a working prototype of our technology but significant additional research and development activity will be required before we achieve a commercial product. Our research and development efforts remain subject to all of the risks associated with the development of new products based on emerging technologies, including without limitation unanticipated technical or other problems, the inability to develop a product that may be sold at an acceptable price point and the possible insufficiency of funds needed in order to complete development of these products and enable us to render services. Technical problems may result in delays and cause us to incur additional expenses that would increase our losses. If we cannot complete, or if we experience significant delays in developing our technology, and products and services based on such technology, for use in potential commercial applications, particularly after incurring significant expenditures, our business may fail. In particular, to our knowledge, the technological concepts we are applying to develop commercial applications of wire-free power for fixed and mobile low-power rechargeable devices have not been previously successfully applied by anyone else, if we fail to develop a practical, efficient or economical commercial product based on those technological concepts, our business may fail.\nWe may not obtain FCC approval for our technology and existing laws or regulations or future legislative or regulatory changes may affect our business.\nOur wire-free charging technology involves the transmission of power using RF energy waves, which are subject to regulation by the FCC, and may be subject to regulation by other federal, state and local agencies. We intend to design our technology so that it will operate in the 2.4/5.8 GHz radio frequency range, which is the same range as Wi-Fi routers and several other wireless consumer electronics. For those types of products, the FCC grants what is known as Part 15 approval if, among other things, the specific absorption rate is below certain thresholds. In addition, because our technology involves the transmission of power greater than the power threshold limits of Part 15, we also expect to need to obtain FCC Part 18 approval. To our knowledge, the transmission of power using RF energy waves by a consumer product at the ranges we are proposing has not yet been approved and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain this FCC approval or that other governmental approvals will not be required. Our efforts to achieve required governmental approvals could be costly and time consuming and if we are unable to receive any such required approvals in a timely and cost-efficient manner our business and operating results may be materially adversely affected. The cost of compliance with new laws or regulations governing our technology or future products could adversely affect our financial results. New laws or regulations may impose restrictions or obligations on us that could force us to redesign our technology under development or other future products, and may impose restrictions that are not possible or practicable to comply with, which could cause our business to fail. We cannot predict the impact on our business of any legislation or regulations related to our technology or future products that may be enacted or adopted in the future.\nWe anticipate future losses and negative cash flow, and it is uncertain if or when we will become profitable.\nWe have not yet demonstrated an ability to generate license revenue, and we may never be able to produce material revenues or operate on a profitable basis. As a result, we have incurred losses since our inception and expect to experience operating losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future.\nWe expect to expend significant resources on hiring of personnel and startup costs, including payroll and benefits, product and ASIC testing and development, intellectual property development and prosecution, marketing and promotion, capital expenditures, working capital and general and administrative expenses. We expect to incur costs and expenses related to prototype development, consulting costs, laboratory development costs, obtaining regulatory approvals required for our technology and reference product designs, marketing and other promotional activities, hiring of personnel, and the continued development of relationships with strategic business partners. We may not be able to obtain financing in a sufficient amount or at all. We anticipate our losses will continue to increase from current levels during our development stage.\nWe expect to require additional financing to achieve our business plans.\nWe believe our technology is novel in offering the potential to make wire-free charging an affordable, ubiquitous and convenient service for end users. However, the consumer and commercial electronics industry in general and the power, recharging and alternative recharging segments of that industry in particular are subject to intense and increasing competition and rapidly evolving technologies. Accordingly, for our business plans to succeed we believe it will be important for us to move quickly to develop our technology, obtain required regulatory approvals and engage with strategic partners. As a small company, we may be unable to successfully implement our ambitions of targeting very large markets in an intensely competitive industry segment without significantly increasing our resources. We do not have sufficient funds to fully implement our business plan, the ultimate goal of which is to license our technology to device manufacturers, wireless service providers and other commercial partners to make wire-free charging an affordable, ubiquitous and convenient service for end users. We expect that, unless we are able to obtain non-dilutive financing through licensing revenues or other strategic partner transactions, we will need to raise capital through new financings. Such financings could include equity financing, which may be dilutive to stockholders, or debt financing, which would likely restrict our ability to borrow from other sources. In addition, such securities may contain rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our current stockholders. There can be no assurance that additional funds will be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail the development of our technology or materially curtail or reduce our operations. We could be forced to sell or dispose of our rights or assets. Any inability to raise adequate funds on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition, including the possibility that a lack of funds could cause our business to fail and liquidate with little or no return to investors.\nWe may have difficulty managing growth in our business.\nAs we expand our activities, there will be additional demands on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties, including issues relating to our research and development activities and retention of experienced scientists, managers and engineers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely execute our business plan. If we are unable to implement these actions in a timely manner, our results may be adversely affected.\nIf we successfully commercially launch a product, and our product does not achieve widespread market acceptance, we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business.\nAchieving acceptance of a wire-free recharging system as a preferred method to recharge low-power fixed and mobile electronic devices will be crucial to our continued success. Consumers and commercial customers will not begin to use or increase the use of our product unless they agree that the convenience of our solution would be worth the additional expense of purchasing our system. We have no history of marketing any product and we and our commercialization partners may fail to generate significant interest in the initial commercial products or any other product we or our partners may develop. These and other factors, including the following factors, may affect the rate and level of the market acceptance:\n\u2022 our system\u2019s price relative to other products or competing methods of recharging;\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022 the support and rate of acceptance of our technology and solutions with our joint development partners;\n\u2022 perception by users, both individual and enterprise users, of our system\u2019s convenience, safety, efficiency, and benefits compared to competing methods of recharging;\n\u2022 press and blog coverage, social media coverage, and other publicity and public relations factors which are not within our control; and\n\u2022 regulatory developments related to marketing our products or their inclusion in others\u2019 products.\nIf we are unable to achieve or maintain market acceptance, our business would be significantly harmed.\nIf we successfully commercially launch a product, we may experience seasonality or other unevenness in our financial results in consumer markets or a long and variable sales cycle in enterprise markets.\nWhile we do not now have license revenue or a commercial product, our strategy depends on developing a successful commercial product and effectively licensing our technology into the consumer, enterprise and commercial markets. We will need to understand procurement and buying cycles to be successful in licensing our technology into those markets. If we eventually generate a substantial portion of our revenues from licensing arrangements, we anticipate it is possible that demand for our technology could vary similarly with the market for products with which our technology may be used, for example, the market for new purchases of laptops, tablet, mobile phones, gaming systems, toys, wearables and the like. Such consumer markets are often seasonal, with peaks in and around the December holiday season and the August-September back-to-school season. Enterprises and commercial markets may have annual or other budgeting and buying cycles that could affect us, and, particularly if we are designated as a capital improvement project, we may have a long or unpredictable sales cycle.\nWe may not be able to achieve all the product features we seek to include in our product.\nWe have developed a prototype of our product concept that displays limited functionality in a laboratory setting. There are a variety of features we seek to include in our product that we have not yet achieved. While we believe recharging multiple devices on one transmitter at a commercially acceptable level may be possible theoretically, we have not yet achieved these results, even in the laboratory. We believe our research and development efforts will yield additional functionality over time. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving all the features we are targeting and our inability to do so may limit the appeal of our product to consumers.\nUse of our technology under development or other future products may require the user to purchase additional products to use with existing devices. To the extent these additional purchases are inconvenient, the adoption of our technology under development or other future products could be slowed, which would harm our business.\nFor rechargeable devices that will utilize our receiver technology, the technology may be embedded in a sleeve, case or other enclosure. For example, certain products such as remote controls or toys equipped with replaceable AA size or other sized batteries, would need to be outfitted with enhanced batteries and other hardware that would enable the devices to be rechargeable by our system. In each case, to use a device with our system, an end user will be required to retrofit the device with a receiver and may be required to upgrade the battery technology used with the device (unless, for example, a consumer electronics supply chain firm has built compatible battery technology and a receiver into the device). These additional steps and expenses may offset the convenience for some users and discourage some users from purchasing our technology under development or other future products. Such factors may inhibit adoption of our technology, which would harm our business. We have not developed the enhanced battery to be used in devices, and our ability to enable use of our technology with devices that will require an enhanced battery will depend on our ability to develop a commercial version of such an enhanced battery that could be manufactured at a reasonable cost. If we fail to develop or enable a commercially practicable enhanced battery, we expect our business would be harmed, and we may need to change our strategy and target markets.\nLaboratory conditions differ from field conditions, which could affect the effectiveness of our technology under development or other future products. Failures to effectively move from laboratory to the field would harm our business.\nOur technology, when used in the field, may not be able to match the observations, developments, test results and performance that our technology may be able to achieve (and we may be able to document) under controlled laboratory circumstances. As one example of the difference between ideal laboratory conditions and field use, consider that in the laboratory, we can arrange for the transmitter to have line-of-sight transmission to a receiver. If we intend to test the performance through obstructions, we can control the configurations of the obstructions and the materials from which such obstructions are made. In the field, however, the receiver may be obscured or obstructed, or placed around a corner. Also, in the field we will have no control over the configuration of the obstructions or the materials that comprise each obstruction. These conditions may significantly decrease or eliminate the power received at the receiver or the effective range, because the RF energy from the transmitter may be absorbed by obscuring or blocking material or may need to be reflected off of a surface to reach the receiver, making the transmission distance longer than straight-line distances. The failure of our technology under development or other future products to be able to meet the demands of users in the field would harm our business.\nSafety concerns and legal action by private parties may affect our business.\nWe believe that our technology is safe. However, it is possible that we could discover safety issues with our technology or keep that some people may be concerned with wire-free transmission of power in a manner that has occurred with some other wireless technologies as they were put into residential and commercial use, such as the safety concerns that were raised by some regarding the use of cellular telephones and other devices to transmit data wirelessly in close proximity to the human body. While we plan to at least partially address this potential concern by developing our management software to be configurable by users to selectively recharge devices in ways that would be intended to avoid recharging in close proximity to a human body, such as recharging only during predetermined time periods or recharging only when the device is not moving, we do not plan to conduct any tests to determine whether RF waves produce harmful effects on humans or other animals. We may be unable to effectively prevent recharging in close proximity to a user\u2019s body, which could affect the marketability of our technology or could result in requests for law or regulation governing our technology under development or a class of products in which our technology under development would be included. In addition, while we believe our technology is safe, users of our technology under development or other future products who suffer medical ailments may blame the use of our products, as occurred with a small number of users of cellular telephones. A discovery of safety issues relating to our technology would have a material adverse effect on our business and any legal action against us claiming our products caused harm could be expensive, divert management and adversely affect us or cause our business to fail, whether or not such legal actions were ultimately successful.\nOur industry is subject to intense competition and rapid technological change, which may result in products or new solutions that are superior to our technology under development or other future products we may bring to market from time to time. If we are unable to anticipate or keep pace with changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation and customer demands, our products may become less useful or obsolete and our operating results will suffer.\nThe consumer and commercial electronics industry in general and the power, recharging and alternative recharging segments of that industry in particular are subject to intense and increasing competition and rapidly evolving technologies. Because our products are expected to have long development cycles, we must anticipate changes in the marketplace and the direction of technological innovation and customer demands. To compete successfully, we will need to demonstrate the advantages of our products and technologies over well-established alternative solutions, products and technologies, as well as newer methods of power delivery and convince consumers and enterprises of the advantages of our products and technologies. Traditional wall plug-in recharging remains an inexpensive alternative to our technology under development. Also, directly competing technologies such as inductive charging, magnetic resonance charging, conductive charging, ultrasound and other yet unidentified solutions may have greater consumer acceptance than the technologies we have developed. Furthermore, certain competitors may have greater resources than us and may be better established in the market than we are. We cannot be certain which other companies may have already decided to or may in the future choose to enter our markets. For example, consumer electronics products companies may invest substantial resources in wireless power or other recharging technologies and may decide to enter our target markets. Successful developments of competitors that result in new approaches for recharging could reduce the attractiveness of our products or render them obsolete.\nOur future success will depend in large part on our ability to establish and maintain a competitive position in current and future technologies. Rapid technological development may render our technology under development or future products based on our technology obsolete. Many of our competitors have or may have greater corporate, financial, operational, sales and marketing resources, and more experience in research and development than we have. We cannot assure you that our competitors will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our products or that would render our technologies and products obsolete. We may not have or be able to raise or develop the financial resources, technical expertise, marketing, distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain a competitive position with our technologies.\nOur competitive position also depends on our ability to:\n\u2022 generate widespread awareness, acceptance and adoption by the consumer and enterprise markets of our technology under development and future products;\n\u2022 design a product that may be sold at an acceptable price point;\n\u2022 develop new or enhanced technologies or features that improve the convenience, efficiency, safety or perceived safety, and productivity of our technology under development and future products;\n\u2022 properly identify customer needs and deliver new products or product enhancements to address those needs;\n\u2022 limit the time required from proof of feasibility to routine production;\n\u2022 limit the timing and cost of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 attract and retain qualified personnel;\n\u2022 protect our inventions with patents or otherwise develop proprietary products and processes; and\n\u2022 secure sufficient capital resources to expand both our continued research and development, and sales and marketing efforts.\nIf our technology under development is not or our future products are not competitive based on these or other factors, our business would be harmed.\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies, and we may not be able to ensure their protection.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to obtain, maintain and protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products. Patents and other proprietary rights provide uncertain protections, and we may be unable to protect our intellectual property. For example, we may be unsuccessful in defending our patents and other proprietary rights against third party challenges.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had in excess of 125 pending U.S. patents and provisional patent applications on file, but do not have any issued patents to protect our technology.\nIn addition to patents, we expect to rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical security measures to protect our intellectual property rights. These measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products. If they do not protect our rights adequately, third parties could use our technology, and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced. Although we are attempting to obtain patent coverage for our technology where available and where we believe appropriate, there are aspects of the technology for which patent coverage may never be sought or received. We may not possess the resources to or may not choose to pursue patent protection outside the United States or any or every country other than the United States where we may eventually decide to sell our future products. Our ability to prevent others from making or selling duplicate or similar technologies will be impaired in those countries in which we have no patent protection. Although we have in excess of 125 pending U.S. patents and provisional patent applications on file in the United States protecting aspects of our technology under development, our patents may not issue as a result of those applications drawing priority or otherwise based on those patent applications, may issue only with limited coverage or may issue and be subsequently successfully challenged by others and held invalid or unenforceable.\nSimilarly, even if patents do issue based on our applications or future applications, any issued patents may not provide us with any competitive advantages. Competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products that provide outcomes comparable or superior to ours. Our patents may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges by third parties, and others may challenge the inventorship or ownership of our patents and pending patent applications. In addition, if we choose to and are able to secure protection in countries outside the United States, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In the event a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those rights may be difficult and time consuming. Even if successful, litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge could be expensive and time consuming and could divert our management\u2019s attention. We may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against a challenge.\nWe may also in the future as one of our strategies to deploy our technology into the market, license patent and other proprietary rights to aspects of our technology to third parties and customers. Disputes with our licensors may arise regarding the scope and content of these licenses. Further, our ability to expand into additional fields with our technologies may be restricted by our existing licenses or licenses we may grant to third parties in the future.\nThe policies we use to protect our trade secrets may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of our trade secrets by others. In addition, confidentiality agreements executed by our employees, consultants and advisors may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure. Litigating a trade secret claim is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge methods and know-how. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be unable to prevent competitors from using our own inventions and intellectual property to compete against us, and our business may be harmed.\nWe may be subject to patent infringement or other intellectual property lawsuits which may be costly to defend.\nBecause our industry is characterized by competing intellectual property, we may be sued for violating the intellectual property rights of others. Determining whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues, and the outcome of patent litigation actions is often uncertain. We have not conducted any significant search of patents issued to third parties, and no assurance can be given that third party patents containing claims covering our products, parts of our products, technology or methods do not exist, have not been filed, or could not be filed or issued. Because of the number of patents issued and patent applications filed in our technical areas or fields (including some pertaining specifically to wireless charging technologies), our competitors or other third parties may assert that our products and the methods we employ in the use of our products are covered by United States or foreign patents held by them. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue and because publication schedules for pending applications vary by jurisdiction, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware, and which may result in issued patents that our technology under development or other future products would infringe. Also, because the claims of published patent applications can change between publication and patent grant, there may be published patent applications that may ultimately issue with claims that we infringe. There could also be existing patents that one or more of our products or parts may infringe and of which we are unaware. As the number of competitors in the market for wire-free power and alternative recharging solutions increases, and as the number of patents issued in this area grows, the possibility of patent infringement claims against us increases. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nIn the event that we become subject to a patent infringement or other intellectual property lawsuit and if the relevant patents or other intellectual property were upheld as valid and enforceable and we were found to infringe or violate the terms of a license to which we are a party, we could be prevented from selling any infringing products of ours unless we could obtain a license or were able to redesign the product to avoid infringement. If we were unable to obtain a license or successfully redesign, we might be prevented from selling our technology under development or other future products. If there is an allegation or determination that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of a competitor or other person, we may be required to pay damages, or a settlement or ongoing royalties. In these circumstances, we may be unable to sell our products at competitive prices or at all, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe could become subject to product liability claims, product recalls, and warranty claims that could be expensive, divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business.\nOur business exposes us to potential liability risks that are inherent in the marketing and sale of products used by consumers. We may be held liable if our technology under development now or in the future causes injury or death or are found otherwise unsuitable during usage. Our technology under development incorporates sophisticated components and computer software. Complex software can contain errors, particularly when first introduced. In addition, new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that, despite testing, are discovered only after installation. While we believe our technology is safe, users could allege or possibly prove defects (some of which could be alleged or proved to cause harm to users or others) because we design our products to perform complex functions involving RF energy, possibly in close proximity to users. A product liability claim, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could result in significant legal defense costs. The coverage limits of our insurance policies we may choose to purchase to cover related risks may not be adequate to cover future claims. If sales of our products increase or we suffer future product liability claims, we may be unable to maintain product liability insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or with adequate amounts. A product liability claim, any product recalls or excessive warranty claims, whether arising from defects in design or manufacture or otherwise, could negatively affect our sales or require a change in the design or manufacturing process, any of which could harm our reputation and business, harm our relationship with licensors of our products, result in a decline in revenue and harm our business.\nIn addition, if a product we designed is defective, whether due to design or manufacturing defects, improper use of the product or other reasons, we or our strategic partners may be required to notify regulatory authorities and/or to recall the product. A required notification to a regulatory authority or recall could result in an investigation by regulatory authorities of our products, which could in turn result in required recalls, restrictions on the sale of the products or other penalties. The adverse publicity resulting from any of these actions could adversely affect the perception of our customers and potential customers. These investigations or recalls, especially if accompanied by unfavorable publicity, could result in our incurring substantial costs, losing revenues and damaging our reputation, each of which would harm our business.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our utilization of consultants.\nTo improve productivity and accelerate our development efforts while we build out our own engineering team, we use experienced consultants to assist in selected business functions, including the development of our ASICs. We take steps to monitor and regulate the performance of these independent third parties. However, arrangements with third party service providers may make our operations vulnerable if these consultants fail to satisfy their obligations to us as a result of their performance, changes in their own operations, financial condition, or other matters outside of our control. Effective management of our consultants is important to our business and strategy. The failure of our consultants to perform as anticipated could result in substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention from other strategic activities, or create other operational or financial problems for us. Terminating or transitioning arrangements with key consultants could result in additional costs and a risk of operational delays, potential errors and possible control issues as a result of the termination or during the transition.\nWe expect to depend on consumer electronics supply chain firms to manufacture, market and distribute our technology under development. If these strategic partners fail to successfully manufacture, market and distribute our technology under development, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe currently intend to license our system architecture, proprietary waveform, antenna design and ASIC designs to consumer electronics supply chain firms rather than manufacture our technology under development ourselves. We will not be able to control the efforts and resources these consumer electronics supply chain firms would devote to marketing our technology under development or other future products. Those third parties may not be able to successfully market and sell the products they develop based on our technology, may not devote sufficient time and resources to support the marketing and selling efforts and may not market those products at prices that will permit the products to develop, achieve or sustain market acceptance. Finding new licensors could be an expensive and time-consuming process and we may not be able to find suitable consumer electronics supply chain firms and other distribution strategic partners on acceptable terms or at all. If we cannot find suitable third party partners or our third party partners experience difficulties, do not actively market our technology under development or future products or do not otherwise perform under our license agreements, our potential for revenue may be dramatically reduced, and our business could be harmed.\nWe intend to pursue licensing of our technology as a primary means of commercialization but we may not be able to secure advantageous license agreements. If we are not able to secure advantageous license agreements, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe are pursuing the licensing of our technology as a primary means of commercialization. We believe there are many companies that would be interested in implementing our technology into their devices. Many of these companies are well-known, world-wide companies. We have entered into one product development and license agreement with a tier-one consumer electronics company that has the potential to yield license revenue. In addition, we have also entered into a total of 16 joint development agreements providing for our development of reference designs which serve to describe the integration of our technology into the strategic partner\u2019s products. However, the joint development agreements do not commit either party to a long-term relationship and any of these parties may disengage with us at any time. Creating a license or other business relationship with these classes of companies will take a substantial effort, as we expect to have to convince them of the efficacy of our technology, meet their design and manufacturing requirements, satisfy their marketing and product needs, and comply with their selection, review and contracting requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to gain entry to these companies, or that they will ultimately decide to integrate our technology with their products. We may not be able to secure license agreements with customers on terms that are advantageous to us. Furthermore, the timing and volume of revenue earned from license agreements will be outside of our control. If the license agreements we enter into do not prove to be advantageous to us, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to develop a technology that meets our development partner's specifications. Even if we succeed in developing a technology that meets all the specifications in our development and licensing agreement, our development partner could decline to use our technology in its products. Any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe terms of our only development and licensing agreement with a tier-one consumer products company require us to meet stringent performance specifications and aggressive technical milestones. While we are devoting substantial corporate time and resources to the development of our technology for this company\u2019s products, there can be no assurance that we can meet the performance specifications and technical milestones in the timeframe required by the development and licensing agreement or at all. Further, the decision to embed our technology within its products is completely in our development partner\u2019s discretion and it could decline to use our technology in its products even if we meet all the performance specifications and technical milestones set forth in the agreement. Additionally, the development and licensing agreement prohibits us from the development of our technology for certain product categories until our development partner has introduced products with our technology embedded in those categories to consumers. If we are unable to meet the stringent performance specifications and aggressive technical milestones required by the development and licensing agreement or our development partner declines to embed our technology in its products, our business would be significantly harmed. The harm to our business resulting from either of these scenarios will exacerbated by the fact that we have agreed to limited exclusivity in certain product categories with our development partner.\nWe are highly dependent on certain key members of our executive management team. Our inability to retain these individuals could impede our business plan and growth strategies, which could have a negative impact on our business and the value of your investment.\nOur ability to implement our business plan depends, to a critical extent, on the continued efforts and services of Stephen Rizzone (Chief Executive Officer), Michael Leabman (Chief Technology Officer), George Holmes (Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing) and Cesar Johnston (Senior Vice President of Engineering). If we lose the services of any of these persons, we would likely be forced to expend significant time and money in the pursuit of replacements, which may result in a delay in the implementation of our business plan and plan of operations. We can give no assurance that we could find satisfactory replacements for these individuals on terms that would not be unduly expensive or burdensome to us. We do not currently carry a key-man life insurance policy that would assist us in recouping our costs in the event of the death or disability of either of these executives.\nOur long-term success and growth strategy depend on our ability to attract, integrate and retain high-level engineering talent.\nBecause of the highly specialized and complex nature of our business, our success and future growth also depends on management\u2019s ability to attract, hire, train, integrate and retain high-level engineering talent. Competition for such personnel is intense as we compete for talent as a pre-revenue company against many large profitable companies and our inability to adequately staff our operations with highly qualified and well-trained engineers could render us less efficient and impede our ability to develop and deliver a commercial product. Such a competitive market could put upward pressure on labor costs for engineering talent. In addition, rising costs associated with certain employee benefits, in particular employee health coverage, could limit our ability to provide certain employee benefits in the future. If we are unable to provide a competitive employee benefits package, including continuing equity incentive grants, recruiting and retaining qualified personnel may become more difficult.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nAs an investor, you may lose all of your investment.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. As an investor you may never recoup all, or even part of, your investment and you may never realize any return on your investment. You must be prepared to lose all of your investment.\nOur stock price could be volatile and investors may have difficulty selling their shares.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \u201cWATT.\u201d For the period from March 28, 2014 when trading began on the NASDAQ Capital Market through December 31, 2014, the daily trading volume for shares of our common stock ranged from 6,200 to 2,403,900 shares traded per day, and the average daily trading volume during such period was 162,713 shares.\nThe market price of the common stock has fluctuated significantly since it was first listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market on March 28, 2014. Since this date, through December 31, 2014, the intra-day trading price has fluctuated from a low of $7.11 to a high of $16.44. The price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly in response to factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated variations in operating results;\n\u2022 the limited number of holders of the common stock;\n\u2022 changes in the economic performance and/or market valuations of other technology companies;\n\u2022 our announcements of significant strategic partnerships or other events;\n\u2022 announcements by other companies in the wire-free charging space;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022 sales or other transactions involving our capital stock, including sales that may occur following the termination of applicable lock-up periods.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act of 2012 and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30.\nOur status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act of 2012 may make it more difficult to raise capital as and when we need it.\nBecause of the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our reporting is not as transparent as other companies in our industry. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and have no immediate plans to pay dividends.\nWe plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have earnings, in order to market our products and to cover operating costs and to otherwise become and remain competitive. We do not plan to pay any cash dividends with respect to our securities in the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you that we would, at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend.\nConcentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, directors and significant stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAll decisions with respect to the management of the Company will be made by our board of directors and our officers, who collectively, beneficially own approximately 4.4% of our common stock, as calculated in accordance with Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In addition, other greater than 5% stockholders such as DvineWave Holdings LLC which beneficially owns approximately 15% of our common stock, AWM Investment Company Inc. which beneficially owns approximately 7% of our common stock and Absolute Ventures, which owns approximately 5% of our common stock, as calculated in accordance with Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our Company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant costs as a result of being a public company that reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission and our management will be required to devote substantial time to meet compliance obligations.\nAs a public company reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. We are subject to reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC that impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. In addition, on July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that are expected to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources. Our management and other personnel are expected to devote a substantial amount of time to these new compliance initiatives. In addition, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable.\nProvisions of our Certificate of Incorporation (\u201cCertificate\u201d) and bylaws and applicable provisions of Delaware law may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. The provisions in our Certificate and bylaws:\n\u2022 authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval and to designate the rights, preferences and privileges of each class; if issued, such preferred stock would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could include terms that may deter an acquisition of us;\n\u2022 limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022 do not permit stockholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022 do not provide for cumulative voting rights; and\n\u2022 provide that all vacancies may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may limit our ability to engage in any business combination with a person who beneficially owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock unless certain conditions are satisfied. This restriction lasts for a period of three years following the share acquisition. These provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive you of the opportunity to sell your shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14556, "SIC": 3690, "TIC": "WATT"}
