{"cik": "891166", "company": "UNIVERSAL INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to a variety of risks, the most significant of which are described below. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks.\nRisks Relating to the Property-Casualty Business\nAs a property and casualty insurer, we may face significant losses from catastrophes and severe weather events\nBecause of the exposure of our property and casualty business to catastrophic events, our operating results and financial condition may vary significantly from one period to the next. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural and man-made disasters, including wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, tropical storms, sinkholes and certain types of terrorism. Because of our concentration in Florida, we are particularly exposed to hurricanes and windstorms affecting Florida. We may incur catastrophe losses in excess of: those experienced in prior years; those estimated by a catastrophe model we use; the average expected level used in pricing; and our current reinsurance coverage limits.\nIn addition, we are subject to claims arising from weather events such as rain, hail and high winds. The incidence and severity of weather conditions are largely unpredictable. There is generally an increase in the frequency and severity of property claims when severe weather conditions occur. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be predicted and could be material to our operations. In addition, impacts of catastrophes and our catastrophe management strategy may adversely affect premium growth.\nAlthough we use widely recognized and commercially available models to estimate hurricane loss exposure, other models exist that might produce higher or lower loss estimates. The loss estimates developed by the models are dependent upon assumptions or scenarios incorporated by a third-party developer and by us (or our representatives). However if these assumptions or scenarios do not reflect the characteristics of future catastrophic events that affect areas covered by our policies or the resulting economic conditions, then we could have exposure for losses not covered by our reinsurance program.\nDespite our catastrophe management programs, we retain significant exposure to catastrophic events. Our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which result in extraordinary losses and have a negative impact on our business.\nUnanticipated increases in the severity or frequency of claims may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition\nChanges in the severity or frequency of claims may affect our profitability. Changes in homeowners\u2019 claim severity are driven by inflation in the construction industry, in building materials and in home furnishings and by other economic and environmental factors, including increased demand for services and supplies in areas affected by catastrophes. However, changes in the level of the severity of claims are not limited to the effects of inflation and demand surge in these various sectors of the economy. Increases in claim severity can arise from unexpected events that are inherently difficult to predict. Although we pursue various loss management initiatives in order to mitigate future increases in claim severity, there can be no assurances that these initiatives will successfully identify or reduce the effect of future increases in claim severity.\nWe may experience declines in claim frequency from time to time. The short-term level of claim frequency we experience may vary from period to period and may not be sustainable over the longer term. A significant long-term increase in claim frequency could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nActual claims incurred may exceed current reserves established for claims and may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition\nRecorded claim reserves in the property-casualty business are based on our best estimates of losses, both reported and IBNR, after considering known facts and interpretations of circumstances. Internal factors are considered including our experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends involving claim payment patterns, pending levels of unpaid claims and contractual terms. External factors are also considered which include but are not limited to changes in the law, court decisions, changes to regulatory requirements and economic conditions. Because reserves are estimates of the unpaid portion of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nPredicting claim expense relating to environmental liabilities is inherently uncertain and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition\nThe process of estimating environmental liabilities is complicated by complex legal issues concerning, among other things, the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are, or were ever intended to be covered; and whether losses could be recoverable through reinsurance. Litigation is often a complex, lengthy process that involves substantial uncertainty for insurers. Actuarial techniques and databases used in estimating environmental net loss reserves may prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable loss. Ultimate net losses from environmental liabilities could materially exceed established loss reserves and expected recoveries and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe failure of the risk mitigation strategies we utilize could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations\nWe utilize a number of strategies to mitigate our risk exposure, such as:\n\u00b7\nengaging in rigorous underwriting;\n\u00b7\ncarefully evaluating terms and conditions of our policies; and\n\u00b7\nceding risk to reinsurers.\nHowever, there are inherent limitations in all of these strategies and no assurance can be given that an event or series of events will not result in loss levels in excess of our probable maximum loss models, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. It is also possible that losses could manifest themselves in ways that we do not anticipate and that our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address. Such a manifestation of losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThese risks may be heightened during difficult economic conditions such as those recently experienced in Florida and elsewhere.\nReinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, which may limit our ability to write new business or to adequately mitigate our exposure to loss\nOur reinsurance program is designed, utilizing our risk management methodology, to help mitigate our exposure to catastrophes. Market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. No assurances can be made that reinsurance will remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as are currently available. For example, our ability to afford reinsurance to reduce our catastrophe risk may be dependent upon our ability to adjust premium rates for our cost, and there are no assurances that the terms and rates for our current reinsurance program will continue to be available next year. If we are unable to maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts that we consider sufficient and at prices that we consider acceptable, we would have to either accept an increase in our exposure risk, reduce our insurance writings, or develop or seek other alternatives.\nRegulation limiting rate changes and requiring us to participate in loss sharing or assessments may decrease our profitability\nFrom time to time, political dispositions affect the insurance market, including efforts to effectively maintain rates that allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. Despite efforts to remove politics from insurance regulation, facts and history demonstrate that public policymakers, when faced with untoward events and adverse public sentiment, can act in ways that impede a satisfactory correlation between rates and risk. Such acts may affect our ability to obtain approval for rate changes that may be required to attain rate adequacy along with targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity. Our ability to afford reinsurance required to reduce our catastrophe risk may be dependent upon the ability to adjust rates for our cost.\nAdditionally, we are required to participate in guaranty funds for insolvent insurance companies and other statutory insurance entities. The guaranty funds and other statutory entities periodically levy assessments against all insurance companies doing business in the state and the amounts and timing of those assessments are unpredictable. Our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors.\nThe potential benefits of implementing our profitability model may not be fully realized\nWe believe that our profitability model has allowed us to be more competitive and operate more profitably than other similarly situated insurers. However, because many of our competitors have adopted underwriting criteria and sophisticated models similar to those we use and because other competitors may follow suit, our competitive advantage could decline or be lost. Competitive pressures could also force us to modify our profitability model. Furthermore, we cannot be assured that the profitability model will accurately reflect the level of losses that we will ultimately incur from the business generated.\nOur financial condition and operating results and the financial condition and operating results of our Insurance Entities may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business\nThe property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. A downturn in the profitability cycle of the property and casualty business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRenewed weakness in the Florida real estate market could adversely affect our loss results\nAs of December 31, 2014, approximately 91% of our policies in force and 88% of total insured values were derived from customers located in Florida. In recent years, Florida experienced a significant economic downturn and among the highest real estate value diminution in the country. While the real estate market in Florida appears to be on the rebound, renewed weakness in that market could result in fewer home sales, which may adversely affect the number of policies we are able to sell and/or the rates we are able to charge to customers. Additionally, higher incidents of foreclosed or vacant homes may result in increased claims activity under residential insurance policies, which could negatively affect our operating results.\nChanging climate conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, profitability or cash flows\nProperty and casualty insurers are subject to claims arising from catastrophes. Catastrophic losses have had a significant impact on our historical results. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, tsunamis, windstorms, earthquakes, hailstorms, explosions, flooding, severe winter weather and fires and may include man-made events, such as terrorist attacks. The incidence, frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable.\nLonger-term weather trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, including effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperature, sea levels, rain and snow. The science regarding climate change is still emerging and developing. However, to the extent the frequency or severity of weather events is exacerbated due to climate change, we may experience increases in catastrophe losses in both coastal and non-coastal areas.\nBecause we conduct the majority of our business in Florida, our financial results substantially depend on the regulatory, economic and weather conditions present in that state\nThough we are licensed to transact insurance business in Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and South Carolina, we still write a substantial majority of our premium in Florida; therefore, prevailing regulatory, legal, economic, political, demographic, competitive, weather and other conditions in Florida affect our revenues and profitability. Changes in conditions could make doing business in Florida less attractive for us and would have a more pronounced effect on us than it would on other insurance companies that are more geographically diversified.\nWe are subject to increased exposure to certain catastrophic events such as hurricanes, as well as an increased risk of resulting losses. The occurrence of one or more catastrophic events or other conditions affecting losses in Florida may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have been entering and in the future may enter new markets, but there can be no assurance that our diversification strategy will be effective\nAlthough we intend to continue focusing on Florida as a key market for our insurance products, we have in the past, and may in the future, seek to take advantage of prudent opportunities to expand our core business into other states where we believe the independent agent distribution channel is strong. As a result of a number of factors, including the difficulties of finding appropriate expansion opportunities and the challenges of operating in an unfamiliar market, we may not be successful in this diversification. Additionally, in order to carry out any such strategy, we would need to obtain the appropriate licenses from the insurance regulatory authority of any such state if we are not currently licensed to transact business in any state.\nBecause we rely on insurance agents, the loss of these agent relationships or our ability to attract new agents could have an adverse impact on our business\nWe currently market our policies to a broad range of prospective policyholders through approximately 7,000 independent insurance agents. Many of these agents are independent insurance agents that own their customer relationships, and our agency contracts with them limit our ability to directly solicit business from our existing policyholders. Independent agents most commonly represent other insurance companies, and we do not control their activities. Certain of those insurance companies pay higher commissions than we do, provide services to the agents that we do not provide, or are otherwise more attractive to the agents than we are. We cannot assure you that we will retain our current relationships, or be able to establish new relationships, with insurance agents. The loss of these marketing relationships could adversely impact our ability to attract new agents, retain our agency network, or write new or renewal insurance policies.\nChanges to Florida\u2019s wind mitigation discount law could materially affect our income\nFlorida law currently mandates that insurance companies offer a reduction in insurance premiums for policyholders whose properties have certain features that increase such properties\u2019 ability to withstand windstorm damage, based on an inspection of such properties. Changes to the current wind loss mitigation program in Florida could require that we provide greater premium discounts or reconfigure existing discount programs, which could affect our income.\nRisks Relating to Investments\nWe are subject to market risk which may adversely impact investment income\nOur primary market risk exposures are changes in equity prices and interest rates. A decline in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our investment income as we invest cash in new interest bearing investments that may yield less than our portfolio\u2019s average rate of return. A decline in market interest rates could also lead us to purchase longer-term or riskier assets in order to obtain adequate investment yields resulting in a duration gap when compared to the duration of liabilities. An increase in market interest rates could also have an adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio by decreasing the fair values of the fixed maturity securities that comprise a large portion of our investment portfolio. A decline in the quality of our investment portfolio as a result of adverse economic conditions or otherwise could cause additional realized losses on securities.\nOur overall financial performance is dependent in part on the returns on our investment portfolio, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or cause such results to be volatile\nThe performance of our investment portfolio is independent of the revenue and income generated from our insurance operations, and there is no direct correlation between the financial results of these two activities. Thus, to the extent that our investment portfolio does not perform well due to the factors discussed above or otherwise, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected even if our insurance operations perform favorably. Further, because the returns on our investment portfolio may be volatile, our overall results of operations may likewise be volatile from period to period even if we do not experience significant financial variances in our insurance operations.\nRisks Relating to the Insurance Industry\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and potential further restrictive regulation may increase our operating costs and limit our growth\nThe laws and regulations affecting the insurance industry are complex and subject to change. Moreover, they are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities, including state insurance regulators, state securities administrators, the SEC, the U.S. Department of Justice, and state attorneys general, each of which exercises a degree of interpretive latitude. Consequently, we are subject to the risk that compliance with any particular regulator\u2019s or enforcement authority\u2019s interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another\u2019s interpretation of the same issue, particularly when compliance is judged in hindsight. In addition, there is risk that any particular regulator\u2019s or enforcement authority\u2019s interpretation of a legal issue may change over time to our detriment, or that changes in the overall legal environment may, even absent any particular regulator\u2019s or enforcement authority\u2019s interpretation of a legal issue changing, cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective, thus necessitating changes to our practices that may, in some cases, limit our ability to grow and achieve or improve the profitability of our business. Furthermore, in some cases, these laws and regulations are designed to protect or benefit the interests of a specific constituency rather than a range of constituencies. For example, state insurance laws and regulations are generally intended to protect or benefit purchasers or users of insurance products, not holders of securities issued by us. In many respects, these laws and regulations limit our ability to grow and improve the profitability of our business.\nThe Insurance Entities are highly regulated by state insurance authorities in Florida, the state in which each is domiciled, and UPCIC is also regulated by state insurance authorities in the other states in which it conducts business. Such regulations, among other things, require that certain transactions between the Insurance Entities and their affiliates must be fair and reasonable and require prior notice and non-disapproval by the applicable state insurance authority. State regulations also limit the amount of dividends and other payments that can be made by the Insurance Entities without prior regulatory approval and impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments the Insurance Entities may have. These regulations also affect many other aspects of the Insurance Entities\u2019 businesses. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase UIH\u2019s direct and indirect compliance efforts and other expenses of doing business. If the Insurance Entities fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the regulatory agencies can revoke or suspend their licenses, withhold or withdraw required approvals, require corrective action and impose operating limitations, impose penalties or pursue other remedies available under applicable laws and regulations.\nState legislatures and insurance regulators regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, can be made for the benefit of the consumer, or for other reasons, at the expense of insurers, and thus could have an adverse effect on UIH\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nRecently there has been increased scrutiny of the insurance regulatory framework in the United States and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that alter, and in many cases increase, state authority to regulate insurance holding companies and insurance companies. The Insurance Entities\u2019 domiciliary state has adopted legislation introducing the concept of \u201centerprise risk\u201d within an insurance holding company system. These new laws impose more extensive informational requirements on parents and other affiliates of licensed insurers with the purpose of protecting the licensed companies from enterprise risk. The new laws require the ultimate controlling person of an insurance holding company system to file an annual enterprise risk report identifying the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the licensed companies. While UIH believes the Company is well prepared to comply with the new laws, UIH cannot guarantee the impact of any interpretations of the new law or the potential impact of other proposed or future legislation or rule-making in the U.S. or elsewhere would not have an adverse effect on UIH\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nAlthough the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including employee benefits regulation, age, sex and disability-based discrimination, financial services regulation, securities regulation and federal taxation, can significantly affect the insurance business. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury headed by a Director appointed by the Treasury Secretary. The Federal Insurance Office is designed principally to exercise a monitoring and information gathering role, rather than a regulatory role. Nonetheless, these activities could ultimately lead to changes in the regulation of insurers and reinsurers in the United States, including insurance group holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires extensive rule-making and other future regulatory action, which in some cases will take a period of years to implement.\nIn recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under public scrutiny and members of Congress have discussed proposals to provide for federal chartering of insurance companies. We can make no assurances regarding the potential impact of state or federal measures that may change the nature or scope of insurance regulation.\nUIH is a holding company and, consequently, its cash flow is dependent on dividends, interest and other permissible payments from its subsidiaries\nUIH is a holding company that conducts no insurance operations of its own. All operations are conducted by the Insurance Entities and by other operating subsidiaries that primarily support the business of the Insurance Entities. As a holding company, UIH\u2019s sources of cash flow consist primarily of dividends, interest and other permissible payments from its subsidiaries. The ability of the Insurance Entities to make such payments is limited by applicable law, as set forth in Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Insurance Operations-Government Regulation and Initiatives-Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions\u201d in this Form 10-K. The ability of our other subsidiaries to pay dividends may be adversely affected by reductions in the premiums or number of policies written by the Insurance Entities, by changes in the terms of the parties\u2019 contracts, or by changes in the regulation of insurance holding company systems. UIH depends on such payments for general corporate purposes, for its capital management activities and payment of any dividends to its common shareholders. For more details on our cash flows, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nUIH could be adversely affected if the Insurance Entities\u2019 controls designed to ensure compliance with guidelines, policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective\nThe Insurance Entities\u2019 business is highly dependent on the ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting, claims processing and investment activities, many of which are highly complex. These activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies, as well as legal and regulatory standards. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable guarantee that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. The Insurance Entities\u2019 failure to comply with these guidelines, policies or standards could lead to financial loss, unanticipated risk exposure, regulatory sanctions or penalties, civil or administrative litigation, or damage to UIH\u2019s reputation.\nLitigation or regulatory actions could have a material adverse impact on UIH\nThe Insurance Entities and their affiliates from time to time are subject to civil or administrative actions and litigation. Civil litigation frequently results when the Insurance Entities do not pay insurance claims in the amounts or at the times demanded by policyholders or their representatives. The Insurance Entities also may be subject to litigation or administrative actions arising from the conduct of their business and the regulatory authority of state insurance departments. Further, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to other types of litigation inherent in operating their businesses, employing personnel, contracting with vendors and otherwise carrying out their affairs. Current and future litigation or regulatory matters may negatively affect UIH by resulting in the payment of substantial awards or settlements, increasing legal and compliance costs, requiring UIH to change certain aspects of its business operations, diverting management attention from other business issues, harming UIH\u2019s reputation with customers or making it more difficult to retain current customers and to recruit and retain employees or agents. See \u201cItem 8 - Note 5 (Insurance Operations) and Note 15 (Commitments and Contingencies)\u201d.\nThe amount of statutory capital that each of the Insurance Entities has and the amount of statutory capital it must hold can vary and is sensitive to a number of factors outside of UIH\u2019s control, including market conditions and the regulatory environment and rules\nInsurance regulators adopt accounting standards and statutory capital and reserve requirements for the Insurance Entities. In addition, the rating agencies responsible for reviewing the Insurance Entities have their own metrics for evaluating the Insurance Entities\u2019 financial strength. In any particular year, the Insurance Entities\u2019 statutory surplus amounts and financial ratios may change depending on a variety of factors. Further, the requirements and ratios adopted by regulatory authorities or rating agencies may change over time. The Insurance Entities\u2019 failure to maintain compliance with current or future requirements could adversely affect our business.\nOur future results are dependent in part on our ability to successfully operate in an insurance industry that is highly competitive\nThe insurance industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have well-established national reputations and market similar products. In addition, we compete with companies that have greater capital resources and longer operating histories as well as with newly formed and less capitalized companies that might have more aggressive underwriting or pricing strategies. Because of the competitive nature of the insurance industry, including competition for producers such as independent agents, there can be no assurance that we will continue to develop and maintain productive relationships with independent agents, effectively compete with our industry rivals, or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. Our ability to successfully operate may also be impaired if we are not effective in filling critical leadership positions, in developing the talent and skills of our human resources, in assimilating new executive talent into our organization, or in deploying human resource talent consistent with our business goals.\nDifficult conditions in the economy generally could adversely affect our business and operating results\nIn recent years, the United States economy has experienced widespread job losses, higher unemployment, lower consumer spending, declines in home prices and substantial increases in delinquencies on consumer debt, including defaults on home mortgages. Moreover, past disruptions in the financial markets, particularly the reduced availability of credit and tightened lending requirements, affected the ability of borrowers to refinance loans at more affordable rates. A general economic slowdown also could adversely affect us in the form of consumer behavior and pressure on our investment portfolio. We cannot predict the likelihood of a future recession, but as with most businesses, we believe a longer or more severe recession than the one recently experienced could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA downgrade in our Financial Stability Rating\u00ae may have an adverse effect on our competitive position, the marketability of our product offerings, and our liquidity, operating results and financial condition\nFinancial Stability Ratings\u00ae are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and generally have an effect on an insurance company\u2019s business. On an ongoing basis, rating agencies review the financial performance and condition of insurers and could downgrade or change the outlook on an insurer\u2019s ratings due to, for example, a change in an insurer\u2019s statutory capital; a change in a rating agency\u2019s determination of the amount of risk-adjusted capital required to maintain a particular rating; a change in the perceived adequacy of an insurer\u2019s reinsurance program; an increase in the perceived risk of an insurer\u2019s investment portfolio; a reduced confidence in management or a host of other considerations that may or may not be within an insurer\u2019s control. Demotech, Inc., has assigned a Financial Stability Rating\u00ae of A for the Insurance Entities. Because these ratings are subject to continuous review, the retention of these ratings cannot be assured. A downgrade in or withdrawal of these ratings, or a decision by Demotech to require the Insurance Entities\u2019 parent company to make a capital infusion into the Insurance Entities to maintain their ratings, may adversely affect our liquidity, operating results and financial condition. Financial Stability Ratings\u00ae are primarily directed towards policyholders of the Insurance Entities, and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors in the Insurance Entities\u2019 ultimate parent, including holders of the Company\u2019s common stock, and are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to examination and actions by state insurance departments\nThe Insurance Entities are subject to extensive regulation in the states in which they do business. State insurance regulatory agencies conduct periodic examinations of the Insurance Entities on a wide variety of matters, including policy forms, premium rates, licensing, trade and claims practices, investment standards and practices, statutory capital and surplus requirements, reserve and loss ratio requirements and transactions among affiliates. Further, the Insurance Entities are required to file annual and other reports with state insurance regulatory agencies relating to financial condition, holding company issues and other matters. If an insurance company fails to obtain required licenses or approvals, or if the Insurance Entities fail to comply with other regulatory requirements, the regulatory agencies can suspend or revoke their licenses, withdraw or withhold required approvals, require corrective action and impose operating limitations, penalties or other remedies available under applicable laws and regulations.\nReinsurance subjects us to the credit risk of our reinsurers and may not be adequate to protect us against losses arising from ceded risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition\nReinsurance does not legally discharge us from our primary liability for the full amount of the risk we insure, although it does make the reinsurer liable to us in the event of a claim. As such, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. The collectability of reinsurance recoverables is subject to uncertainty arising from a number of factors, including changes in market conditions, whether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions under our reinsurance contracts for covered events such as windstorms, vandalism, brush fires, earthquakes and riots or are excluded explicitly for events such as a chemical terrorism event impacting our policyholders and whether reinsurers, or their affiliates, have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract. Our inability to collect a material recovery from a reinsurer could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may not buy enough reinsurance to cover a single substantial storm or multiple storms going forward or be able to timely or cost-effectively obtain reinsurance. The Insurance Entities are responsible for losses related to catastrophic events with incurred losses in excess of coverage provided by our reinsurance program and for losses that otherwise are not covered by the reinsurance program.\nAdverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or our ability to obtain credit on acceptable terms\nThe capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption. In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on the availability of liquidity and credit capacity. In the event that we need access to additional capital to pay our operating expenses, make payments on our indebtedness, pay for capital expenditures or fund acquisitions, our ability to obtain such capital may be limited and the cost of any such capital may be significant. Our access to additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to our industry, and credit capacity, as well as lenders\u2019 perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. Similarly, our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us. If a combination of these factors were to occur, our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient, and in such case, we may not be able to successfully obtain financing on favorable terms.\nLoss of key executives could affect our operations\nOur future operations will depend in large part on the efforts of our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Sean P. Downes, and on the efforts of our Chief Operating Officer, Jon W. Springer, both of whom have served in executive roles at the Company or its affiliates for many years. The loss of the services provided by Mr. Downes or Mr. Springer, could have a material adverse effect on the Company and on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBreaches of our information systems or denial of service on our website could have an adverse impact on our business and reputation\nOur business depends significantly on the effective operation of our information systems, as we retain confidential and proprietary information on them. We have committed and will continue to commit significant resources to develop, maintain and enhance our existing information systems, transition existing systems to upgraded systems and develop new information systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences.\nOur information systems have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to computer viruses, other malicious codes or other computer-related penetrations. To date, we are not aware of a material breach of cybersecurity. We commit significant resources to administrative and technical controls to prevent cyber incidents and protect our information technology, but our preventative actions to reduce the risk of cyber threats may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins and other cyber-attacks or security breaches. Such an event could compromise our confidential information as well as that of our customers and third parties with whom we interact, impede or interrupt business operations and may result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, additional regulatory scrutiny and litigation and reputational damage. In addition, any data security breach of our agents or third-party vendors, or any prolonged denial of service on our website, could harm our business and reputation.\nOur failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems and protect the security of such systems could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Debt Obligations\nOur revolving line of credit and term loan have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could have an adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nWe have entered into a revolving line of credit and term loan, each of which contains a number of affirmative and negative covenants so long as any amounts are outstanding thereunder. The negative covenants in these instruments limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nmerge, consolidate or dispose of our assets or the capital stock or assets of any subsidiary;\n\u00b7\npay dividends, make distributions or redeem capital stock;\n\u00b7\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates;\n\u00b7\nmake material changes or modifications to our organizational structure; and\n\u00b7\ngrant liens on our assets or the assets of our subsidiaries.\nOur revolving line of credit also includes certain affirmative covenants, including financial covenants requiring us to maintain minimum unencumbered liquid assets of $5 million, minimum shareholders\u2019 equity of $120 million and a maximum leverage percentage of 30%, in each case, as such terms are defined and calculated under the revolving line of credit. A breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our revolving line of credit, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 78211, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "UVE"}
