{"cik": "317540", "company": "COCA COLA BOTTLING CO CONSOLIDATED /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nIn addition to other information in this Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.\nThe Company may not be able to respond successfully to changes in the marketplace.\nThe Company operates in the highly competitive nonalcoholic beverage industry and faces strong competition from other general and specialty beverage companies. The Company\u2019s response to continued and increased customer and competitor consolidations and marketplace competition may result in lower than expected net pricing of the Company\u2019s products. The Company\u2019s ability to gain or maintain the Company\u2019s share of sales or gross margins may be limited by the actions of the Company\u2019s competitors, which may have advantages in setting their prices due to lower raw material costs. Competitive pressures in the markets in which the Company operates may cause channel and product mix to shift away from more profitable channels and packages. If the Company is unable to maintain or increase volume in higher-margin products and in packages sold through higher-margin channels (e.g., immediate consumption), pricing and gross margins could be adversely affected. The Company\u2019s efforts to improve pricing may result in lower than expected sales volume.\nChanges in how significant customers market or promote the Company\u2019s products could reduce revenue.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue is affected by how significant customers market or promote the Company\u2019s products. If the Company\u2019s significant customers change the manner in which they market or promote the Company\u2019s products, the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted.\nChanges in the Company\u2019s top customer relationships could impact revenues and profitability.\nThe Company is exposed to risks resulting from several large customers that account for a significant portion of its bottle/can volume and revenue. The Company\u2019s two largest customers accounted for approximately 29% of the Company\u2019s 2015 bottle/can volume to retail customers and approximately 20% of the Company\u2019s total net sales. The loss of one or both of these customers could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. These customers typically make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand and customer service performance and generally do not enter into long-term contracts. In addition, these significant customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices related to inventories, product displays, logistics or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. The Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected if revenue from one or more of these customers is significantly reduced or if the cost of complying with these customers\u2019 demands is significant. If receivables from one or more of these customers become uncollectible, the Company\u2019s results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nChanges in public and consumer preferences related to nonalcoholic beverages could reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products and reduce profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. The success of the Company\u2019s business depends in large measure on working with the Beverage Companies to meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. Health and wellness trends throughout the marketplace have resulted in a shift from sugar sparkling beverages to diet sparkling beverages, tea, sports drinks, enhanced water and bottled water over the past several years. Failure to satisfy changing consumer preferences, particularly those of young people, could adversely affect the profitability of the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s sales can be impacted by the health and stability of the general economy.\nUnfavorable changes in general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the geographic markets in which the Company does business, may have the temporary effect of reducing the demand for certain of the Company\u2019s products. For example, economic forces may cause consumers to shift away from purchasing higher-margin products and packages sold through immediate consumption and other highly profitable channels. Adverse economic conditions could also increase the likelihood of customer delinquencies and bankruptcies, which would increase the risk of uncollectibility of certain accounts. Each of these factors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenue, price realization, gross margins and overall financial condition and operating results.\nThe inability of the Company to successfully integrate the operations acquired in the Expansion Transactions and in any future Expansion Transactions into the Company\u2019s existing operations and implement the new contractual arrangements for the Expansion Transactions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company faces several potential risks relative to the Expansion Transactions including, without limitation, the Company\u2019s ability to successfully combine the Company\u2019s existing business with the distribution territories and manufacturing facilities acquired in the Expansion Transactions, including integrating production, distribution, sales and administrative support activities and information technology systems between the Company\u2019s Legacy Territory operations and the operations acquired in the Expansion Transactions; and the Company\u2019s ability to successfully operate in the Expansion Territories and to operate the Expansion Manufacturing Facilities. Other risks involve motivating, recruiting and retaining key employees; conforming standards, controls (including internal control over financial reporting, environmental compliance and health and safety compliance), procedures and policies and business cultures between the Company and the operations acquired in the Expansion Transactions; growing business with existing customers and attracting new customers; and other unanticipated problems and liabilities. The completed Expansion Transactions and any future expansion transactions also involve certain other financial and business risks, including that the Company might not realize a satisfactory return on the Company\u2019s investment, that the Company\u2019s assumptions regarding potential growth, synergies or cost savings could turn out to have been incorrect, or that the transactions divert key members of the Company\u2019s management\u2019s attention and other available resources from its existing business in the Legacy Territories.\nMiscalculation of the Company\u2019s need for infrastructure investment could impact the Company\u2019s financial results in both the Company\u2019s Legacy and Expansion Territories and any future expansion territories.\nProjected requirements of the Company\u2019s infrastructure investments in both the Company\u2019s Legacy and Expansion Territories and any future expansion territories may differ from actual levels if the Company\u2019s volume growth is not as the Company anticipates. The Company\u2019s infrastructure investments are generally long-term in nature; therefore, it is possible that investments made today may not generate the returns expected by the Company due to future changes in the marketplace. Significant changes from the Company\u2019s expected returns on cold drink equipment, fleet, technology and supply chain infrastructure investments could adversely affect the Company\u2019s consolidated financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to meet requirements under its beverage agreements could result in the loss of distribution rights.\nApproximately 87% of the Company\u2019s bottle/can volume to retail customers in 2015 consisted of products of The Coca-Cola Company, which is the sole supplier of these products or of the concentrates or syrups required to manufacture these products. The remaining 13% of the Company\u2019s bottle/can volume to retail customers in 2015 consisted of products of other beverage companies. The Company must satisfy various requirements under its beverage agreements, including the new CBAs for the Expansion Territories, which include additional obligations the Company must perform. Failure to satisfy these requirements could result in the loss of distribution rights for the respective products under one or more of these beverage agreements. The occurrence of other events defined in these agreements could also result in the termination of one or more beverage agreements.\nChanges in the inputs used to calculate the Company\u2019s acquisition related contingent consideration liability could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe acquisition related contingent consideration liability consists of the estimated amounts due to The Coca-Cola Company under the Comprehensive Beverage Agreements over the remaining useful life of the related distribution rights intangible assets. Changes in business conditions or other events could materially change both the projections of future cash flows and the discount rate used in the calculation of the fair value of contingent consideration under the Comprehensive Beverage Agreements. These changes could materially impact the fair value of the related contingent consideration and could materially impact the amount of noncash expense (or income) recorded each reporting period.\nDecreases from historic levels of marketing funding support could reduce the Company\u2019s profitability.\nMaterial changes in the performance requirements, or decreases in the levels of marketing funding support historically provided, under marketing programs with The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies, or the Company\u2019s inability to meet the performance requirements for the anticipated levels of such marketing funding support payments, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes in the levels of marketing funding support by the Beverage Companies, there can be no assurance that historic levels will continue.\nChanges in The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s and other beverage companies\u2019 levels of advertising, marketing spending and product innovation could reduce the Company\u2019s sales volume.\nThe Coca-Cola Company\u2019s and other beverage companies\u2019 levels of advertising, marketing spending and product innovation directly impact the Company\u2019s operations. While the Company does not believe there will be significant changes in the levels of marketing and advertising by the Beverage Companies, there can be no assurance that historic levels will continue. The Company\u2019s volume growth will also continue to be dependent on product innovation by the Beverage Companies, especially The Coca-Cola Company. Decreases in marketing, advertising and product innovation by the Beverage Companies could adversely impact the profitability of the Company.\nThe inability of the Company\u2019s aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Company\u2019s purchase requirements could reduce the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company currently obtains all of its aluminum cans from two domestic suppliers and all of its plastic bottles from two domestic cooperatives. The inability of these aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Company\u2019s requirements for containers could result in short-term shortages until alternative sources of supply can be located. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate. Failure of the aluminum can or plastic bottle suppliers to meet the Company\u2019s purchase requirements could reduce the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe inability of the Company to offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, increased bottle/can volume or reduced expenses could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s profitability.\nRaw material costs, including the costs for plastic bottles, aluminum cans and high fructose corn syrup, have been subject to significant price volatility in the past and may continue to be in the future. In addition, there are no limits on the prices The Coca-Cola Company and other beverage companies can charge for concentrate. If the Company cannot offset higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, increased sales volume or reductions in other costs, the Company\u2019s profitability could be adversely affected.\nThe consolidation among suppliers of certain of the Company\u2019s raw materials could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s profitability.\nIn recent years, there has been consolidation among suppliers of certain of the Company\u2019s raw materials. The reduction in the number of competitive sources of supply could have an adverse effect upon the Company\u2019s ability to negotiate the lowest costs and, in light of the Company\u2019s relatively small in-plant raw material inventory levels, has the potential for causing interruptions in the Company\u2019s supply of raw materials.\nThe reliance on purchased finished goods from external sources makes the Company subject to incremental risks that could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s profitability.\nAlthough the Company has purchased manufacturing assets and plans to continue to purchase additional manufacturing assets in the future, the Company remains reliant on purchased finished goods from external sources versus the Company\u2019s internal production. As a result, the Company is subject to incremental risk including, but not limited to, product availability, price variability, and product quality and production capacity shortfalls for externally purchased finished goods. The Company\u2019s operations in the Expansion Territories are more exposed to this risk than the Company\u2019s operations in the Legacy Territories because, with exceptions under which the Company may produce finished goods itself and for exceptions relating to Expansion Manufacturing Facilities acquired by the Company that have served the Expansion Territories, the Company is required under the CBAs for the Expansion Territories to purchase finished goods from CCR and other authorized external sources in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Finished Goods Supply Agreement entered into by the Company at the closing of each Expansion Territory transaction in quantities required to satisfy fully the demand for beverages and related products the Company is authorized under the CBAs to distribute in the Expansion Territory.\nThe Company\u2019s participation in the National Product Supply Group (the \u201cNPSG\u201d) may create additional risk because we will not exercise sole decision making authority over national product supply system issues that affect the Company and other members of the NPSG Board may have different interests than we do.\nPursuant to the NPSG Governance Agreement, the Company has agreed to abide by decisions made by the NPSG governing board (the \u201cNPSG Board\u201d) that are made in accordance with the governance processes and principles outlined in the NPSG Governance Charter that is part of the NPSG Agreement. Even though the Company will be a member of the NPSG Board, the Company will not exercise sole decision-making authority relating to the decisions of the NPSG Board, and the interests of other members of the NPSG Board may diverge from those of the Company. These may include decisions made to benefit the Coca-Cola system as a whole but have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s profitability, including decisions regarding strategic investment and divestment, optimal national product supply sourcing and new product or packaging infrastructure planning.\nIncreases in fuel prices or the inability of the Company to secure adequate supplies of fuel could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company uses significant amounts of fuel in the distribution of its products. International or domestic geopolitical or other events could impact the supply and cost of fuel and could impact the timely delivery of the Company\u2019s products to its customers. While the Company is working to reduce fuel consumption and manage the Company\u2019s fuel costs, there can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in limiting the impact on the Company\u2019s business or future cost increases. The Company may use derivative instruments to hedge some or all of the Company\u2019s projected diesel fuel and gasoline purchases. These derivative instruments relate to fuel used in the Company\u2019s delivery fleet and other vehicles. Sustained upward pressure in these costs could reduce the profitability of the Company\u2019s operations.\nSustained increases in workers\u2019 compensation, employment practices and vehicle accident claims costs could reduce the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company uses various insurance structures to manage its workers\u2019 compensation, auto liability, medical and other insurable risks. These structures consist of retentions, deductibles, limits and a diverse group of insurers that serve to strategically transfer and mitigate the financial impact of losses. The Company uses commercial insurance for claims as a risk reduction strategy to minimize\ncatastrophic losses. Losses are accrued using assumptions and procedures followed in the insurance industry, adjusted for company-specific history and expectations. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases. Continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce the profitability of the Company\u2019s operations.\nSustained increases in the cost of employee benefits could reduce the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability is substantially affected by the cost of pension retirement benefits, postretirement medical benefits and current employees\u2019 medical benefits. In recent years, the Company has experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. Although the Company has actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance the Company will succeed in limiting future cost increases, and continued upward pressure in these costs could reduce the profitability of the Company\u2019s operations.\nProduct safety and quality concerns, including concerns related to perceived artificiality of ingredients, could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in large part on its ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all its products. The Company has rigorous product safety and quality standards. However, if beverage products taken to market are or become contaminated or adulterated, the Company may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which would cause its business to suffer. In addition, regulatory actions, activities by nongovernmental organizations and public debate and concerns about perceived negative safety and quality consequences of certain ingredients in the Company\u2019s products, such as non-nutritive sweeteners, may erode consumers\u2019 confidence in the safety and quality issues, whether or not justified, and could result in additional governmental regulations concerning the marketing and labeling of the Company\u2019s products, negative publicity, or actual or threatened legal actions, all of which could damage the reputation of the Company\u2019s products and may reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products.\nCybersecurity risks - technology failures or cyberattacks on the Company\u2019s systems could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and negatively impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company increasingly relies on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information. For example, the Company\u2019s production and distribution facilities, inventory management and driver handheld devices all utilize information technology to maximize efficiencies and minimize costs. Furthermore, a significant portion of the communication between personnel, customers and suppliers depends on information technology. Like most companies, the Company\u2019s information technology systems may be vulnerable to interruption due to a variety of events beyond the Company\u2019s control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. The Company may also experience difficulties integrating systems from Expansion Territories with those in its Legacy Territories. The Company has technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate the Company\u2019s risk to these vulnerabilities, but these measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to ensure that the Company\u2019s operations are not disrupted.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect the profitability of the Company.\nAs of February 28, 2016, only the Company\u2019s $450 million revolving credit facility was subject to changes in short-term interest rates. On February 28, 2016, the Company had $75.0 million outstanding borrowings on the $450 million revolving credit facility. If interest rates increase in the future, the Company\u2019s borrowing cost could increase, which could result in a reduction of the Company\u2019s overall profitability. The Company\u2019s pension and postretirement medical benefits costs are also subject to changes in interest rates. A decline in interest rates used to discount the Company\u2019s pension and postretirement medical liabilities could increase the cost of these benefits and increase the overall liability.\nThe level of the Company\u2019s debt could restrict the Company\u2019s operating flexibility and limit the Company\u2019s ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.\nAs of February 28, 2016, the Company had $753.6 million of debt and capital lease obligations. The Company\u2019s level of debt requires the Company to dedicate a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s future cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest, thereby reducing the funds available to the Company for other purposes. The Company\u2019s debt can negatively impact the Company\u2019s operations by (1) limiting the Company\u2019s ability and/or increasing the cost to obtain funding for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purpose, including funding the cash purchase price of future territory expansions; (2) increasing the Company\u2019s vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse industry conditions by limiting the Company\u2019s ability to react to changing economic and business conditions; and (3) exposing the Company to a risk that a significant decrease in cash flows from operations could make it difficult for the Company to meet the Company\u2019s debt service requirements.\nThe Company\u2019s credit ratings could be negatively impacted by changes to The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s credit ratings.\nThe Company\u2019s credit rating could be significantly impacted by capital management activities of The Coca-Cola Company and/or changes in the credit ratings of The Coca-Cola Company. A lower credit rating could significantly increase the Company\u2019s interest costs or could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing at acceptable interest rates or to refinance existing debt.\nChanges in legal contingencies could adversely impact the Company\u2019s future profitability.\nChanges from expectations for the resolution of outstanding legal claims and assessments could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition. In addition, the Company\u2019s failure to abide by laws, orders or other legal commitments could subject the Company to fines, penalties or other damages.\nLegislative changes that affect the Company\u2019s distribution, packaging and products could reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products or increase the Company\u2019s costs.\nThe Company\u2019s business model is dependent on the availability of the Company\u2019s various products and packages in multiple channels and locations to better satisfy the needs of the Company\u2019s customers and consumers. Laws that restrict the Company\u2019s ability to distribute products in schools and other venues, as well as laws that require deposits for certain types of packages or those that limit the Company\u2019s ability to design new packages or market certain packages, could negatively impact the financial results of the Company.\nIn addition, excise or other taxes imposed on the sale of certain of the Company\u2019s products by the federal government and certain state and local governments could cause consumers to shift away from purchasing products of the Company. If enacted, such taxes could materially affect the Company\u2019s business and financial results, particularly if they were enacted in a form that incorporated them into the shelf prices for the Company\u2019s products.\nSignificant additional labeling or warning requirements may inhibit sales of affected products.\nIn 2014 and again in 2015, the FDA proposed major changes to the nutrition labels required on all packaged foods and beverages, including those for most of the Company\u2019s products. If the proposed changes are adopted, the Company and its competitors will be required to make nutrition label updates, which include updating serving sizes, including information about total calories in a beverage product container and providing information about any added sugars or nutrients. If the pending FDA nutrition label changes proposed become final, they will increase the Company\u2019s costs and could inhibit sales of one or more of the Company\u2019s major products. The timeline for implementation of any final regulations adopted by the FDA regarding changes to required nutrition labels is currently expected to be a period of up to two years.\nChanges in income tax laws and increases in income tax rates could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes within the United States. The Company\u2019s annual income tax rate is based upon the Company\u2019s income and the federal tax laws and the various state tax laws within the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Increases in federal or state income tax rates and changes in federal or state tax laws could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial results.\nAdditional taxes resulting from tax audits could adversely impact the Company\u2019s future profitability.\nAn assessment of additional taxes resulting from audits of the Company\u2019s tax filings could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s profitability, cash flows and financial condition.\nNatural disasters and unfavorable weather could negatively impact the Company\u2019s future profitability.\nNatural disasters or unfavorable weather conditions in the geographic regions in which the Company does business could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s revenue and profitability. Unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for the Company\u2019s products and contribute to lower sales, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability for such periods. Prolonged drought conditions in the geographic regions in which the Company does business could lead to restrictions on the use of water, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to manufacture and distribute products and the Company\u2019s cost to do so.\nGlobal climate change or legal, regulatory, or market responses to such change could adversely impact the Company\u2019s future profitability.\nThere is some scientific sentiment that increased concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d) in the atmosphere may have been the dominant cause of observed warming of the earth\u2019s climate system since the mid-20th century, and that continued emission of GHGs could cause further warming and long-lasting changes in components of the global climate system, potentially increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. Changing weather patterns, along with the increased frequency or duration of extreme weather and climate events, such as an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events, could impact some of the Company\u2019s facilities and the availability or increase the cost of key raw materials that the Company uses to produce its products. In addition, the sale of the Company\u2019s products can be impacted by weather conditions and climate events.\nGrowing concern over the effects of climate change, including warming of the global climate system, has led to legislative and regulatory initiatives directed at limiting GHG emissions. For example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has proposed regulations under the Clean Air Act to reduce GHG emissions from existing coal-fired power plants that would require each state to submit a plan specifying how it would reduce GHG emissions from existing coal-fired power plants located within its borders. It is anticipated that when the states implement their plans they could lead to the eventual closing of many of these plants. These USEPA proposed regulations or future laws enacted or regulations adopted to limit GHG emissions that directly or indirectly affect the Company\u2019s production, distribution, packaging, cost of raw materials, fuel, ingredients and water could all impact the Company\u2019s business and financial results.\nIssues surrounding labor relations could adversely impact the Company\u2019s future profitability and/or its operating efficiency.\nApproximately 5% of the Company\u2019s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The inability to renegotiate subsequent agreements on satisfactory terms and conditions could result in work interruptions or stoppages, which could have a material impact on the profitability of the Company. Also, the terms and conditions of existing or renegotiated agreements could increase costs, or otherwise affect the Company\u2019s ability to fully implement operational changes to improve overall efficiency. One collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 25 of the Company\u2019s employees expired during 2015 and the Company entered into new agreements in 2015. Three collective bargaining agreement covering approximately 65 of the Company\u2019s employees will expire during 2016.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to change distribution methods and business practices could be negatively affected by Coca-Cola bottler system disputes within the United States.\nLitigation filed by some U.S. bottlers of Coca-Cola products indicates that disagreements may exist within the Coca-Cola bottler system concerning distribution methods and business practices. Although the litigation has been resolved, disagreements among various Coca-Cola bottlers could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to fully implement its business plans in the future.\nObesity and other health concerns may reduce demand for some of the Company\u2019s products.\nConsumers, public health officials, public health advocates and government officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the public health consequences associated with obesity, particularly among young people. The production and marketing of beverages are subject to the rules and regulations of the FDA and other federal, state and local health agencies. The FDA also regulates the labeling of containers under The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990. The Nutrition Facts label has not changed significantly since it was first introduced in 1994. In March 2014 and again in July 2015, the FDA proposed new rules that would result in major changes to nutrition labels on all food packages, including the packaging for the Company\u2019s products, that would, among other things, require those labels to display caloric counts in large type, reflect larger portion sizes and display on a separate line on the label the amount of sugars that are added to the product. If these proposed rules are adopted by the FDA, the Company expects to have up to two years to put the required labeling changes into effect on the packaging for the products it manufactures and distributes. In addition, some researchers, health advocates and dietary guidelines are encouraging consumers to reduce the consumption of sugar, including sugar sparkling beverages. Increasing public concern about these issues, possible new taxes and governmental regulations concerning the production, marketing, labeling or availability of the Company\u2019s beverages, and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against the Company or other companies in the same industry relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of sugar sparkling beverages may reduce demand for these beverages, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company has experienced public policy challenges regarding the sale of soft drinks in schools, particularly elementary, middle and high schools.\nA number of states have regulations restricting the sale of soft drinks and other foods in schools. Many of these restrictions have existed for several years in connection with subsidized meal programs in schools. The focus has more recently turned to the growing\nhealth, nutrition and obesity concerns of today\u2019s youth. The impact of restrictive legislation, if widely enacted, could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s products, image and reputation.\nIf the financing of any future territory or other acquisitions involves issuing additional equity securities, their issuance would be dilutive and could affect the market price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock.\nAcquisitions of the distribution and manufacturing assets of CCR in the Expansion Transactions completed to date have been financed with available cash, public debt issuance, or by draws on our revolving credit facility. The Company may fund any future distribution, manufacturing or other acquisition transactions through the use of existing cash, cash equivalents or investments, debt financing, including draws on the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility, the issuance of equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing. Any future acquisitions of additional distribution, manufacturing or other assets that are financed in whole or in part by issuing additional shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock would be dilutive, which could affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nProvisions in the Final CBA and the Final RMA with The Coca-Cola Company could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, which could adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.\nProvisions in the Final CBA and the Final RMA require the Company to obtain The Coca-Cola Company\u2019s prior approval of a potential buyer of the Company\u2019s Coca-Cola distribution or manufacturing related businesses, which could delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or the ability of the Company to sell such businesses. The Company annually can obtain a list of approved third party buyers from The Coca-Cola Company or, upon receipt of a third party offer to purchase the Company or its Coca-Cola related business, may seek approval of such buyer by The Coca-Cola Company. In addition, the Final CBA and the Final RMA contain a sale process provision that would apply if the Company notifies The Coca-Cola Company that it wishes to sell the distribution or manufacturing business to The Coca-Cola Company, which process includes default terms and conditions of sale and a third party valuation should the Company and The Coca-Cola Company choose to use them. The Final CBA and the Final RMA also include terms that would apply in the event The Coca-Cola Company terminates the Final CBA or the Final RMA following the Company\u2019s default thereunder.\nThe concentration of the Company\u2019s capital stock ownership with the Harrison family limits other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters.\nMembers of the Harrison family, including the Company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J. Frank Harrison, III, beneficially own shares of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing approximately 86% of the total voting power of the Company\u2019s outstanding capital stock. In addition, three members of the Harrison family, including Mr. Harrison, serve on the Board of Directors of the Company. As a result, members of the Harrison family have the ability to exert substantial influence or actual control over the Company\u2019s management and affairs and over substantially all matters requiring action by the Company\u2019s stockholders. Additionally, as a result of the Harrison family\u2019s significant beneficial ownership of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting stock, the Company has relied on the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption from certain corporate governance requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control otherwise favored by the Company\u2019s other stockholders and could depress the stock price. It also limits other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, the Company may take actions that the Company\u2019s other stockholders may not view as beneficial.", "PERMNO": 11995, "SIC": 2086, "TIC": "COKE"}
