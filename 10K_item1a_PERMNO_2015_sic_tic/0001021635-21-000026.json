{"cik": "1021635", "company": "OGE ENERGY CORP.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn the discussion of risk factors set forth below, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms \"we,\" \"our\" and \"us\" refer to the Registrants. In addition to the other information in this Form 10-K and other documents filed by us and/or our subsidiaries with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, the following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating OGE Energy and its subsidiaries. Such factors could affect actual results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us or our subsidiaries. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nThe Registrants are subject to a variety of risks which can be classified as regulatory, operational, financial and general. Risk factors of OG&E are also risk factors of OGE Energy. OGE Energy also is subject to risks associated with its investment in Enable.\nREGULATORY RISKS\nThe Registrants' profitability depends to a large extent on the ability of OG&E to fully recover its costs, including its cost of capital, from its customers in a timely manner, and there may be changes in the regulatory environment that impair its ability to recover costs from its customers.\nOG&E is subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal and state utility regulatory agencies, which significantly influences its operating environment and its ability to fully recover its costs, including its cost of capital, from utility customers. Recoverability of any under recovered amounts from OG&E's customers due to a rise in fuel costs is a significant risk, such as experienced in February 2021 due to the unprecedented, prolonged, cold spell that resulted in winter record winter peak demand for electricity in OG&E's service territory and extreme natural gas and purchased power prices. The utility commissions in the states where OG&E operates regulate many aspects of its utility operations including siting and construction of facilities, customer service and the rates that OG&E can charge customers. The profitability of the utility operations is dependent on OG&E's ability to fully recover costs related to providing energy and utility services to its customers in a timely manner. Any failure to obtain utility commission approval to increase rates to fully recover costs, or a delay in the receipt of such approval, could have an adverse impact on OG&E's results of operations. In addition, OG&E's jurisdictions have fuel adjustment clauses that permit OG&E to recover fuel costs through rates without a general rate review, subject to a later determination that such fuel costs were prudently incurred. If the state regulatory commissions determine that the fuel costs were not prudently incurred, recovery could be disallowed. See Note 16 within \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" for further discussion of the significant fuel and purchased power costs incurred during the February 2021 weather event and the related regulatory filing with the OCC.\nIn recent years, the regulatory environments in which OG&E operates have received an increased amount of attention. It is possible that there could be changes in the regulatory environment that would impair OG&E's ability to fully recover costs historically paid by OG&E's customers. State utility commissions generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are being met. OG&E cannot assure that the OCC, APSC and the FERC will grant rate increases in the future or in the amounts requested, and they could instead lower OG&E's rates.\nThe Registrants are unable to predict the impact on their operating results from future regulatory activities of any of the agencies that regulate OG&E. Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on the Registrants' results of operations.\nOG&E's rates are subject to rate regulation by the states of Oklahoma and Arkansas, as well as by a federal agency, whose regulatory paradigms and goals may not be consistent.\nOG&E is a vertically integrated electric utility. Most of its revenue results from the sale of electricity to retail customers subject to bundled rates that are approved by the applicable state utility commission.\nOG&E operates in Oklahoma and western Arkansas and is subject to rate regulation by the OCC and the APSC, in addition to FERC regulation of its transmission activities and any wholesale sales. Exposure to inconsistent state and federal regulatory standards may limit our ability to operate profitably. Further alteration of the regulatory landscape in which we operate, including a change in our authorized return on equity, may harm our financial position and results of operations.\nCosts of compliance with environmental laws and regulations are significant, and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, wildlife conservation, natural resources and health and safety that could, among other things, restrict or limit the output of certain facilities or the use of certain fuels required for the production of electricity and/or require additional pollution control equipment and otherwise increase costs. There are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules and regulations and those costs may be even more significant in the future.\nIn response to recent regulatory and judicial decisions and international accords, emissions of greenhouse gases including, most significantly, CO2, could be restricted in the future as a result of federal or state legal requirements or litigation relating to greenhouse gas emissions. No rules are currently in effect that require us to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, but if such rules were to become effective, they could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect our future financial position, results of operations and cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.\nThere is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in our operations and historical industry practices. These activities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that can restrict or impact OG&E's business activities in many ways, such as restricting the way OG&E can handle or dispose of its wastes or requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions that may be caused by its operations or that are attributable to former operators. OG&E may be unable to recover these costs from insurance or other regulatory mechanisms. We expect that the Biden administration will enact stricter laws, regulations and enforcement policies that could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. If regulations are enacted regarding any of our generating units, it could potentially result in stranded assets.\nFor further discussion of environmental matters that may affect the Registrants, see \"Environmental Laws and Regulations\" within \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nWe may not be able to recover the costs of our substantial investments in capital improvements and additions.\nOur business plan calls for extensive investments in capital improvements and additions in OG&E, including modernizing existing infrastructure as well as other initiatives. Significant portions of OG&E's facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generation equipment, even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices, may require significant capital expenditures to maintain efficiency, to comply with environmental requirements or to provide reliable operations. OG&E currently provides service at rates approved by one or more regulatory commissions. If these regulatory commissions do not approve adjustments to the rates OG&E charges, it would not be able to recover the costs associated with its planned extensive investment. This could adversely affect the Registrants' financial position and results of operations. While OG&E may seek to limit the impact of any denied recovery by attempting to reduce the scope of its capital investment, there can be no assurance as to the effectiveness of any such mitigation efforts, particularly with respect to previously incurred costs and commitments.\nThe regional power market in which OG&E operates has changing transmission regulatory structures, which may affect the transmission assets and related revenues and expenses.\nOG&E currently owns and operates transmission and generation facilities as part of a vertically integrated utility. OG&E is a member of the SPP regional transmission organization and has transferred operational authority (but not ownership) of OG&E's transmission facilities to the SPP. The SPP has implemented regional day ahead and real-time markets for energy and operating reserves, as well as associated transmission congestion rights. Collectively, the three markets operate together under the global name, SPP Integrated Marketplace. OG&E represents owned and contracted generation assets and customer load in the SPP Integrated Marketplace for the sole benefit of its customers. OG&E has not participated in the SPP Integrated Marketplace for any speculative trading activities. We record the SPP Integrated Marketplace transactions as sales or purchases with results reported as Revenues from Contracts with Customers or Cost of Sales in its financial statements. Our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities may be adversely affected by changes in the organization, operation and regulation of the SPP Integrated Marketplace by the FERC or the SPP.\nIncreased competition resulting from efforts to restructure utility and energy markets could have a significant financial impact on us and consequently impact our revenue.\nWe have been and will continue to be affected by competitive changes to the utility and energy industries. Significant changes have occurred and additional changes have been proposed to the wholesale electric market. Although retail restructuring efforts in Oklahoma and Arkansas have been postponed for the time being, if such efforts were renewed, retail competition and the unbundling of regulated energy service could have a significant financial impact on us due to possible impairments of assets, a loss of retail customers, impact profit margins and/or increased costs of capital. Any such restructuring could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot predict when we will be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, nor can we predict the impact of these changes on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are subject to substantial utility and energy regulation by governmental agencies. Compliance with current and future utility and energy regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary approvals, permits and certifications may result in significant costs to us.\nWe are subject to substantial regulation from federal, state and local regulatory agencies. We are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and to obtain permits, approvals and certifications from the governmental agencies that regulate various aspects of our businesses, including customer rates, service regulations, retail service territories, sales of securities, asset acquisitions and sales, accounting policies and practices and the operation of generating facilities. We believe the necessary permits, approvals and certificates have been obtained for our existing operations and that our business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws; however, we are unable to predict the impact on our operating results from future regulatory activities of these agencies.\nThe NERC is responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory reliability and cyber security standards for the wholesale electric power system. OG&E's plan is to comply with all applicable standards and to expediently correct a violation should it occur. As one of OG&E's regulators, the NERC has comprehensive regulations and standards related to the reliability and security of our operating systems and is continuously developing additional mandatory compliance requirements for the utility industry. The increasing development of NERC rules and standards will increase compliance costs and our exposure for potential violations of these standards.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nOur results of operations may be impacted by disruptions to fuel supply or the electric grid that are beyond our control.\nWe are exposed to risks related to performance of contractual obligations by our suppliers. We are dependent on coal and natural gas for much of our electric generating capacity. We rely on suppliers to deliver coal and natural gas in accordance with short- and long-term contracts. We have certain supply contracts in place; however, there can be no assurance that the counterparties to these agreements will fulfill their obligations to supply coal and natural gas to us. The suppliers under these agreements may experience financial or technical problems that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. In addition, the suppliers under these agreements may not be required to supply coal and natural gas to us under certain circumstances, such as in the event of a natural disaster. Deliveries may be subject to short-term interruptions or reductions due to various factors, including transportation problems, weather and availability of equipment. Failure or delay by our suppliers of coal and natural gas deliveries could disrupt our ability to deliver electricity and require us to incur additional expenses to meet the needs of our customers.\nAlso, because our generation and transmission systems are part of an interconnected regional grid, we face the risk of possible loss of business due to a disruption or black-out caused by an event such as a severe storm, generator or transmission facility outage on a neighboring system or the actions of a neighboring utility. Any such disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair assets, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOG&E's electric generation, transmission and distribution assets are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses, increased purchase power costs, accidents and third-party liability.\nOG&E owns and operates coal-fired, natural gas-fired, wind-powered and solar-powered generating assets. Operation of electric generation, transmission and distribution assets involves risks that can adversely affect energy output and efficiency\nlevels or that could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution and impairment of OG&E's operations. Included among these risks are:\n\u2022increased prices for fuel and fuel transportation as existing contracts expire;\n\u2022facility shutdowns due to a breakdown or failure of equipment or processes or interruptions in fuel supply;\n\u2022operator error or safety related stoppages;\n\u2022disruptions in the delivery of electricity; and\n\u2022catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes or other similar occurrences.\nThe occurrence of any of these events, if not fully covered by insurance, could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. Further, when unplanned maintenance work is required on power plants or other equipment, OG&E will not only incur unexpected maintenance expenses, but it may also have to make spot market purchases of replacement electricity that could exceed OG&E's costs of generation or be forced to retire a generation unit if the cost or timing of the maintenance is not reasonable and prudent. If OG&E is unable to recover any of these increased costs in rates, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nChanges in technology, regulatory policies and customer electricity consumption may cause our assets to be less competitive and impact our results of operations.\nOG&E primarily generates electricity at large central facilities. This method typically results in economies of scale and lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells, microturbines, windmills and photovoltaic solar cells. It is possible that advances in technologies or changes in regulatory policies will reduce costs of new technology to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. OG&E's widespread use of Smart Grid technology allowing for two-way communications between the utility and its customers could enable the entry of technology companies into the interface between OG&E and its customers, resulting in unpredictable effects on our current business.\nReductions in customer electricity consumption, thereby reducing utility electric sales, could result from increased deployment of renewable energy technologies as well as increased efficiency of household appliances, among other general efficiency gains in technology. However, this potential reduction in load would not reduce our need for ongoing investments in our infrastructure to reliably serve our customers. Continued utility infrastructure investment without increased electricity sales could cause increased rates for customers, potentially resulting in further reductions in electricity sales and reduced profitability.\nWeather conditions such as tornadoes, thunderstorms, ice storms, wind storms, flooding, earthquakes, prolonged droughts and the occurrence of wildfires, as well as seasonal temperature variations may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electric power. In OG&E's service area, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also typically peaking at that time. As a result, overall operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis. In addition, we have historically sold less power, and consequently received less revenue, when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce our revenues, net income, available cash and borrowing ability. Severe weather, such as tornadoes, thunderstorms, ice storms, wind storms, flooding, earthquakes, prolonged droughts and the occurrence of wildfires, may cause outages and property damage which may require us to incur additional costs that are generally not insured and that may not be recoverable from customers. The effect of the failure of our facilities to operate as planned, as described above, would be particularly burdensome during a peak demand period. In addition, prolonged droughts could cause a lack of sufficient water for use in cooling during the electricity generating process. Additionally, if climate change exacerbates physical changes in weather, operations may be impacted as discussed above. OG&E can incur significant restoration costs as a result of these weather events. If OG&E is unable to recover any of these increased costs in rates, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nMarket performance, increased retirements, changes in retirement plan regulations and increasing costs associated with our Pension Plan, health care plans and other employee-related benefits may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe have a Pension Plan that covers a significant amount of our employees hired before December 1, 2009. We also have defined benefit postretirement plans that cover a significant amount of our employees hired prior to February 1,\n2000. Assumptions related to future costs, returns on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions with respect to the defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans have a significant impact on our results of operations and funding requirements. Based on our assumptions at December 31, 2020, we expect to make future contributions to maintain required funding levels. It has been our practice to also make voluntary contributions to maintain more prudent funding levels than minimally required. We may continue to make voluntary contributions in the future. These amounts are estimates and may change based on actual stock market performance, changes in interest rates and any changes in governmental regulations.\nIf the employees who participate in the Pension Plan retire when they become eligible for retirement over the next several years, or if our plan experiences adverse market returns on its investments, or if interest rates materially fall, our pension expense and contributions to the plans could rise substantially over historical levels. The timing and number of employees retiring and selecting the lump-sum payment option could result in pension settlement charges that could materially affect our results of operations if we are unable to recover these costs through our electric rates. In addition, assumptions related to future costs, returns on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions, including projected retirements, have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. Those factors are outside of our control.\nIn addition to the costs of our Pension Plan, the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased in recent years. We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs related to health care plans for our employees, will continue to rise. The increasing costs and funding requirements with our Pension Plan, health care plans and other employee benefits may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nFinally, OGE Energy provides retirement benefits and retiree health care benefits to 76 employees seconded to Enable. If the seconding agreement was terminated, and those employees were no longer employed by OGE Energy, and lump sum payments were made to those employees, OGE Energy would recognize a settlement or curtailment of the pension/retiree health care charges, which would increase expense at OGE Energy by $19.0 million. Settlement and curtailment charges associated with the Enable seconded employees are not reimbursable to OGE Energy by Enable. The seconding agreement can be terminated by mutual agreement of OGE Energy and Enable or solely by OGE Energy upon 120 days' notice. Assuming the pending merger between Enable and Energy Transfer is completed, the seconding agreement will be terminated.\nOGE Energy is a holding company with its primary assets being investments in its subsidiary and equity investments.\nOGE Energy is a holding company and thus its investments in its subsidiary and unconsolidated affiliate, accounted for under the equity method, are its primary assets. Substantially all of OGE Energy's operations are conducted by its subsidiary and unconsolidated affiliate. Consequently, OGE Energy's operating cash flow and its ability to pay dividends and service its indebtedness utilizes the operating cash flow of its subsidiary and unconsolidated affiliate and the payment of funds by them to OGE Energy in the form of dividends or distributions. At December 31, 2020, OGE Energy and OG&E had outstanding indebtedness and other liabilities of $7.1 billion. OGE Energy's subsidiary, OG&E, and unconsolidated affiliate, Enable, are separate legal entities that have no obligation to pay any amounts due on OGE Energy's indebtedness or to make any funds available for that purpose, whether by dividends or otherwise. In addition, their ability to pay dividends to OGE Energy depends on any statutory and contractual restrictions that may be applicable to such subsidiary, which may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of working capital and other assets. Claims of creditors, including general creditors, of OGE Energy's subsidiary or unconsolidated affiliate on their respective assets will generally have priority over OGE Energy claims (except to the extent that OGE Energy may be a creditor of the subsidiaries and its claims are recognized) and claims by OGE Energy shareholders.\nIn addition, as discussed above, OG&E is regulated by state utility commissions in Oklahoma and Arkansas as well as a federal regulatory agency which generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are being met. To the extent that the state commissions or federal regulatory agency attempt to impose restrictions on the ability of OG&E to pay dividends to OGE Energy, it could adversely affect its ability to continue to pay dividends.\nRISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OGE ENERGY'S INVESTMENT IN ENABLE\nOGE Energy does not control Enable and therefore is not able to cause or prevent certain actions by Enable. The general partnership of Enable is equally controlled by OGE Energy and CenterPoint.\nEnable has its own governing board; therefore, OGE Energy is not able to exercise control over Enable. Accordingly, OGE Energy is unable to cause or prevent certain actions by Enable. Further, OGE Energy cannot control the actions of the other general partner, CenterPoint. OGE Energy's interests may not align with those of CenterPoint, and this lack of control could adversely impact its investment in Enable.\nAs discussed in \"Item 1. Business,\" in February 2021, Enable entered into a definitive merger agreement with Energy Transfer. Assuming the transaction closes, OGE Energy will own approximately three percent of Energy Transfer's outstanding limited partner units in lieu of the 25.5 percent interest in Enable that it currently owns, which would result in OGE Energy having less control over the activities of its expected investment in Energy Transfer. Further, although OGE Energy does not control Enable, OGE Energy has a 50 percent interest in Enable's general partner and is able to designate two directors for the Enable board. Following completion of the merger, OGE Energy will not have any interest in the general partner and will not have any designees on the Energy Transfer board. Accordingly, OGE Energy will be unable to cause, prevent or influence actions by Energy Transfer.\nA portion of OGE Energy's earnings and operating cash flows are based on the performance of Enable. If any of the following risks were to occur, OGE Energy's business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOGE Energy's operating cash flow is derived partially from cash distributions it receives from Enable.\nOGE Energy's operating cash flow is derived partially from cash distributions it receives from Enable. The amount of cash Enable can distribute on its units principally depends upon the amount of cash generated from its operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:\n\u2022the fees and gross margins it realizes with respect to the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil that it handles;\n\u2022the prices of, levels of production of, and demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;\n\u2022the volume of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil it gathers, compresses, treats, dehydrates, processes, fractionates, transports and stores;\n\u2022the relationship among prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;\n\u2022cash calls and settlements of hedging positions;\n\u2022margin requirements on open price risk management assets and liabilities;\n\u2022the level of competition from other companies offering midstream services;\n\u2022adverse effects of governmental and environmental regulation;\n\u2022the level of its operation and maintenance expenses and general and administrative costs; and\n\u2022prevailing economic conditions.\nIn addition, the actual amount of cash Enable will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, including:\n\u2022the level and timing of capital expenditures it makes;\n\u2022the cost of acquisitions;\n\u2022its debt service requirements and other liabilities;\n\u2022fluctuations in working capital needs;\n\u2022its ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;\n\u2022restrictions contained in its debt agreements;\n\u2022the amount of cash reserves established by its general partner;\n\u2022distributions paid on its Series A Preferred Units; and\n\u2022other business risks affecting its cash levels.\nEnable's contracts are subject to renewal risks.\nAs contracts with Enable's existing suppliers and customers expire, Enable generally seeks to negotiate extensions or renewals of those contracts or enters into new contracts with other suppliers and customers. Enable may be unable to extend or renew existing contracts or enter into new contracts on favorable commercial terms, if at all. Depending on prevailing market conditions at the time of an extension or renewal, gathering and processing customers with fee-based contracts may desire to enter into contracts under different fee arrangements, and gathering and processing customers with contracts that contain minimum volume commitments may desire to enter into contracts without minimum volume commitments. Likewise, Enable's transportation and storage customers may choose not to extend or renew expiring contracts based on the economics of the related areas of production. To the extent Enable is unable to renew or replace its expiring contracts on terms that are favorable to Enable, if at all, or successfully manage its overall contract mix over time, its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy, could be adversely affected.\nThe businesses of Enable are dependent, in part, on the drilling and production decisions of others. In response to sharp declines in demand for oil and gas as well as commodity prices resulting from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, many producers have significantly reduced previously anticipated drilling and production activities and may make additional reductions in the future.\nThe businesses of Enable are dependent on the drilling and production of natural gas and crude oil. Enable has no control over the level of drilling activity in its areas of operation, or the amount of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves associated with wells connected to its systems, or the amount of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil produced from the wells connected to its systems. In addition, as the rate at which production from wells currently connected to its system naturally declines over time, its gross margin associated with those wells will also decline. To maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation systems and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants, its customers must continually obtain new natural gas, NGLs and crude oil supplies. Drilling activity in the areas served by our systems significantly impacts Enable's ability to obtain new volumes of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil on its systems. If Enable is not able to obtain new volumes of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells, throughput on its gathering, processing, transportation and storage facilities would decline, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy. Enable has no control over producers or their drilling and production decisions, which are affected by, among other things:\n\u2022the availability and cost of capital;\n\u2022prevailing and projected commodity prices, including the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;\n\u2022demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil;\n\u2022levels of reserves;\n\u2022geological considerations;\n\u2022global or national health events, including epidemics and pandemics such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022environmental or other governmental regulations, including the availability of drilling permits, the regulation of hydraulic fracturing and the regulation of air emissions; and\n\u2022the availability of drilling rigs and other costs of production and equipment.\nFluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new natural gas, NGLs and crude oil reserves. Drilling and production activity generally decreases as commodity prices decrease. In general terms, the prices of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond its control. Because of these and other factors, even if new reserves are known to exist in areas served by Enable's assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. Declines in natural gas, NGLs or crude oil prices can have a negative impact on exploration, development and production activity and, if sustained, could lead to decreases in such activity. For instance, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected Enable's business by (i) reducing the demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil due to reduced global and national economic activity, leading to significantly lower prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, (ii) impairing the supply chain of certain Enable customers for which it provides gathering and processing services, which could lead to further reduction of the utilization of Enable's systems, and (iii) reducing producer activity across Enable's footprint, which is expected to continue to result in reduced utilization of its services. Enable currently cannot predict the duration or magnitude of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on supply and demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil or the exploration, development and production activity of the producers across its areas of operation. In addition, concerns about global economic growth, as well as uncertainty regarding the timing, pace and extent of an economic recovery in the U.S. and abroad, have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices, and sustained low natural gas, NGLs or crude oil prices could also lead producers to shut in production from their existing wells. Sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in its areas of operation could lead to further reductions in the utilization of its systems, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders, including OGE Energy, and result in the impairment of its assets.\nIn addition, it may be more difficult to maintain or increase the current volumes on its gathering systems and in its processing plants, as several of the formations in the unconventional resource plays in which Enable operates generally have higher initial production rates and steeper production decline curves than wells in more conventional basins. Should Enable determine that the economics of its gathering assets do not justify the capital expenditures needed to grow or maintain volumes associated therewith, it may reduce such capital expenditures, which could cause revenues associated with these assets to decline over time.\nEnable's industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nEnable competes with other midstream service providers in its areas of operation. The principal elements of competition for both gathering and processing services and transportation and storage services are rates, terms of service, flexibility and reliability. Competitors include other midstream service providers, including those affiliated with producers, that may have greater financial resources or greater access to new volumes of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil than Enable does. Some of these competitors may create additional competition by expanding existing or constructing new gathering, processing, transportation and storage systems. Enable's producer customers may become competitors by developing their own midstream systems. Excess gathering, processing, transportation or storage capacity in the areas Enable serves may increase competitive pressure by decreasing rates and adversely impact the ability to renew existing or enter into new contracts. Natural gas, NGLs and crude oil used as or to produce fuel compete with other forms of energy, including electricity and coal. Increased demand for one form of energy over another could lead to a reduction in demand for associated midstream services. All of these competitive pressures could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nNatural gas, NGLs and crude oil prices are volatile, and changes in these prices could adversely affect Enable's financial position, results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy. Prices for all three of these commodities have been adversely affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with crude oil prices reaching historic lows in April 2020.\nEnable's financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to OGE Energy could be negatively affected by adverse changes in the prices of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil depending on factors that are beyond its control. These factors include demand for these commodities, which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors, including the impact of seasonality and weather, general economic conditions, the level of domestic and offshore natural gas production and consumption, the availability of imported natural gas, liquefied natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, actions taken by foreign natural gas and oil producing nations, the availability of local, intrastate and interstate transportation systems, the availability and marketing of competitive fuels, the impact of energy conservation efforts, technological advances affecting energy consumption, global or national health concerns and the extent of governmental regulation and taxation. For example, the price of, and demand for, natural gas, NGLs and crude oil declined significantly in response to the ongoing spread and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, travel restrictions and business shutdowns and Russia's March 2020 rejection of a plan backed by Saudi Arabia and other members of OPEC to reduce production of crude oil in response to declining global demand. Following the rejection of the plan, Saudi Arabia significantly reduced the prices at which it sells crude oil, and both Saudi Arabia and Russia announced plans to increase production. While a coalition of 23 nations led by Saudi Arabia and Russia subsequently agreed to reduce production of crude oil by 9.7 million barrels per day in May and June of 2020, NGLs and crude oil prices have remained depressed. These events, combined with the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty regarding the length of time it will take for the U.S. and the rest of the world to slow the spread of COVID-19 to the point where applicable authorities are comfortable easing current restrictions on various commercial and economic activities, contributed to a sharp drop in prices for crude oil in the first and second quarters of 2020.\nEnable's natural gas processing arrangements expose Enable to commodity price fluctuations. In 2020, 6 percent, 33 percent and 61 percent of Enable's processing plant inlet volumes consisted of keep-whole arrangements, percent-of-proceeds or percent-of-liquids and fee-based, respectively. If the price at which Enable sells natural gas or NGLs is less than the cost at which it purchases natural gas or NGLs under these arrangements, then its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy, could be adversely affected. Enable uses certain derivative instruments to manage its commodity price risk exposures.\nAt any given time, Enable's overall portfolio of processing contracts may reflect a net short position in natural gas (meaning that it is a net buyer of natural gas) and a net long position in NGLs (meaning that it is a net seller of NGLs). As a result, Enable's financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy, could be adversely affected to the extent the price of NGLs decreases in relation to the price of natural gas.\nA pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may materially adversely affect Enable's business.\nA global or national pandemic, such as COVID-19, may cause disruptions to Enable's business and operational plans, which may include (i) shortages of employees, (ii) unavailability of contractors and subcontractors, (iii) interruption of supplies\nfrom third parties upon which Enable relies, (iv) recommendations of, or restrictions imposed by, government and health authorities, including quarantines, travel restrictions and business shutdowns, to address the COVID-19 pandemic and (v) restrictions that Enable and its contractors and subcontractors impose, including facility shutdowns, to ensure the safety of employees and others. For example, many of Enable's employees have been temporarily required to work remotely which may disrupt Enable's operations or increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident. While it is not possible to predict their extent or duration, these disruptions may have a material adverse effect on Enable's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and concerns regarding its continued global spread have negatively impacted domestic and international demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, which has and could continue to contribute to price volatility and materially and adversely affect Enable's customers' operations and future production, resulting in less demand for Enable's services and/or the reduction of commercial opportunities that might otherwise be available to Enable. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have also negatively impacted domestic and international economic conditions, which has and could continue to contribute to price declines and volatility in the financial markets. While it is not possible to predict their extent or duration, these economic conditions could materially and adversely affect the availability of debt or equity financing to Enable, which may result in a significant reduction of Enable's liquidity.\nEnable provides certain transportation and storage services under fixed-price \"negotiated rate\" contracts that are not subject to adjustment, even if the cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts, and, as a result, costs could exceed revenues received under such contracts.\nEnable has been authorized by the FERC to provide transportation and storage services at its facilities at negotiated rates. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 37 percent of Enable's aggregate contracted firm transportation capacity on EGT and MRT and 52 percent of its aggregate contracted firm storage capacity on EGT and MRT was subscribed under such \"negotiated rate\" contracts. These contracts generally do not include provisions allowing for adjustment for increased costs due to inflation, pipeline safety activities or other factors that are not tied to an applicable tracking mechanism authorized by the FERC. Successful recovery of any shortfall of revenue, representing the difference between \"recourse rates\" (if higher) and negotiated rates, is not assured under current FERC policies. If Enable's costs increase and it is not able to recover any shortfall of revenue associated with its negotiated rate contracts, the cash flow realized by its systems could decrease and, therefore, the cash Enable has available for distribution to its unitholders, including OGE Energy, could also decrease.\nIf third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to Enable's gathering, processing or transportation facilities become partially or fully unavailable to Enable for any reason, Enable's financial position, results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy, could be adversely affected.\nEnable depends upon (i) third-party pipelines to deliver natural gas to, and take natural gas from, its natural gas transportation systems, (ii) third-party pipelines and other facilities to take crude oil, condensate and produced water from its crude oil, condensate and produced water gathering systems, and, in some cases, (iii) third-party facilities to process natural gas from its gathering systems. It also depends on third-party facilities to transport and fractionate NGLs that are delivered to the third party at the tailgates of its processing plants. Fractionation is the separation of the heterogeneous mixture of extracted NGLs into individual components for end-use sale. An outage or disruption on certain pipelines or fractionators operated by a third party could result in the shutdown of certain of Enable's processing plants and gathering systems, and a prolonged outage or disruption could ultimately result in a reduction in the volume of natural gas Enable gathers and NGLs it is able to produce. For example, substantially all of the crude oil gathered by Enable's Williston Basin systems is delivered indirectly for transport to the Dakota Access Pipeline. Although the crude oil gathered by Enable's Williston Basin crude oil systems may also be delivered for transport to other pipelines, such as BakkenLink Pipeline and Enbridge North Dakota Pipeline, a shutdown of Dakota Access Pipeline, or any other significant pipeline providing transportation services from the Williston Basin, could result in the shut-in of wells connected to Enable's Williston Basin crude oil systems if its customers are unable to obtain sufficient capacity on those pipelines at an effective cost. In July 2020, the federal district court for the District of Columbia vacated the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' grant of an easement to Dakota Access Pipeline and issued an order requiring Dakota Access Pipeline to be shut down and emptied of crude oil by August 5, 2020, pending the completion of an environmental impact analysis for the pipeline. In January 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit affirmed the district court's decision that the Corps of Engineers did not follow proper procedures to grant the easement but reversed the district court's order requiring the pipeline to shut down. It can continue operating while the Corp of Engineers attempts to cure the defects identified by the district court. Additionally, Enable depends on third parties to provide electricity for compression, pumping and other operational activities at many of its facilities. Since it does not own or operate any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities, continuing operation of those facilities is not within its control. If any of these third-party pipelines or other facilities become partially or fully unavailable to Enable for any reason, its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy, could be adversely affected.\nEnable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, which could disrupt its operations.\nEnable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities have been constructed, and it is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate. Enable may obtain the rights to construct and operate its pipelines for a specific period of time on lands owned by governmental agencies, American Indian tribes or other third parties, including on American Indian allotments, title to which is held in trust by the U.S. A loss of these rights, through its inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could cause a cease in operations temporarily or permanently on the affected land, increase costs related to the construction and continuing operations elsewhere, and adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nAn impairment of long-lived assets, including intangible assets or equity method investments could reduce Enable's earnings.\nLong-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment, are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment of long-lived assets is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. Due to decreases in natural gas and NGL market prices during 2020 as a result of the economic effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, together with the dispute over crude oil production levels between Russia and members of OPEC led by Saudi Arabia, as of March 31, 2020, Enable reassessed the carrying value of the Atoka assets, in which it owns a 50 percent interest in the consolidated joint venture, which is a component of Enable's gathering and processing segment. Based on forecasted future undiscounted cash flows, Enable determined that the carrying value of the Atoka assets were not fully recoverable and recognized a $16 million impairment for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nEquity method investments are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment might not be recoverable. An impairment of an equity method investment is recognized if the fair value of the investment as a whole, and not the underlying assets, has declined and the decline is other than temporary. An example of an investment that Enable accounts for under the equity method is its investment in SESH. If Enable enters into additional joint ventures, it could have additional equity method investments. At September 30, 2020, Enable estimated the fair value of its investment in SESH was below the carrying value and concluded the decline in value was other than temporary due to the expiration of a transportation contract and then current status of renewal negotiations. As a result, Enable recorded a $225 million impairment on its investment in SESH for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nEnable could experience future events or circumstances that result in an impairment of long-lived assets, including intangible assets, equity method investments, or goodwill. If Enable recognizes an impairment, it would take an immediate non-cash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization. As a result, an impairment could have an adverse effect on Enable's results of operations and its ability to satisfy the financial ratios or other covenants under its existing or future debt agreements.\nEnable's business involves many hazards and operational risks, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. Insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nEnable's operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the gathering, processing, transportation and storage of natural gas and crude oil, including:\n\u2022damage to pipelines and plants, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, earthquakes and other natural disasters, acts of terrorism and actions by third parties;\n\u2022inadvertent damage from construction, vehicles and farm and utility equipment;\n\u2022leaks of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities;\n\u2022ruptures, fires and explosions; and\n\u2022other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life, pollution and suspension of operations.\nThese risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage. These risks may also result in curtailment or suspension of its operations. A natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which it operates could adversely affect Enable's results of operations. Enable is not fully insured against all risks inherent in its business. Enable currently has general\nliability and property insurance in place to cover certain of its facilities in amounts that it considers appropriate. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. Enable has business interruption insurance coverage for some but not all of its operations. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of Enable's facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without adversely affecting its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nThe use of derivative contracts by Enable and its subsidiaries in the normal course of business could result in financial losses that could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nEnable and its subsidiaries periodically use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage its commodity and financial market risks. Enable and its subsidiaries could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts, or should a counterparty fail to perform. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact Enable's results of operations.\nEnable's business is dependent on its ability to recruit, retain and motivate employees. Certain circumstances, such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements, a mismatch of existing skill sets to future needs, competition for skilled labor or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources, loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development. Enable's costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may rise. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect Enable's ability to manage and operate its business. If Enable is unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, its results of operations could be negatively affected.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Enable has 76 employees who are participants under OGE Energy defined benefit and retiree medical plans, who are seconded to the Partnership, subject to certain termination rights of the Partnership and OGE Energy. If seconding is terminated, employees of OGE Energy. that Enable determines to hire are under no obligation to accept Enable's offer of employment on the terms Enable provides, or at all.\nCybersecurity attacks or other disruptions of Enable's systems, networks and technology could adversely impact Enable's financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nEnable has become increasingly dependent on the systems, networks and technology that it uses to conduct almost all aspects of its business, including the operation of its gathering, processing, transportation and storage assets, the recording of commercial transactions and the reporting of financial information. Enable depends on both its own systems, networks and technology as well as the systems, networks and technology of its vendors, customers and other business partners. Any disruption of these systems, networks and technology could disrupt the operation of Enable's business. Disruptions can result from a variety of causes, including natural disasters, the failure of software or equipment and manmade events, such as cybersecurity attacks or information security breaches. Cybersecurity attacks and information security breaches could result in the unauthorized use of confidential, proprietary or other information and in the disruption of Enable's critical business functions and operations, adversely affecting its reputation and subjecting it to possible legal claims and liability. In addition, Enable is not fully insured against all cybersecurity risks.\nAs cybersecurity attacks continue to evolve, Enable may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cybersecurity attacks. In particular, Enable's implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for its personnel, information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. To date Enable has not experienced any material losses relating to cybersecurity attacks; however, there can be no assurance that it will not suffer such losses in the future. Consequently, it is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could adversely affect Enable's financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nTerrorist attacks or other physical security threats could adversely affect Enable's business.\nEnable's gathering, processing, transportation and storage assets may be targets of terrorist activities or other physical security threats that could disrupt its ability to conduct its business. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could adversely affect Enable's financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy. In addition, any physical damage to Enable's assets resulting from acts of terrorism may not be fully covered by Enable's insurance.\nIf Enable fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls, then it may not be able to accurately report financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential unitholders could lose confidence in its financial reporting, which would harm Enable's business and the trading price of its common units.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for Enable to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If its efforts to maintain an effective system of internal controls are not successful, it is unable to maintain adequate controls over its financial processes and reporting in the future or it is unable to comply with its obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, its operating results could be harmed or fail to meet its reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in its reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of Enable's common units.\nEnable depends on a small number of customers for a significant portion of its gathering and processing revenues and its transportation and storage revenues. The loss of, or reduction in volumes from, these customers could result in a decline in sales of its gathering and processing or transportation and storage services and adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, 61 percent of Enable's natural gas gathered volumes were attributable to the affiliates of Continental Resources, Inc., Vine Oil and Gas, GeoSouthern Energy Corporation, XTO Energy Inc. and Marathon Oil Corporation and 46 percent of its transportation and storage service revenues were attributable to affiliates of CenterPoint, Spire Inc., Continental Resources, Inc., American Electric Power Co. and OGE Energy. The loss of any portion of the gathering, processing, transportation and storage systems serving any of these customers, the failure to extend existing contracts at their expiration or the extension or replacement of these contracts on less favorable terms could adversely affect Enable's financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nEnable's exposure to credit risks of its customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by its customers could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nSome of Enable's customers may experience financial problems that could have a significant effect on its customers' creditworthiness. Severe financial problems encountered by its customers could limit Enable's ability to collect amounts owed to it, or to enforce performance of obligations under contractual arrangements. In addition, many of Enable's customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. The combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices, a reduction in borrowing bases under reserve-based credit facilities and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction of its customers' liquidity and limit its customers' ability to make payments or perform on obligations to Enable. For example, some of Enable's customers have experienced significantly reduced liquidity as a result of the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, some of Enable's customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to Enable. Financial problems experienced by its customers could result in the impairment of its assets, reduction of its operating cash flows and may also reduce or curtail its customers' future use of its products and services, which could reduce revenues.\nEnable and its operating subsidiaries' debt levels may limit their flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Enable had approximately $4.0 billion of long-term debt outstanding, excluding the premiums, discounts and unamortized debt expense on senior notes. In addition, as of December 31, 2020, Enable had $250 million outstanding under its commercial paper program. Enable also has a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility for working capital, capital expenditures and other partnership purposes, including acquisitions, with no borrowings outstanding, of which approximately $1.50 billion in borrowing capacity was undrawn as of December 31, 2020. As of January 29, 2021, Enable had $204 million outstanding under its commercial paper program and $1.54 billion of undrawn borrowing capacity under its\nrevolving credit facility. Enable has the ability to incur additional debt, subject to limitations in its credit facilities. The levels of debt could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022the ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022a portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities and distributions;\n\u2022the debt level will make Enable more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in the business or the economy generally; and\n\u2022the debt level may limit flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.\nEnable's and its operating subsidiaries' ability to service their debt will depend upon, among other things, their future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, commodity prices and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond their control. If operating results are not sufficient to service Enable's and its operating subsidiaries' current or future indebtedness, Enable and its subsidiaries may be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing debt, or seeking additional equity capital. These actions may not be effected on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nEnable's credit facilities contain operating and financial restrictions, including covenants and restrictions that may be affected by events beyond its control, which could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nEnable's credit facilities contain customary covenants that, among other things, limit the ability to:\n\u2022permit its subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022incur or permit to exist certain liens on assets;\n\u2022dispose of assets;\n\u2022merge or consolidate with another company or engage in a change of control;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates on non-arm's length terms; and\n\u2022change the nature of its business.\nEnable's credit facilities also require it to maintain certain financial ratios. Its ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond its control, Enable cannot assure it will meet those ratios. In addition, its credit facilities contain events of default customary for agreements of this nature.\nEnable's ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its credit facilities may be affected by events beyond its control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, its ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If any of the restrictions, covenants, ratios or tests in its credit facilities are violated, a significant portion of its indebtedness may become immediately due and payable. In addition, its lenders' commitments to make further loans to Enable under the revolving credit facility may be suspended or terminated. Enable might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.\nAny reductions in Enable's credit ratings could increase its financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships.\nEnable cannot provide assurance that its credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. If any of Enable's credit ratings are below investment grade, it may have higher future borrowing costs and it or its subsidiaries may be required to post cash collateral or letters of credit under certain contractual agreements. If cash collateral requirements were to occur at a time when Enable was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity, its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy, could be adversely affected.\nEnable may not be able to recover the costs of its substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions, and the actual cost of such improvements and additions may be significantly higher than it anticipates.\nEnable's business plan calls for investment in capital improvements and additions. The construction of additions or modifications to Enable's existing systems, and the construction of new midstream assets, involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital, which may exceed estimates. These projects may not be completed at the planned cost, on schedule or at all. The construction of new pipeline, gathering, treating, processing, compression or other facilities is subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs, costs and availability of equipment and materials such as steel, labor shortages or weather or other delays, inflation or other factors, which could be material. In addition, the construction of these facilities is typically subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies. Those agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner, if at all, or may impose restrictions or conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent a project from proceeding, lengthen its expected completion schedule and/or increase its anticipated cost. Moreover, revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if Enable expands an existing pipeline or a constructs a new pipeline, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and Enable may not receive any material increases in revenues or cash flows until the project is completed. In addition, Enable may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, the new facilities may not be able to achieve an expected investment return, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nIn connection with its capital investments, Enable may estimate, or engage a third party to estimate, potential reserves in areas to be developed prior to constructing facilities in those areas. To the extent Enable relies on estimates of future production in deciding to construct additions to its systems, those estimates may prove to be inaccurate either in volume or timing due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating future production. In addition, the construction of additions to existing gathering and transportation assets may require new rights-of-way prior to construction. Those rights-of-way to connect new natural gas supplies to existing gathering lines may be unavailable, and it may not be able to capitalize on attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive to obtain new rights-of-way or to renew existing rights-of-way. If the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights-of-way increases, its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy, could be adversely affected.\nEnable's ability to grow is dependent in part on its ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms.\nEnable expects its operating subsidiaries will distribute all of their available cash to Enable and that it will distribute all of its available cash to its unitholders. As a result, Enable and its operating subsidiaries rely significantly upon external financing sources, including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. To the extent Enable or its operating subsidiaries are unable to finance growth externally or through internally generated cash flows, Enable's and its operating subsidiaries' cash distribution policy may significantly impair Enable's and its operating subsidiaries' ability to grow. In addition, because Enable and its operating subsidiaries distribute all available cash, Enable's and its operating subsidiaries' growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations.\nTo the extent Enable issues additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that it will be unable to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level, which in turn may impact the available cash that Enable has to distribute on each unit. There are no limitations in the partnership agreement on its ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt by Enable or its operating subsidiaries to finance its growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which in turn may negatively impact the available cash that its operating subsidiaries have to distribute to it, and thus that it has to distribute to its unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nEnable depends in part on access to the capital markets and other external financing sources to fund its expansion capital expenditures, although Enable has also increasingly relied on cash flow generated from its operations to fund its expansion capital expenditures. Historically, unit prices of midstream master limited partnerships have experienced periods of volatility. In addition, because Enable's common units are yield-based securities, rising market interest rates could impact the relative attractiveness of its common units to investors. As a result of capital market volatility, Enable may be unable to issue equity or debt on satisfactory terms, or at all, which may limit its ability to expand its operations or make future acquisitions.\nEnable's merger and acquisition activities may not be successful or may result in completed acquisitions that do not perform as anticipated, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations or future growth.\nFrom time to time, Enable has made, and it intends to continue to make, acquisitions of businesses and assets. Such acquisitions involve substantial risks, including the following:\n\u2022acquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;\n\u2022acquired businesses or assets could have environmental, permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate;\n\u2022it may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to it, that exceed its estimates, or for which its rights to indemnification from the seller are limited;\n\u2022it may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems; and\n\u2022acquisitions, or the pursuit of acquisitions, could disrupt its ongoing businesses, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain its current business standards, controls and procedures.\nIn addition, Enable's growth strategy includes, in part, the ability to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms. If Enable is unable to make acquisitions or if its acquisitions do not perform as anticipated, Enable's future growth may be adversely affected.\nEnable may be unable to obtain or renew permits necessary for its operations, which could inhibit its ability to do business.\nPerformance of its operations require it obtain and maintain a number of federal and state permits, licenses and approvals with terms and conditions containing a significant number of prescriptive limits and performance standards in order to operate. All of these permits, licenses, approval limits and standards require a significant amount of monitoring, record keeping and reporting in order to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit, license, approval limit or standard. Noncompliance or incomplete documentation of Enable's compliance status may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive relief. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay the issuance of a new or existing material permit or other approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or other approval, could adversely affect its ability to initiate or continue operations at the affected location or facility and on its financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy. For example, in April 2020, the federal district court for the District of Montana issued an order vacating the Corps Clean Water Act Section 4040 Nationwide Permit 12, which authorizes pipeline crossings of streams and wetlands. Subsequent proceedings limited this order to the Keystone XL pipeline, which is not related to Enable's operations. Pending appeal of the court's decision, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has published a proposal to reissue its existing Nationwide Permits and associated general conditions and definitions, with certain modifications, including to the Corps Clean Water Act Section 4040 Nationwide Permit 12. While the full extent and impact of the court's action, as well as the proposed Corps Clean Water Act Section 4040 Nationwide Permit 12 re-issuance, is unclear at this time, a disruption in Enable's ability to obtain coverage under the Corps Clean Water Act Section 4040 Nationwide Permit 12 or other general permits may result in increased costs and project delays if Enable is required to seek individual permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\nAdditionally, in order to obtain permits and renewals of permits and other approvals in the future, Enable may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential adverse impact that any proposed pipeline or processing-related activities may have on the environment, individually or in the aggregate, including on public and American Indian tribal lands. Certain approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys, wetland delineations, endangered species surveys and other studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites. Compliance with these regulatory requirements may be expensive and may significantly lengthen the time required to prepare applications and to receive authorizations and consequently could disrupt Enable's project construction schedules.\nEnable's operations may be impacted by certain indigenous rights protections.\nParts of Enable's operations cross land that has historically been apportioned to various Native American tribes, who may exercise significant jurisdiction and sovereignty over their lands. Enable's operations may be impacted to the extent these tribal governments are found to have and choose to act upon such jurisdiction over lands where it operates. For example, a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2020 found that the Muscogee (Creek) Nation reservation in Eastern Oklahoma has not been disestablished, and subsequent court rulings applying this precedent have found similarly for other reservations. This ruling could lead to some confusion as to which agencies have authority to regulate activities in this area of Oklahoma.\nCosts of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations are significant, and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect Enable's financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nEnable is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, wildlife conservation, natural resources and health and safety that could, among other things, delay or increase costs of construction, restrict or limit the output of certain facilities and/or require additional pollution control equipment and otherwise increase costs. For instance, in May 2016, the EPA issued final standards governing methane emissions imposing more stringent controls on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions at new and modified oil and natural gas production, processing, storage and transmission facilities. These rules have required changes to Enable's operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions. In September 2020, the EPA finalized amendments to the 2016 standards that removed Enable's transmission and storage segments from the oil and natural gas source category and rescinded the methane-specific requirements for production and processing facilities. However, several lawsuits have been filed challenging these amendments, and on January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order calling for the suspension, revision or recission of the September 2020 rule and the reinstatement or issuance of standards for new, modified and existing oil and gas operations, including Enable's transmission and storage segments. As a result, Enable cannot predict the scope of any final methane regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements. However, several states are pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of methane from new and existing sources. There are significant capital, operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes, rules and regulations. Future federal and state regulations relating to Enable's gathering and processing, transmission and storage operations remain a possibility and could result in increased compliance costs on Enable's operations. Furthermore, if new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions are adopted in areas where Enable's crude oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, they could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells, some or all of which could adversely affect demand for Enable's services to those customers.\nThere is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in Enable's operations due to the handling of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and produced water as well as air emissions related to its operations and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. These matters are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection, including the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of plants, wildlife, and natural and cultural resources. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact business activities in many ways, such as restricting the handling or disposing of wastes or requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions that may be caused by its operations or that are attributable to former operators. Joint and several strict liability may be incurred, without regard to fault, under certain of these environmental laws and regulations in connection with discharges or releases of wastes on, under or from its properties and facilities, many of which have been used for midstream activities for a number of years, oftentimes by third parties not under its control. Private parties, including the owners of the properties through which its gathering and transportation systems pass and facilities where its wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance, as well as to seek damages for non- compliance, with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. For example, an accidental release from one of its pipelines could subject them to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. Enable may be unable to recover these costs from insurance. Moreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. Further, stricter requirements could negatively impact its customers' production and operations, resulting in less demand for its services.\nIncreased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and wastewater injection wells could result in reductions or delays in natural gas and crude oil production by Enable's customers, which could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nHydraulic fracturing is a common practice that is used by many of Enable's customers to stimulate production of natural gas and crude oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. In addition, certain federal agencies have proposed additional laws and regulations to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. The EPA has also issued regulations and guidance for hydraulic fracturing operations under several statutes.\nSome states have adopted, and other states have considered adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular, in some cases banning hydraulic fracturing entirely. If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where Enable's oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, they could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells, some or all of which activities could adversely affect demand for Enable's services to those customers.\nState and federal regulatory agencies have also focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity. Similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. Some state regulatory agencies have adopted their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity. For example, the OCC has implemented volume reduction plans, and at times required shut-ins, for disposal wells injecting wastewater from oil and gas operations into the Arbuckle formation. Certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal, state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. Enable cannot predict whether additional federal, state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs for Enable's customers, which in turn could reduce the demand for Enable's services.\nOther governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing or other regulatory mechanisms.\nEnable and its customers' operations are subject to a series of risks arising out of the threat of climate change that could result in increased operating costs, adversely impact Enable's results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy, limit the areas in which oil and natural gas production may occur and reduce demand for the products and services Enable provides.\nThe threat of possible global climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of greenhouse gases as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. As a result, Enable's operations as well as the operations of its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production customers are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of greenhouse gases.\nIn the U.S., no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. However, following the U.S. Supreme Court finding that greenhouse gas emissions constitute a pollutant under the Clean Air Act, the EPA has adopted regulations that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for greenhouse gas emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the U.S., and together with the Department of Transportation, implement greenhouse gas emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the U.S. The regulation of methane from oil and gas facilities has been subject to uncertainty in recent years. For more information, see the risk factor, \"Costs of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations are significant, and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect Enable's financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy,\" above. Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as greenhouse gas cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs and restriction of emissions. Internationally, the United Nations sponsored Paris Agreement requires member states to individually determine and submit non-binding emissions reduction targets every five years after 2020. The U.S. had officially withdrawn from the \"Paris Agreement\" on November 4, 2020. However, newly elected President Biden announced on January 20, 2021 that the U.S. would rejoin the agreement and called on the federal government to begin formulating the U.S.'s nationally determined emissions reduction targets under the agreement.\nGovernmental, scientific and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from greenhouse gas emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the U.S., including climate change related pledges, made by certain candidates recently elected to public office. These have included promises to limit emissions and curtail the production of oil and gas, such\nas through the cessation of leasing public land for hydrocarbon development. For example, on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that commits to substantial action on climate change, calling for, among other things, the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry and increased emphasis on climate-related risk across governmental agencies and economic sectors. Separately, on January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior issued an order that, among other things, imposed a temporary suspension on the issuance of fossil fuel authorizations, including leases and permits, on federal lands. Although the order says it does not limit existing operations under valid leases, on January 27, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order suspending new oil and gas leasing on federal lands, pending completion of a review of the federal government's oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. Other actions that could be pursued by the Biden Administration may include the imposition of more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of liquefied natural gas export facilities. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities and other local governments have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to climate change. Suits have also been brought against such companies under shareholder and consumer production laws, alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change but failed to adequately disclose those impacts.\nThere are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as shareholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into other related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. There is also a risk that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the fossil fuel sector. Recently, the Federal Reserve announced that it has applied to join the Network for Greening the Financial System, a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. A material reduction in the capital available to the fossil fuel industry could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration, development, production, transportation and processing activities, which could result in decreased demand for Enable's services.\nThe adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil and natural gas, which could reduce demand for Enable's services and products. Additionally, political, litigation and financial risks may result in Enable's oil and natural gas customers restricting or canceling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes or impairing their ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce demand for Enable's services and products. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on Enable's business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nFinally, many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could adversely affect Enable's results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy. In addition, while Enable's consideration of changing weather conditions and inclusion of safety factors in design covers the uncertainties that climate change and other events may potentially introduce, its ability to mitigate the adverse impacts of these events depends in part on the effectiveness of its facilities and disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning, which may not have considered or be prepared for every eventuality.\nEnable's operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal regulatory authorities. Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nThe rates charged by several of Enable's pipeline systems, including for interstate gas transportation service provided by its intrastate pipelines, are regulated by the FERC. The FERC and state regulatory agencies also regulate other terms and conditions of the services it may offer. If one of these regulatory agencies, on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties, were to lower its tariff rates or deny any rate increase or other material changes to the types or terms and conditions of service it might propose or offer, the profitability of its pipeline businesses could suffer. If it were permitted to raise its tariff rates for a particular pipeline, there might be significant delay between the time the tariff rate increase is approved and the time that the rate increase actually goes into effect, which could also limit profitability. Furthermore, competition from other transportation and storage systems may prevent them from raising its tariff rates even if permitted by regulatory agencies. The regulatory agencies that regulate its systems periodically implement new rules, regulations and terms and conditions of services\nsubject to its jurisdiction. New initiatives or orders may adversely affect the rates charged for services or otherwise adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nEnable's natural gas interstate pipelines are regulated by the FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Generally, the FERC's authority over interstate natural gas transportation extends to:\n\u2022rates, operating terms, conditions of service and service contracts;\n\u2022certification and construction of new facilities;\n\u2022extension or abandonment of services and facilities or expansion of existing facilities;\n\u2022maintenance of accounts and records;\n\u2022acquisition and disposition of facilities;\n\u2022initiation and discontinuation of services;\n\u2022depreciation and amortization policies;\n\u2022conduct and relationship with certain affiliates;\n\u2022market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or natural gas transportation; and\n\u2022various other matters.\nShould Enable fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, it could be subject to substantial penalties and fines. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC has civil penalty authority under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 to impose penalties for current violations of up to approximately $1.3 million per day for each violation as well as possible criminal penalties.\nThe FERC's jurisdiction extends to the certification and construction of interstate transportation and storage facilities, including, but not limited to expansions, lateral and other facilities and abandonment of facilities and services. Prior to commencing construction of significant new interstate transportation and storage facilities, an interstate pipeline must obtain a certificate authorizing the construction, or an order amending its existing certificate, from the FERC. Certain minor expansions are authorized by blanket certificates that the FERC has issued by rule. Typically, a significant expansion project requires review by a number of governmental agencies, including state and local agencies, whose cooperation is important in completing the regulatory process on schedule. Any failure by an agency to issue sufficient authorizations or permits in a timely manner for one or more of these projects may mean that Enable will not be able to pursue these projects or that they will be constructed in a manner or with capital requirements that Enable did not anticipate. Enable's inability to obtain sufficient permits and authorizations in a timely manner could materially and negatively impact the additional revenues expected from these projects.\nThe FERC conducts audits to verify compliance with the FERC's regulations and the terms of its orders, including whether the websites of interstate pipelines accurately provide information on the operations and availability of services. The FERC's regulations require uniform terms and conditions for service, as set forth in agreements for transportation and storage services executed between interstate pipelines and their customers. These service agreements are required to conform, in all material respects, with the standard form of service agreements set forth in the pipeline's FERC-approved tariff. Non-conforming agreements must be filed with, and accepted by, the FERC. In the event that the FERC finds that an agreement, in whole or part, is materially non-conforming, it could reject the agreement or require Enable to seek modification, or alternatively require Enable to modify its tariff so that the non-conforming provisions are generally available to all customers.\nThe rates, terms and conditions for transporting natural gas in interstate commerce on certain of Enable's intrastate pipelines and for services offered at certain of Enable's storage facilities are subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Rates to provide such interstate transportation service must be \"fair and equitable\" under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and are subject to review, refund with interest if found not to be fair and equitable, and approval by the FERC at least once every five years.\nEnable's crude oil gathering systems in the Williston Basin are subject to common carrier regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act. The Interstate Commerce Act requires that Enable maintain tariffs on file with the FERC setting forth the rates Enable charges for providing transportation services, as well as the rules and regulations governing such services. The Interstate Commerce Act also requires, among other things, that Enable's rates must be \"just and reasonable\" and that Enable provide service in a manner that is nondiscriminatory. Shippers on Enable's FERC-regulated crude oil gathering systems may protest its tariff filings, file complaints against its existing rates, or the FERC can investigate Enable's rates on its own initiative. If FERC finds that Enable's existing or proposed rates are unjust and unreasonable, it could deny requested rate increases or could order Enable to reduce its rates and could require the payment of reparations to complaining shippers for up to two years prior to the complaint.\nEnable's operations may also be subject to regulation by state and local regulatory authorities. Changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nThe pipeline operations of Enable that are not regulated by the FERC may be subject to state and local regulation applicable to intrastate natural gas and transportation services. State and local regulations generally focus on safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, prohibition of undue discrimination among shippers. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered and, in some instances, adopted from time to time. Enable cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on operations, but it could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes. Other state and local regulations also may affect the business. Any such state or local regulation could have an adverse effect on the business and the financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nA change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of Enable's assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of its assets, which may cause its revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase.\nEnable's natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation systems are generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the FERC under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, and its crude oil gathering system in the Anadarko Basin is generally exempt from the jurisdiction of FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act. Nevertheless, FERC regulation may indirectly impact these businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses. The FERC's policies and practices across the range of its oil and natural gas regulatory activities, including, for example, its policies on interstate open access transportation, ratemaking, capacity release, and market center promotion may indirectly affect intrastate markets. In recent years, the FERC has pursued pro-competitive policies in its regulation of interstate oil and natural gas pipelines. However, it cannot be assured that the FERC will continue to pursue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may indirectly affect the intrastate natural gas transportation business. Although the FERC has not made a formal determination with respect to all of Enable's facilities it considers to be engaged in natural gas gathering or a formal determination with respect to its facilities that it considers to be engaged in intrastate crude oil gathering, Enable believes that its natural gas gathering facilities meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a natural gas gathering pipeline and Enable's intrastate crude oil gathering facilities meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is not engaged in interstate crude oil transportation. The distinction between FERC-regulated facilities, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and the FERC determines whether facilities are subject to regulation under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 or the Interstate Commerce Act on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of its facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts or Congress. If the FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility and/or services provided by it are not exempt from FERC regulation, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the FERC. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect Enable's financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders, including OGE Energy. In addition, if any of Enable's facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the Natural Gas Act of 1938, Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 or Interstate Commerce Act regulations, this could result in the imposition of substantial civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge revenues collected for such services in excess of the maximum rates established by the FERC.\nNatural gas gathering and intrastate crude oil gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level; therefore, these operations could be adversely affected should it become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services. Enable's gathering operations could also be subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design, construction, testing, operation, replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities. Enable cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on its operations, but it could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.\nEnable may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from compliance with pipeline safety laws and regulations, pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs.\nCertain of Enable's pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations. The U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration regulates safety requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of its jurisdictional natural gas and hazardous liquids pipeline facilities. All of Enable's interstate and intrastate natural gas transportation pipeline facilities are Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration jurisdictional and certain of Enable's natural gas gathering, NGLs and crude oil pipeline facilities are Pipeline and Hazardous\nMaterials Safety Administration jurisdictional. Among other things, these laws and regulations require pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures, for pipelines located in \"high consequence areas.\" The regulations require operators, including Enable, to, among other things:\n\u2022perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;\n\u2022develop a baseline plan to prioritize the assessment of a covered pipeline segment;\n\u2022identify and characterize applicable threats that could impact a high consequence area;\n\u2022improve data collection, integration, and analysis;\n\u2022repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and\n\u2022implement preventive and mitigating action.\nFailure to comply with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration or comparable state pipeline safety regulations could result in a number of consequences which may have an adverse effect on Enable's operations. Enable incurs significant costs associated with its compliance with existing Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and comparable state pipeline regulations. Enable incurred maintenance capital expenditures and operation and maintenance expenses of $66 million in 2020 and currently estimates that it will incur maintenance capital expenditures and operation and maintenance expenses of up to $68 million in 2021 under its pipeline safety program, including costs related to integrity assessments and repairs, threat and risk analyses, implementing preventative and mitigative measures, and conducting activities to support the maximum allowable operating pressure for gas pipelines or the maximum operating pressure for hazardous liquid pipelines. Enable may incur significant cost associated with repair, remediation, preventive and mitigation measures associated with its integrity management programs for pipelines that are not currently subject to regulation by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.\nChanges to existing pipeline safety regulations may result in increased operating and compliance costs. For example, in October 2019, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration published three final rules on pipeline safety that create or expand reporting, inspection, maintenance and other pipeline safety obligations. While Enable has estimated the impact of these rules on its future costs of operations, actual costs to comply may be significantly higher.\nThe Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration is working on two additional rules related to gas pipeline safety, though Enable cannot predict when they will be finalized. The rule entitled \"Pipeline Safety: Safety of Gas Transmission Pipelines, Repair Criteria, Integrity Management Improvements, Cathodic Protection, Management of Change, and Other Related Amendments\" is expected to adjust the repair criteria for pipelines in high consequence areas, create new criteria for pipelines in non-high consequence areas, and strengthen integrity management assessment requirements. The rule entitled \"Safety of Gas Gathering Pipelines\" is expected to require all gas gathering pipeline operators to report incidents and annual pipeline data and to extend regulatory safety requirements to certain gas gathering pipelines in rural areas. The adoption of these or other regulations requiring more comprehensive or stringent safety standards could require Enable to install new or modified safety controls, pursue new capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, all of which could require Enable to incur increased and potentially significant operational costs.\nFinancial reform regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act could adversely affect Enable's ability to use derivative instruments to hedge risks associated with its business.\nAt times, Enable may hedge all or a portion of its commodity risk and its interest rate risk. The federal government regulates the derivatives markets and entities, including businesses like Enable, that participate in those markets through the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the legislation. Under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's regulations, Enable is subject to reporting and recordkeeping obligations for transactions involving non-financial swap transactions. The Commodity Futures Trading Commissions initially adopted regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents, but these rules were successfully challenged in federal district court by the Securities Industry Financial Markets Association and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association and largely vacated by the court. In December 2013, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission published a notice of proposed rulemaking designed to implement new position limits regulation and in December 2016, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's re-proposal position limits regulations. The ultimate form and timing of the implementation of the regulatory regime affecting commodity derivatives remains uncertain.\nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission has imposed mandatory clearing requirements on certain categories of swaps, including certain interest rate swaps, but has exempted derivatives intended to hedge or mitigate commercial risk from the mandatory swap clearing requirement, where a counterparty such as Enable has a required identification number, is not a\nfinancial entity as defined by the regulations, and meets a minimum asset test. Enable's management believes its hedging transactions qualify for this \"commercial end-user\" exception. The Dodd-Frank Act may also require Enable to comply with margin requirements in connection with its hedging activities, although the application of those provisions to Enable is uncertain at this time. The Dodd-Frank Act may also require the counterparties to its derivative instruments to spin off some of their hedging activities to a separate entity, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivatives contracts for Enable's industry (including requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect Enable's available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivatives contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks Enable encounters, reduce its ability to monetize or restructure its existing derivatives contracts, and increase its exposure to less creditworthy counterparties, particularly if Enable is unable to utilize the commercial end user exception with respect to certain of its hedging transactions. If Enable reduces its use of hedging as a result of the legislation and regulations, its results of operations may become more volatile and its cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect its ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures and fund unitholder distributions. Finally, the legislation was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to crude oil and natural gas. Enable's revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nEnable derives a substantial portion of its gross margin from subsidiaries through which it holds a substantial portion of its assets.\nEnable derives a substantial portion of its gross margin from, and holds a substantial portion of its assets through, its subsidiaries. As a result, it depends on distributions from its subsidiaries in order to meet its payment obligations. In general, these subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide Enable with funds for its payment obligations, whether by dividends, distributions, loans or otherwise. In addition, provisions of applicable law, such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends, limit its subsidiaries' ability to make payments or other distributions, and its subsidiaries could agree to contractual restrictions on its ability to make distributions.\nThe right by Enable to receive any assets of any subsidiary, and therefore the right of its creditors to participate in those assets, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary's creditors, including trade creditors. In addition, even if Enable were a creditor of any subsidiary, its rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by them.\nEnable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures, which subjects them to additional risks that could adversely affect the success of these operations and Enable's financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nEnable conducts a portion of its operations through joint ventures with third parties, including Enbridge Inc., DCP Midstream Partners, LP, CVR Energy, Inc., Trans Louisiana Gas Pipeline, Inc. and Pablo Gathering, LLC. It may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future. These third parties may have obligations that are important to the success of the joint venture, such as the obligation to pay their share of capital and other costs of the joint venture. The performance of these third-party obligations, including the ability of the third parties to satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, is outside the control of Enable. If these parties do not satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, Enable's business may be adversely affected.\nThe joint venture arrangements of Enable may involve risks not otherwise present when operating assets directly, including, for example:\n\u2022joint venture partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions;\n\u2022joint venture partners may not pay their share of the obligations, leaving Enable liable for their shares of joint venture liabilities;\n\u2022possible inability to control the amount of cash it will receive from the joint venture;\n\u2022it may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by its joint venture partners;\n\u2022it may be required to devote significant management time to the requirements of and matters relating to the joint ventures;\n\u2022its insurance policies may not fully cover loss or damage incurred by both them and its joint venture partners in certain circumstances;\n\u2022its joint venture partners may be in a position to take actions contrary to its instructions or requests or contrary to its policies or objectives; and\n\u2022disputes between them and its joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses.\nThe risks described above or the failure to continue joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with joint venture partners could adversely affect Enable's ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture, which would in turn adversely affect Enable's financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to unitholders, including OGE Energy. The agreements under which certain joint ventures were formed may subject them to various risks, limit the actions it may take with respect to the assets subject to the joint venture and require Enable to grant rights to its joint venture partners that could limit its ability to benefit fully from future positive developments. Some joint ventures require Enable to make significant capital expenditures. If it does not timely meet its financial commitments or otherwise do not comply with its joint venture agreements, its rights to participate, exercise operator rights or otherwise influence or benefit from the joint venture may be adversely affected. Certain of its joint venture partners may have substantially greater financial resources than Enable has and it may not be able to secure the funding necessary to participate in operations its joint venture partners propose, thereby reducing its ability to benefit from the joint venture.\nUnder certain circumstances, Enbridge Inc. could have the right to purchase an ownership interest in SESH at fair market value.\nEnable owns a 50 percent ownership interest in SESH. The remaining 50 percent ownership interests are held by Enbridge Inc. As of December 31, 2020, CenterPoint owns 53.7 percent of Enable's common units, 100.0 percent of its Series A Preferred Units and a 40 percent economic interest in Enable GP, LLC. Pursuant to the terms of the limited liability company agreement of SESH, as amended, if, at any time, CenterPoint has a right to receive less than 50 percent of Enable's distributions through its interests in Enable and in the general partner, or does not have the ability to exercise certain control rights, Enbridge Inc. could have the right to purchase Enable's interest in SESH at fair market value, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe amount of cash Enable has available for distribution to its limited partners depends primarily on its cash flow rather than on its profitability, which may prevent Enable from making distributions, even during periods in which it records net income.\nThe amount of cash Enable has available for distribution depends primarily upon its cash flow rather than on profitability. Profitability is affected by non-cash items but cash flow is not. As a result, Enable may make cash distributions during periods when it records losses for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when it records net earnings for financial accounting purposes.\nAffiliates of Enable's general partner, including CenterPoint and OGE Energy, may compete with Enable, and neither the general partner nor its affiliates have any obligation to present business opportunities to Enable.\nUnder Enable's omnibus agreement, both CenterPoint and OGE Energy are prohibited from, directly or indirectly, owning, operating, acquiring or investing in any business engaged in midstream operations located within the U.S., other than through Enable. This requirement applies to both CenterPoint and OGE Energy for so long as either CenterPoint or OGE Energy holds any interest in Enable's general partner or at least 20 percent of its common units. However, if CenterPoint or OGE Energy acquires any business with midstream operations assets that have a value in excess of $50.0 million (or $100.0 million in the aggregate with such party's other acquired midstream operations assets that have not been offered to Enable), the acquiring party will be required to offer to Enable such assets for such value. If Enable does not purchase such assets, the acquiring party will be free to retain and operate such midstream assets, so long as the value of the assets does not reach certain thresholds.\nAs a result, under the circumstances described above, CenterPoint and OGE Energy have the ability to construct or acquire assets that directly compete with Enable's assets. Pursuant to the terms of Enable's partnership agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, does not apply to Enable's general partner or any of its affiliates, including its executive officers and directors and CenterPoint and OGE Energy. Any such person or entity that becomes aware of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for Enable will not have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to Enable. Any such person or entity will not be liable to Enable or to any limited partner for breach of any fiduciary duty or other duty by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another person or entity or does not communicate such opportunity or information to Enable. This may create actual and potential conflicts of interest between Enable and affiliates of its general partner and result in less than favorable treatment of Enable and its common unitholders.\nEnable may issue additional units without unitholder approval, which would dilute existing unitholder ownership interests.\nEnable's partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests, including limited partner interests that rank senior to the common units, that it may issue at any time without the approval of its unitholders. The issuance by Enable of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:\n\u2022Enable's existing unitholders' proportionate ownership interest in Enable will decrease;\n\u2022the amount of distributable cash flow on each unit may decrease;\n\u2022because the amount payable to holders of incentive distribution rights is based on a percentage of the total distributable cash flow, the distributions to holders of incentive distribution rights will increase even if the per unit distribution on common units remains the same;\n\u2022the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase;\n\u2022the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and\n\u2022the market price of the common units may decline.\nIn addition, upon a change of control or certain fundamental transactions, Enable's Series A Preferred Units are convertible into common units at the option of the holders of such units. If a substantial portion of the Series A Preferred Units were converted into common units, common unitholders could experience significant dilution. In addition, if holders of such converted Series A Preferred Units were to dispose of a substantial portion of these common units in the public market, whether in a single transaction or series of transactions, it could adversely affect the market price for Enable's common units. In addition, these sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, could make it more difficult for Enable to sell its common units in the future.\nAffiliates of Enable's general partner may sell common units in the public or private markets, which could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the common units and may sell their interest in its general partner, which may impact its strategic direction.\nAs of January 29, 2021, CenterPoint held 233,856,623 of Enable's common units and 14,520,000 Series A Preferred Units, and OGE Energy held 110,982,805 of Enable's common units. Enable's Series A Preferred Units are convertible into common units upon a change of control or certain fundamental transactions at the option of the holders of such units. Both Enable's common units held by CenterPoint and OGE Energy, as well as Enable's Series A Preferred Units held by CenterPoint, are subject to certain registration rights. The sale of these units in the public or private markets could have an adverse impact on the price of the common units or on any trading market that may develop. In addition, any sale of Enable's general partner by CenterPoint or OGE Energy may impact Enable's strategic direction, business or results of operations.\nEnable's Series A Preferred Units have rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to the rights of, holders of its common units.\nEnable's Series A Preferred Units rank senior to all of its other classes or series of equity securities with respect to distribution rights and rights upon liquidation. Enable cannot declare or pay a distribution to its common unitholders for any quarter unless full distributions have been or contemporaneously are being paid on all outstanding Series A Preferred Units for such quarter. These preferences could adversely affect the market price for Enable's common units or could make it more difficult for Enable to sell its common units in the future.\nHolders of the Series A Preferred Units will receive, on a non-cumulative basis and if and when declared by Enable's general partner, a quarterly cash distribution, subject to certain adjustments, equal to an annual rate of 10 percent on the stated liquidation preference from the date of original issue to, but not including, the five year anniversary of the original issue date, and an annual rate of the London interbank offered rate, or LIBOR, plus a spread of 850 basis points on the stated liquidation preference thereafter. In connection with certain transfers of the Series A Preferred Units, the Series A Preferred Units will automatically convert into one or more new series of preferred units (the \"other preferred units\") on the later of the date of transfer or the second anniversary of the date of issue. The other preferred units will have the same terms as Enable's Series A Preferred Units except that unpaid distributions on the other preferred units will accrue from the date of their issuance on a cumulative basis until paid. Enable's Series A Preferred Units are convertible into common units by the holders of such units in certain circumstances. Payment of distributions on Enable's Series A Preferred Units, or on the common units issued following the conversion of such Series A Preferred Units, could impact its liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, and other general partnership purposes. Enable's obligations to the holders of Series A Preferred Units could also limit its ability to obtain additional financing or increase its borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on its financial condition.\nEnable's Series A Preferred Units contain covenants that may limit its business flexibility.\nEnable's Series A Preferred Units contain covenants preventing it from taking certain actions without the approval of the holders of 66 2/3 percent of the Series A Preferred Units. The need to obtain the approval of holders of the Series A Preferred Units before taking these actions could impede Enable's ability to take certain actions that its management or its board of directors may consider to be in the best interests of its unitholders. The affirmative vote of 66 2/3 percent of the outstanding Series A Preferred Units, voting as a single class, is necessary to amend Enable's Partnership Agreement in any manner that would or could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the rights, preferences, obligations or privileges of the Series A Preferred Units. The affirmative vote of 66 2/3 percent of the outstanding Series A Preferred Units and any outstanding series of other preferred units, voting as a single class, is necessary to (A) create or issue certain party securities with proceeds in an aggregate amount in excess of $700.0 million or create or issue any senior securities or (B) subject to Enable's right to redeem the Series A Preferred Units, approve certain fundamental transactions.\nEnable's Series A Preferred Units are required to be redeemed in certain circumstances if they are not eligible for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and Enable may not have sufficient funds to redeem its Series A Preferred Units if it is required to do so.\nThe holders of Enable's Series A Preferred Units may request that Enable list those units for trading on the New York Stock Exchange. If Enable is unable to list the Series A Preferred Units in certain circumstances, it will be required to redeem the Series A Preferred Units. There can be no assurance that Enable would have sufficient financial resources available to satisfy its obligation to redeem the Series A Preferred Units. In addition, mandatory redemption of Enable's Series A Preferred Units could adversely affect its financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nEnable's Pending Merger with Energy Transfer\nBecause the exchange ratio is fixed and because the market price of Energy Transfer\u2019s common units may fluctuate, Enable's unitholders, including OGE Energy, cannot be certain of the precise value of any merger consideration they may receive in the Energy Transfer merger.\nAt the time the Energy Transfer merger is completed, each issued and outstanding common unit of Enable will be converted into the right to receive the merger consideration of 0.8595 of one common unit representing limited partner interests in Energy Transfer. The exchange ratio for the merger consideration is fixed, and there will be no adjustment to the merger consideration for changes in the market price of Energy Transfer common units or Enable's common units prior to the completion of the merger. If the merger is completed, there will be a time lapse between the date of signing the merger agreement and the date on which Enable's unitholders, including OGE Energy, who are entitled to receive the merger consideration actually receive the merger consideration. The market value of Energy Transfer's common units may fluctuate during this period as a result of a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in Energy Transfer's businesses, operations and prospects and regulatory considerations. Such factors are difficult to predict and in many cases may be beyond Enable's and Energy Transfer's control. The actual value of any merger consideration received by Enable's unitholders, including OGE Energy, upon the completion of the merger will depend on the market value of the common units of Energy Transfer at that time. This market value may differ, possibly materially, from the market value of Energy Transfer's common units at the time the merger agreement was entered into or at any other time. Enable's unitholders, including OGE Energy, should obtain current quotations for Energy Transfer's common units and for Enable's common units.\nThe merger may not be completed and the merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms.\nThe merger is subject to a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to the completion of the merger, including (i) the receipt of the required approvals from Enable's unitholders, including OGE Energy, (ii) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, (iii) the absence of any governmental order or law that prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of the merger, (iv) Energy Transfer common units issuable in connection with the merger having been authorized for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance and (v) Energy Transfer's registration statement on Form S-4 having been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933. The obligation of each party to consummate the merger is also conditioned upon the other party's representations and warranties being true and correct (subject to certain materiality exceptions) and the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the merger agreement. The obligation of Enable to consummate the merger is further conditioned upon the receipt of a customary tax opinion of counsel to Enable that for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to certain exceptions, (i) Enable should not recognize any income or gain as a result of the merger and (ii) no gain or loss should be recognized by holders of Enable's common units or Series A Preferred Units as a result\nof the merger. These conditions to the completion of the merger may not be satisfied or waived in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the merger may be delayed or may not be completed.\nMoreover, if the merger is not completed by November 30, 2021, either Energy Transfer or Enable may choose not to proceed with the Energy Transfer merger, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time, before or after approval by Enable's common unitholders, including OGE Energy. In addition, Energy Transfer and Enable may elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain other circumstances as further detailed in the merger agreement.\nThe merger agreement limits Enable's ability to pursue alternatives to the merger.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting a competing proposal that might result in greater value to Enable's unitholders, including OGE Energy, than the merger, or may result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per unit price to acquire Enable than it might otherwise have proposed to pay. These provisions include covenants not to solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate proposals relating to alternative transactions or, subject to certain exceptions, enter into discussions concerning or provide any non-public information in connection with alternative transactions.\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively impact the price of Enable's common units, as well as Enable's future businesses and financial results.\nThe merger agreement contains a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived prior to the completion of the merger. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions to the completion of the merger will be so satisfied or waived. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived, Enable will be unable to complete the merger.\nIf the merger is not completed for any reason, including the failure to receive the required approval of holders of Enable's common units, including OGE Energy, Enable's future businesses and financial results may be adversely affected, including as follows:\n\u2022Enable may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on the market price of Enable's common units;\n\u2022the manner in which customers, vendors, business partners and other third parties perceive Enable may be negatively impacted, which in turn could affect its marketing operations or its ability to compete for new business or obtain renewals in the marketplace more broadly;\n\u2022Enable will still be required to pay certain significant costs relating to the merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees;\n\u2022Enable may experience negative reactions from employees; and\n\u2022Enable will have expended time and resources that could otherwise have been spent on its existing businesses and the pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to Enable.\nIn addition to the above risks, if the merger agreement is terminated and Enable's board of directors seeks an alternative transaction, Enable's unitholders, including OGE Energy, cannot be certain that Enable will be able to find a party willing to engage in a transaction on more attractive terms than the merger. If the merger agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, Enable may be required to pay Energy Transfer a termination fee.\nEnable will be subject to business uncertainties while the merger is pending, which could adversely affect its businesses.\nUncertainties about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Enable. These uncertainties may impair Enable's ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter and could cause customers and others that deal with Enable to seek to change their existing business relationships with Enable. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger, as employees may experience uncertainty about their roles with Energy Transfer following the merger. In addition, the merger agreement restricts Enable from entering into certain corporate transactions and taking other specified actions without the consent of Energy Transfer, and generally requires Enable to continue its operations in the ordinary course, until completion of the merger. These restrictions may prevent Enable from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger.\nThe common units representing limited partner interests in Energy Transfer to be received by Enable's common unitholders, including OGE Energy, upon completion of the merger will have different rights than Enable's common units.\nUpon completion of the merger, Enable's unitholders, including OGE Energy, will no longer be unitholders of Enable. Instead, Enable's former unitholders, including OGE Energy, will become Energy Transfer unitholders and while their rights as Energy Transfer unitholders will continue to be governed by the laws of the state of Delaware, their rights will be subject to and governed by the terms of the Energy Transfer certificate of limited partnership, as amended, and the third amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of Energy Transfer, as amended. The laws of the state of Delaware and terms of the Energy Transfer certificate of limited partnership and the Energy Transfer third amended and restated agreement of limited partnership are in some respects different than the terms of Enable's certificate of limited partnership and Enable's partnership agreement, which currently govern the rights of Enable's unitholders, including OGE Energy.\nCompletion of the merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Enable is a party.\nThe completion of the merger may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Enable is a party. If Enable is unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements, or seeking monetary damages. Even if Enable is able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to Enable.\nEnable will incur significant transaction and merger-related costs in connection with the merger, which may be in excess of those anticipated by Enable.\nEnable has incurred and expects to continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with negotiating and completing the merger, combining the operations of the two partnerships and achieving desired synergies. These fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial. The substantial majority of non-recurring expenses will consist of transaction costs related to the merger and include, among others, employee retention costs, fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, severance and benefit costs and filing fees. Many of these costs will be borne by Enable even if the merger is not completed.\nEnable may be a target of securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the merger from being completed.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into merger agreements. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the merger, then that injunction may delay or prevent the merger from being completed, which may adversely affect Enable's business, financial position and results of operation. Currently, Enable is unaware of any securities class action lawsuits or derivative lawsuits having been filed in connection with the merger.\nGENERAL RISKS\nGovernmental and market reactions to events involving other public companies or other energy companies that are beyond our control may have negative impacts on our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and access to capital.\nAccounting irregularities at public companies in general, and energy companies in particular, and investigations by governmental authorities into energy trading activities and political contributions, could lead to public and regulatory scrutiny and suspicion for public companies, including those in the regulated and unregulated utility business. Accounting irregularities could cause regulators and legislators to review current accounting practices, financial disclosures and relationships between companies and their independent auditors. The capital markets and rating agencies also could increase their level of scrutiny. We believe that we are complying with all applicable laws and accounting standards, but it is difficult or impossible to predict or control what effect any of these types of events may have on our business, financial position, cash flows or access to the capital markets. It is unclear what additional laws or regulations may develop, and we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any future changes in accounting regulations or practices in general with respect to public companies, the energy industry or our operations specifically. Any new accounting standards could affect the way we are required to record revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and equity. These changes in accounting standards could lead to negative impacts on reported earnings or\ndecreases in assets or increases in liabilities that could, in turn, affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nEconomic conditions could negatively impact our business and our results of operations.\nOur operations are affected by local, national and worldwide economic conditions. The consequences of a recession could include a lower level of economic activity and uncertainty regarding energy prices and the capital and commodity markets. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could adversely affect our revenues and future growth. Instability in the financial markets, as a result of recession or otherwise, also could affect the cost of capital and our ability to raise capital. Economic conditions may also impact the valuation of certain long-lived assets, including our investment in unconsolidated affiliates, that are subject to impairment testing, potentially resulting in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In March 2020, OGE Energy recognized an impairment charge related to its investment in Enable, which resulted from decreased demand for commodities as a result of COVID-19. The impairment charge had a material adverse impact on OGE Energy's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nEconomic conditions may be impacted by insufficient financial sector liquidity leading to potential increased unemployment, which could impact the ability of our customers to pay timely, increase customer bankruptcies, and could lead to increased bad debt. If such circumstances occur, we expect that commercial and industrial customers would be impacted first, with residential customers following.\nIn addition, economic conditions, particularly budget shortfalls, could increase the pressure on federal, state and local governments to raise additional funds by increasing corporate tax rates and/or delaying, reducing or eliminating tax credits, grants or other incentives that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to financial risks associated with climate change.\nClimate change creates financial risk. Potential regulation associated with climate change legislation could pose financial risks to OGE Energy and its affiliates. On November 4, 2020, the U.S. officially withdrew from the United Nations' \"Paris Agreement\" on climate change. Newly elected President Biden announced on January 20, 2021 that the U.S would rejoin the agreement. The \"Paris Agreement\" or other legal requirements that result in enforceable greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements could lead to increased compliance costs for OGE Energy and its affiliates. In addition, to the extent that any climate change adversely affects the national or regional economic health through physical impacts or increased rates caused by the inclusion of additional regulatory costs, CO2 taxes or imposed costs, OGE Energy and its affiliates may be adversely impacted. There are also increasing risks for energy companies from shareholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change who may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into entities that emit lower levels of greenhouse gases or into non-energy related sectors. Institutional investors and lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable investing and lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. To the extent financial markets view climate change and emissions of greenhouse gases as a financial risk, this could negatively affect our ability to access capital markets or cause us to receive less than ideal terms and conditions.\nIn addition, we may be subject to financial risks from private party litigation relating to greenhouse gas emissions. Defense costs associated with such litigation can be significant and an adverse outcome could require substantial capital expenditures and could possibly require payment of substantial penalties or damages. Such payments or expenditures could affect results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks and increased reliance on processes automated by technology.\nIn the regular course of our business, we handle a range of sensitive security and customer information. We are subject to laws and rules issued by different agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information. A security breach of our information systems such as theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information, including confidential customer information or system operating information, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOG&E operates in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite implementation of security measures, the technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access. Such failures or breaches of the systems could impact the reliability of OG&E's generation, transmission and distribution systems which may result in a loss of service to customers and also subject OG&E to financial harm due to the significant expense to respond to security breaches or repair system damage. OG&E's Smart\nGrid program further increases potential risks associated with cybersecurity attacks. Our generation and transmission systems are part of an interconnected system. Therefore, a disruption caused by the impact of a cybersecurity incident of the regional electric transmission grid, natural gas pipeline infrastructure or other fuel sources of our third-party service providers' operations could also negatively impact our business. If the technology systems were to fail or be breached and not recovered in a timely manner, critical business functions could be impaired and sensitive confidential data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nSecurity threats continue to evolve and adapt. We and our third-party vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems, or confidential data, or to disrupt operations. None of these attempts has individually or in aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent the unauthorized access of our systems and data, or the disruption of our operations, either of which could have a material impact. Our security procedures, which include among others, virus protection software, cybersecurity and our business continuity planning, including disaster recovery policies and back-up systems, may not be adequate or implemented properly to fully address the adverse effect of cybersecurity attacks on our systems, which could adversely impact our operations.\nWe maintain property, casualty and cybersecurity insurance that may cover certain resultant cyber and physical damage or third-party injuries caused by potential cyber events. However, damage and claims arising from such incidents may exceed the amount of any insurance available and other damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered at all. For these reasons, a significant cyber incident could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.\nTerrorist attacks, and the threat of terrorist attacks, have resulted in increased costs to our business. Continued hostilities or sustained military campaigns may adversely impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe long-term impact of terrorist attacks and the magnitude of the threat of future terrorist attacks on the electric utility and natural gas midstream industry in general, and on us in particular, cannot be known. Increased security measures taken by us as a precaution against possible terrorist attacks have resulted in increased costs to our business. Uncertainty surrounding continued hostilities or sustained military campaigns may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of supplies and markets for our products, and the possibility that our infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror. Changes in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks may make certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain. Moreover, the insurance that may be available to us may be significantly more expensive than existing insurance coverage.\nWe face risks related to health epidemics and other outbreaks.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 continues to be a developing situation around the globe that has adversely impacted economic activity and conditions worldwide. In particular, efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 have led to shutdowns of various facilities as well as disrupted supply chains around the world. Efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 have also resulted in remote work arrangements, increased unemployment, customer slow payment or non-payment and decreased commercial and industrial load in the U.S. generally and in our service territory to a lesser extent. We expect these particular COVID-19 impacts will likely continue in the near future. We are continuing to monitor developments involving our workforce, customers and suppliers and cannot predict whether COVID-19 will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects. However, an extended slowdown of the United States' economic growth, demand for commodities and/or material changes in governmental policy could result in lower economic growth and lower demand for electricity in our key markets as well as the ability of various customers, contractors, suppliers and other business partners to fulfill their obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Further, the negative impacts on the economy could also adversely impact the market value of the assets that fund our pension plans, which could necessitate accelerated funding of the plans to meet minimum federal government requirements.\nThe effects of COVID-19 and concerns regarding its continued global spread have negatively impacted domestic and international demand for natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, which has and could continue to contribute to price volatility and materially and adversely affect Enable's customers' operations and future production, resulting in less demand for Enable's services and/or the reduction of commercial opportunities that might otherwise be available to Enable. In response to sharp declines in demand for oil and gas as well as commodity prices resulting from the economic impact of COVID-19, many producers have significantly reduced previously anticipated drilling and production activities and may make additional reductions in the future. Decreased demand for commodities as a result of COVID-19 impacted the valuation of OGE Energy's\ninvestment in Enable, resulting in an impairment charge in March 2020 that had a material adverse impact on OGE Energy's results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. Further, OGE Energy's operating cash flow is derived partially from cash distributions it receives from Enable. In response to current industry conditions, Enable reduced its dividend distribution by half, effective April 1, 2020. Prolonged decreased demand for commodities and/or further reductions in distributions from Enable could materially adversely affect OGE Energy's results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the ongoing impact that COVID-19 will have on our customers, suppliers, vendors and other business partners and each of their financial conditions; however, any material effect on these parties could adversely impact us. The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate the other risks discussed within this Form 10-K, any of which could have a material effect on us. As this situation continues and can change rapidly, additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\nWe face certain human resource risks associated with the availability of trained and qualified labor to meet our future staffing requirements.\nWorkforce demographic issues challenge employers nationwide and are of particular concern to the electric utility industry. The median age of utility workers is higher than the national average. Over the next three years, 20 percent of our current employees will meet the eligibility requirements to retire. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents have anti-takeover effects.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as the Oklahoma corporation statute, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of OGE Energy. Such provisions, including those regulating the nomination of directors, limiting who may call special stockholders' meetings and eliminating stockholder action by written consent, together with the possible issuance of preferred stock of OGE Energy without stockholder approval, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our Board of Directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of our common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in such stockholder's best interest.\nWe may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our indebtedness.\nThe terms of the indentures governing our debt securities do not fully prohibit OGE Energy or OG&E from incurring additional indebtedness. If we are in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in our revolving credit agreements and the indentures governing our debt securities, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness. If we incur additional indebtedness, the related risks that we now face may intensify.\nAny reductions in our credit ratings or changes in benchmark interest rates could increase our financing costs and the cost of maintaining certain contractual relationships or limit our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms.\nWe cannot assure you that any of the current credit ratings of the Registrants will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Our ability to access the commercial paper market could be adversely impacted by a credit ratings downgrade or major market disruptions. Pricing grids associated with our credit facilities could cause annual fees and borrowing rates to increase if an adverse rating impact occurs. The impact of any future downgrade could include an increase in the costs of our short-term borrowings, but a reduction in our credit ratings would not result in any defaults or accelerations. Any future downgrade could also lead to higher long-term borrowing costs and, if below investment grade, would require us to post collateral or letters of credit.\nFurther, changes in benchmark interest rates, such as the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority's announcement that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021, could result in increased financing costs. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index. If the method for calculation of LIBOR changes, if LIBOR is no longer available or if lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, OGE Energy and OG&E may incur increases in interest rates on any borrowings and/or may need to renegotiate our credit facilities that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established.\nOur debt levels may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.\nWe have revolving credit agreements for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other corporate purposes. The levels of our debt could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022the ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms;\n\u2022a portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities; and\n\u2022our debt levels may limit our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of our key customers and counterparties, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our key customers and counterparties could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to credit risks in our generation and retail distribution operations. Credit risk includes the risk that counterparties who owe us money or energy will breach their obligations. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, we may be forced to enter into alternative arrangements. In that event, our financial results could be adversely affected, and we could incur losses.", "PERMNO": 24440, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "OGE"}
