Any of the risk factors described below or elsewhere in this report could significantly and adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect us.\nRisks related to our financial results and Company success\nOur revenue for a particular period can be difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.\nAs a result of the many factors discussed in this report, our revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict and will fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Typically, our customers request product delivery within a short period following receipt of an order. Consequently, we do not typically carry a significant order backlog and are dependent upon obtaining orders and completing delivery in accordance with shipping terms that are predominantly within each quarter to achieve our targeted revenues. Our net revenue may grow at a slower rate than in previous quarters or may decline. Our deployment/installation cycle can vary depending on the customer\u2019s schedule, site readiness, network size and complexity and other factors, which can cause our revenue to fluctuate from period to period. Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be affected if the variable revenue patterns seen in prior quarters recur in future quarters. We have experienced periods of time during which manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to variable shipping patterns. In addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in quarters in which we and our subcontractors are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected, and we may not be able to remediate the conditions within the same quarter.\nIn the past, under certain market conditions, long manufacturing lead times have caused our customers to place the same order multiple times. When multiple ordering occurs, along with other factors, it may cause difficulty in predicting our sales and, as a result, could impair our ability to manage inventory effectively.\nWe plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expenses in response to short-term business changes.\nThe lengthy sales and approval process required by major and other service providers for new products could result in fluctuations in our revenue.\nIn the industry in which we compete, sales and approval cycles are often lengthy. Selling efforts often involve a significant commitment of time and resources by us and our customers that may include extensive product testing, laboratory or network certification, or region-specific product certification and homologation requirements for deployment in networks. Additionally, a supplier must first obtain product approval from a major or other service provider to sell its products to these service providers. This process can last from six to eighteen months, or longer, depending on the technology, the service provider and the demand for the product from the service provider\u2019s subscribers. Consequently, we are involved in a constant process of submitting for approval succeeding generations of products, as well as products that deploy new technology or respond to new technology demands from a major or other service provider. We have been successful in the past in obtaining these approvals; however, we cannot be certain that we will obtain these approvals in the future or that sales of these products will continue to occur. Any attempt by a major or other service provider to seek out additional or alternative suppliers, or to undertake, as permitted under applicable regulations, the production of these products internally, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Furthermore, the delay in sales until the completion of the approval process, the length of which is difficult to predict, could result in fluctuations of revenue and uneven operating results from quarter to quarter or year to year. Further, once customer approval or certifications are met, our supply chain customers typically do not guarantee us a minimum, or any, volume of sales. We are dependent on individual purchase orders as discussed elsewhere in this report.\nWe depend heavily on sales to certain customers; the loss of any of these customers would significantly reduce our revenues and net income.\nHistorically, a large percentage of our sales have been made to major service providers and larger independent communications companies. In 2020, these customers continued to comprise over half of our revenue. As long as the major and larger independent communications companies represent such a substantial percentage of our total revenue, our future success will significantly depend upon certain factors which are not within our control, including:\n\u2022the timing and size of future purchase orders, if any, from these customers;\n\u2022changes in strategic plans and capital budgets of these customers;\n\u2022the product requirements of these customers;\n\u2022the subscriber take rate, including subscriber loss or churn, of our customers;\n\u2022the financial and operational success of these customers;\n\u2022the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on these customers;\n\u2022consolidation, acquisition of, or corporate reorganization among these customers;\n\u2022the success of these customers' services deployed using our products; and\n\u2022the impact of work stoppages at these customers.\nIn the past, sales to our large customers have fluctuated, and may fluctuate in the future, significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. The loss of, or a significant reduction or delay in, sales to any such customer or the occurrence of sales fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, any attempt by a major or other service provider to seek out additional or alternative suppliers or to undertake, as permitted under applicable regulations, the production of these products internally, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions or are unable to continue operations. This could lead to variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow. In addition, particularly in the service provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers, with the effect that a loss of a major customer could have a material impact on our results that we would not have anticipated in a marketplace composed of more numerous participants.\nOur exposure to the credit risks of our customers and distributors may make it difficult to collect accounts receivable and could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nMost of our revenue is made on an open credit basis, generally with payment terms of 30 days in the U.S. and typically longer in many geographic markets outside the U.S. As our international revenue grows, our total accounts receivable balance will likely increase. Our DSO could also increase as a result of a greater mix of international revenue. Additionally, international laws may not provide the same degree of protection against defaults on accounts receivable as provided under U.S. laws governing domestic transactions; therefore, as our international business grows, we may be subject to higher bad debt expense compared to historical trends. Overall, we monitor individual customer and distributor payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts that we believe customers and distributors can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts and other macroeconomic indicators. In the course of our sales to customers and distributors, we may encounter difficulty collecting accounts receivable and could be exposed to risks associated with uncollectible accounts receivable due to various reasons, including potential declining operating cash flows or bankruptcy filings. While we attempt to monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take appropriate measures to collect accounts receivable balances, there are no assurances we can avoid write-downs and/or write-offs of accounts receivable as a result of declining financial conditions for our customers, including bankruptcy. Such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur and could potentially have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe expect gross margins to vary over time, and our levels of product and services gross margins may not be sustainable.\nOur level of gross margins may not be sustainable and may be adversely affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in customer, geographic or product or services mix, including software and the mix of configurations and professional services revenue within each product segment;\n\u2022\nmix of domestic versus international revenue;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products by competitors, including products with price-performance advantages;\n\u2022\nour ability to reduce product cost;\n\u2022\nincreases in labor or material cost, including increases in material costs resulting from tariffs;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate movements;\n\u2022\nexpediting costs incurred to meet customer delivery requirements;\n\u2022\nexcess inventory and inventory holding charges;\n\u2022\nexcess and obsolescence charges;\n\u2022\nchanges in shipment volume;\n\u2022\nour ability to absorb fixed manufacturing costs during short-term fluctuations in customer demand;\n\u2022\nloss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing or charges incurred due to inventory holding periods if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand;\n\u2022\nlower than expected benefits from value engineering;\n\u2022\nincreased price competition, including competitors from Asia, specifically China;\n\u2022\nchanges in distribution channels;\n\u2022\nincreased warranty cost;\n\u2022\nliquidated damages costs relating to customer contractual terms; and\n\u2022\nour ability to manage the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations relating to our revenue or cost of goods sold.\nOur dependence on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, key components and ODM products may prevent us from delivering our products on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on customer relations and operating results.\nCertain raw materials and key components used in our products are currently available from only one source, and others are available from only a limited number of sources. The availability of these raw materials and supplies may be subject to market forces beyond our control, such as merger and acquisition activity of our suppliers and consolidation in some segments of our supplier base. From time to time, there may not be sufficient quantities of raw materials and supplies in the marketplace to meet customer demand. Many companies utilize the same raw materials and supplies that we do in the production of their products. Companies with more resources than our own may have a competitive advantage in obtaining raw materials and supplies due to greater buying power. These factors can result in reduced supply, higher prices of raw materials and delays in the receipt of certain of our key components, which in turn may generate increased costs, lower margins and delays in product delivery, with a corresponding adverse effect on revenues and customer relationships. We attempt to manage these risks through developing alternative sources, by staging inventories at strategic locations, through engineering efforts designed to obviate the necessity of certain components and by building long-term relationships and close contact with each of our key suppliers; however, we cannot assure that delays in or failures of deliveries of key components, either to us or to our contract manufacturers, and consequent delays in product deliveries, will not occur in the future. For a discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our supply chain see \u201c- The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nWe compete in markets that have become increasingly competitive, which may result in reduced gross profit margins and market share.\nThe markets for our products are intensely competitive. Additional manufacturers have entered the markets in recent years to offer products in competition with us. Additionally, certain companies have, in recent years, developed the ability to deliver competing products using coaxial cable and cellular transmission, especially in high-density metropolitan areas. Competition will further increase if new companies enter the market or existing competitors expand their product lines. Some of these potential competitors may have greater financial, technological, manufacturing, sales and marketing, and personnel resources than we have. As a result, these competitors may be able to respond more rapidly or effectively to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, withstand significant price decreases, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.\nIn addition, our present and future competitors may be able to enter our existing or future markets with products or technologies comparable or superior to those that we offer. An increase in competition could cause us to reduce prices, decrease our market share, require increased spending by us on product development and sales and marketing, or cause delays or cancellations in customer orders, any one of which could reduce our gross profit margins and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, installation and shipment volumes, field service repair obligations and other rework costs incurred in correcting product failures. If our estimates change, our liability for warranty obligations may increase or decrease, impacting future cost of goods sold.\nOur products are highly complex, and we cannot ensure that our extensive product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect all defects, errors, failures and quality issues. Quality or performance problems for products covered under warranty could adversely impact our reputation and negatively affect our operating results, financial position and cash flows. The development and production of new products with high complexity often involves problems with software, components and manufacturing methods. If significant warranty obligations arise due to reliability or quality issues arising from defects in software, faulty components or manufacturing methods, our operating results, financial position and cash flows could be negatively impacted by:\n\u2022\ncosts associated with fixing software or hardware defects;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with internal or third-party installation errors;\n\u2022\nhigh service and warranty expenses;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with recalling and replacing products with software or hardware defects, including costs from writing-off defective products recalled;\n\u2022\nhigh inventory obsolescence expense;\n\u2022\ndelays in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\npayment of liquidated damages for performance failures;\n\u2022\nextended performance bond expenses; and\n\u2022\na decline in sales to existing customers.\nManaging our inventory is complex and may include write-downs of excess or obsolete inventory.\nManaging our inventory of components and finished products is complicated by a number of factors, including the need to maintain a significant inventory of certain components that are in short supply, that have been discontinued by the component manufacturer, that must be purchased in bulk to obtain favorable pricing or that require long lead times. These issues may result in our purchasing and maintaining significant amounts of inventory, which if not used or expected to be used based on anticipated production requirements, may become excess or obsolete. Any excess or obsolete inventory could also result in sales price reductions and/or inventory write- downs, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe continuing growth of our international operations could expose us to additional risks, increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are expanding our presence in international markets, which represented 30.5% of our net revenue for 2020, and as a result, we anticipate increased sales and operating costs in these markets. This international expansion may increase our operational risks and impact our results of operations, including: exposure to unfavorable commercial terms in certain countries; the time and cost to staff and manage foreign operations, including the time and cost to maintain good relationships with employee associations and works councils;\n\u2022\nexposure to unfavorable commercial terms in certain countries;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost to staff and manage foreign operations, including the time and cost to maintain good relationships with employee associations and works councils;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost to ensure adequate business interruption controls, processes and facilities;\n\u2022\nthe time and cost to manage and evolve financial reporting systems, maintain effective financial disclosure controls and procedures, and comply with corporate governance requirements in multiple jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nthe cost to collect accounts receivable and extension of collection periods;\n\u2022\nthe cost and potential disruption of facilities transitions required in some business acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrisks as a result of less regulation of patents or other safeguards of intellectual property in certain countries;\n\u2022\nthe potential impact of adverse tax, customs regulations and transfer-pricing issues;\n\u2022\nexposure to increased price competition from additional competitors in some countries;\n\u2022\nexposure to global social, political and economic instability, changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rate movements;\n\u2022\npotential exposure to liability or damage of reputation resulting from a higher incidence of corruption or unethical business practices in some countries;\n\u2022\npotential regulations on data protection, regarding the collection, use, disclosure and security of data;\n\u2022\npotential trade protection measures, export compliance issues, domestic preference procurement requirements, qualification to transact business and additional regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\npotential exposure to natural disasters, epidemics and pandemics (and government regulations in response thereto) and acts of war or terrorism.\nIf we are unable to successfully address the potential risks associated with our overall international expansion, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows may be negatively impacted.\nIf we are unable to integrate future acquisitions successfully, it could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may make acquisitions to improve or expand our product offerings, customer base, talent or intellectual property. Our current and future acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate acquisitions. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating and managing the operations, technologies and products of the companies we acquire;\n\u2022\nour inability to maintain the key business relationships and the brand equity of businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\nour inability to retain key personnel of the acquired business; and\n\u2022\nour responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire, some of which we may not anticipate, including costs of third-party advisors to resolve disputes.\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining key personnel.\nOur business has grown significantly since its inception. Our success is dependent in large part on the continued employment of our executive officers, including Thomas R. Stanton, our Chief Executive Officer, and other key management personnel. The unplanned departure of one or more of these individuals could adversely affect our business. In addition, for ADTRAN to continue as a successful entity we must also be able to attract and retain key engineers and software developers and architects whose expertise helps us maintain competitive advantages. We believe that our future success will depend, in large part, upon our ability to continue to attract, retain, train and motivate highly-skilled employees who are in great demand. Stock awards are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions and to provide incentives for them to remain with us. Changes to our overall compensation program, including our stock incentive program, may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees. Properly managing our continued growth, avoiding the problems often resulting from such growth and expansion and continuing to operate in the manner which has proven successful to us to date will be critical to the future success of our business.\nIf we fail to manage our exposure to worldwide financial and securities markets successfully, our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted.\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and prices of marketable equity and fixed-income securities. The global macroeconomic environment has been challenging and inconsistent due to uncertainty in the global central bank monetary policy and uncertainty in global credit markets and the geopolitical environment in many areas of the world. The primary objective of the majority of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time achieving appropriate yields without significantly increasing risk. To achieve this objective, a majority of our marketable securities are investment grade corporate and municipal fixed-rate bonds, U.S. government bonds and municipal money market instruments denominated in U.S. dollars. While we do invest a portion of our investment portfolio in equities, which are subject to market risks, including the loss of principal, our equity investments are generally invested in professionally-managed portfolios with the objective of exceeding the performance of their underlying benchmarks.\nWe have significant investments in corporate bonds, municipal fixed-rate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage/agency-backed bonds, U.S. government bonds and foreign government bonds. Through December 31, 2020, we have not been required to impair any of these investments; however, we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity in these investments, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Fixed-rate interest securities may have their fair value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while variable-rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Our investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks, which may increase because of conditions in the financial markets and related credit liquidity issues. Consequently, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates, or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in fair value due to changes in interest rates.\nSee \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this report, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d in Part II, Item 7A of this report and Note 6 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for more information about our investments\nRisks related to COVID-19\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19, a pandemic. COVID-19 continues to spread and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to contain the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. While we are unable to accurately predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures, our compliance with these measures has impacted, and may continue to impact, our day-to-day operations and could continue to disrupt our business and operations, as well as that of our customers, suppliers (including contract manufacturers) and other counterparties, for an indefinite period of time. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions in our supply chain, including a slow-down in supply chain deliveries and some raw material and freight-related cost increases as a result of the pandemic.\nTo support the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities, a majority of our employees are working remotely as of February 26, 2021. However, there is risk that a number of our employees could be infected with COVID-19, including our key personnel. In addition, many of our customers, suppliers and other counterparties are working remotely, which may delay the timing of some orders and expected deliveries. The disruptions to our operations caused by COVID-19 may result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our product development, sales, marketing and customer service efforts that we cannot fully mitigate through remote or other alternative work arrangements. These additional costs may be partially offset by reduced travel expenses as a result of travel restrictions that we have in place, as well as lower marketing-related costs.\nMore generally, the global pandemic has caused a significant economic downturn and volatility in financial markets, which could affect demand for our products and services and impact our results and financial condition even after the pandemic is contained and the shelter-in-place orders are lifted. For example, we may be unable to collect receivables from those customers significantly impacted by COVID-19. Also, a decrease in orders could negatively affect our revenues in future periods, particularly if experienced on a sustained basis.\nAlthough we expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our domestic and international working capital needs and other capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months, if our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nMoreover, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate other pre-existing risks, such as political, regulatory, social, financial, operational and cybersecurity risks, and those associated with global economic conditions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business.\nRisks related to our control environment\nWe are currently in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) software solution. If we do not effectively implement this project, or any future associated updates, our operations could be significantly disrupted.\nWe are currently in the process of implementing of a new ERP software solution. This project requires us to migrate and reconfigure all of our current system processes, transactions, data and controls to a new cloud-based platform and is expected to have a significant impact on our business processes, financial reporting, information systems and internal controls. This has required, and will continue to require, significant change management, meaningful investment in capital and personnel resources and coordination of numerous software and system providers and internal business teams. We may experience difficulties, including delays and higher than anticipated costs related to personnel and capital resources, as we manage these changes and transition to this new ERP solution, including loss or corruption of data, delayed shipments, delayed financial reporting, decreases in productivity as our personnel implement and become familiar with the new systems and processes, unanticipated expenses (including increased costs of implementation, costs of conducting business or the potential impairment of previously capitalized ERP implementation costs) and lost revenue. Once implemented, we will have cloud driven quarterly updates. Although we will conduct design validations and user testing, these may cause delays in transacting our business due to system challenges, limitations in functionality, inadequate change management or process deficiencies in the production and use of the system. Difficulties in implementing this new ERP solution or the related quarterly updates could disrupt our operations, divert management\u2019s attention from key strategic initiatives and have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nBreaches of our information systems and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property and cause significant damage to our business and reputation.\nWe maintain sensitive data on our information systems and the networks of third-party providers, including intellectual property, financial data and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business, customers, suppliers and business partners. We also produce networking equipment solutions and software used by network operators to ensure security and reliability in their management and transmission of data. Our customers, particularly those in regulated industries, are increasingly focused on the security features of our technology solutions. Maintaining the security of information sensitive to us and our business partners is critical to our business and reputation. We rely upon a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key operations and financial functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical. Companies are increasingly subjected to cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access. We have a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, which includes prevention, detection, containment and response. Our layered defense approach encompasses proactive security monitoring of our global infrastructure by both internal solutions and multiple third-party Security Operation Centers. Additionally, we routinely perform patch management, vulnerability scans and continuous monitoring across our entire enterprise. Our security policy framework includes meaningful and enforceable Information Security policies and procedures. The cybersecurity program is aligned with our mission and business objectives, reviewed periodically for improvements and is supported by experienced and certified security professionals. This is supplemented by an information security awareness program spanning our global workforce. Despite this, our network and storage applications and those systems and storage applications maintained by our third-party providers may be subject to unauthorized access by cyber-attack or breached due to operator error, fraudulent activity or other system disruptions. For example, although no indicators of compromise were identified by the Company in response to the SolarWinds Orion cybersecurity breach, we cannot absolutely assure that a future malware attack will not be successful in breaching our system and in turn, have a material impact to the Company. Additionally, in some cases, it is difficult to anticipate or immediately detect damage caused by such incidents. Unauthorized access or disclosure of our information could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. Our information systems are designed to appropriate industry standards to reduce downtime in the event of\npower outages, weather or climate events and cybersecurity issues. The Company carries two cybersecurity insurance policies meant to limit its risk and exposure should one of these cybersecurity issues occur. However, a significant failure of our systems due to these issues could result in significant remediation costs, disrupt business operations and divert management attention, which could result in harm to our business reputation, operating results, financial condition and cash flow.\nWhile we have remediated the previously identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, any future material weakness, if not remediated, materially adversely affect us.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSection 404\u201d) requires us to include in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K an assessment by the Company\u2019s management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a report from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404. Our compliance with Section 404 may require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. In addition, if management or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements, which could have an adverse effect on our stock price or lead to litigation claims.\nOur initiatives to remediate a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting identified in the future may not prove successful, and management may not be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Furthermore, even if management were to reach a conclusion that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, if our independent registered public accounting firm or the PCAOB is not satisfied with the adequacy of our controls, or if the independent registered public accounting firm interprets the requirements, rules or regulations differently than we do, then they in the future may decline to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting or may issue a report that is qualified. Any of these events could result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could negatively affect the price of our common stock.\nRisks related to the telecommunications industry\nWe must continue to update and improve our products and develop new products to compete and to keep pace with improvements in communications technology.\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and continuing improvements in the communications service offerings of service providers. If technologies or standards applicable to our products, or service provider offerings based on our products, become obsolete or fail to gain widespread commercial acceptance, our existing products or products under development may become obsolete or unmarketable. Moreover, the introduction of products embodying new technologies, the emergence of new industry standards, or changes in service provider offerings could adversely affect our ability to sell our products. For instance, we offer a large number of products that apply primarily to the delivery of high-speed digital communications over the local loop utilizing copper wire. We compete favorably with our competitors by developing a high-performance line of these products. We market products that apply to fiber optic transport in the local loop. We expect, however, that use of coaxial cable and fixed and mobile wireless access in place of local loop access will increase. Also, MSOs are increasing their presence in the local loop. To meet the requirements of these new delivery systems and to maintain our market position, we expect to continue to develop new products and/or modify existing products. We expect that the addition of fiber-based products focused on the cable MSO operators, using EPON and RFoG technologies, and fixed wireless access solutions will better position us to benefit from spending in these adjacent markets.\nOur revenue and profitability in the past have, to a significant extent, resulted from our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards and service provider offerings, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products. Our continued ability to adapt will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and our prospects for growth. We cannot assure that we will be able to respond effectively to changes in technology, industry standards, service provider offerings or new product announcements by our competitors. We also cannot assure that we will be able to successfully develop and market new products or product enhancements, or that these products or enhancements will achieve market acceptance. Any failure by us to continue to anticipate or respond in a cost-effective and timely manner to changes in technology, industry standards, service provider offerings or new product announcements by our competitors, or any significant delays in product development or introduction, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to competitively market our products and on our revenues, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable environmental regulations could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe manufacture, assembly and testing of our products may require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to environmental, health and safety regulations. Our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with any of these applicable requirements could result in regulatory penalties, legal claims or disruption of production. In addition, our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to properly manage the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage, recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could subject us to increased costs or liabilities. Existing and future environmental regulations may restrict our use of certain materials to manufacture, assemble and test products. Any of these consequences could adversely impact our results of operations by increasing our expenses and/or requiring us to alter our manufacturing processes.\nIf our products do not interoperate with our customers\u2019 networks, installations may be delayed or canceled, which could harm our business.\nOur products must interface with existing networks, each of which may have different specifications, utilize multiple protocol standards and incorporate products from other vendors. Many of our customers\u2019 networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved. Our products may be required to interoperate with many or all of the products within these networks, as well as future products to meet our customers\u2019 requirements. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers\u2019 networks, we may have to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will interoperate with the existing software and hardware. Implementation of product corrections involving interoperability issues could increase our costs and adversely affect our results of operations. Such issues may affect our ability to obtain product acceptance from other customers.\nWe engage in research and development activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application of developed technologies, and as a consequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially greater research and development efforts and which may focus on more leading edge development.\nWe engage in research and development activities to develop new, innovative solutions and to improve the application of developed technologies, and as a consequence may miss certain market opportunities enjoyed by larger companies with substantially greater research and development efforts. A portion of our research and development activities are focused on the continued innovation of currently accepted access technologies in order to deliver faster internet speeds, more capacity, better quality of service and operational efficiency. These research and development efforts result in improved applications of technologies for which demand already exists or is latent. We also focus our research and development efforts on developing software, solutions and platforms that enable service providers to increase revenue-generating service velocity, reducing operational costs, increasing scale and providing service agility. We rarely engage in research projects that represent a vast departure from the current business practices of our key customers. While we believe our strategy provides a higher likelihood of producing nearer term or more sustainable revenue streams, this strategy could result in lost revenue opportunities and higher operating expenses should a new technology achieve rapid and widespread market acceptance. When we do engage in research and development activities for new, leading-edge technologies and market approaches, there is no guarantee that those technologies or market approaches will be successful or that they will be adopted and purchased by our customers.\nOur strategy of outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing requirements to subcontractors located in various international regions may result in us not meeting our cost, quality or performance standards.\nWe are heavily dependent on subcontractors for the assembly and testing of certain printed circuit board assemblies, subassemblies, chassis, enclosures and equipment shelves, and the purchase of some raw materials used in such assemblies. This reliance involves several risks, including the unavailability of, or interruptions in, access to certain process technologies and reduced control over product quality, delivery schedules, transportation, manufacturing yields and costs. We may not be able to provide product order volumes to our subcontractors that are high enough to achieve sufficient cost savings. If shipments fall below forecasted levels, we may incur increased costs or be required to take ownership of excess inventory. Changes in international tariff structures could adversely impact our product costs. In addition, a significant component of maintaining cost competitiveness is the ability of our subcontractors to adjust their costs to compensate for possible adverse exchange rate movements. To the extent that the subcontractors are unable to do so, and we are unable to procure alternative product supplies, then our competitiveness and results of operations could be adversely impaired. These risks may be exacerbated by economic, regulatory or political changes or uncertainties, terrorist actions, the effects of climate change, natural disasters or pandemics in the foreign countries in which our subcontractors are located. We do not utilize contract manufacturing for our products in China, though we do source some ODM products from China which are, or may become, subject to import tariffs. Additionally, concerns and additional costs associated with import tariffs imposed on certain products from China has resulted in manufacturers seeking to secure production capabilities outside of China, including in countries where we currently utilize contract manufacturing.\nTo date, we believe that we have successfully managed the risks of our dependence on these subcontractors through a variety of efforts, which include seeking and developing alternative subcontractors while maintaining existing relationships; however, we cannot be assured that delays in product deliveries will not occur in the future because of shortages resulting from this limited number of subcontractors or from the financial or other difficulties of these parties. Our inability to develop alternative subcontractors if and as required in the future, or the need to undertake required retraining and other activities related to establishing and developing a new subcontractor relationship, could result in delays or reductions in product shipments which, in turn, could have a negative effect on our customer relationships and operating results.\nOur failure to maintain rights to intellectual property used in our business could adversely affect the development, functionality and commercial value of our products.\nOur future success depends in part upon our proprietary technology. Although we attempt to protect our proprietary technology by contract, trademark, copyright and patent registration and internal security, including trade secret protection, these protections may not be adequate. Furthermore, our competitors can develop similar technology independently without violating our proprietary rights. From time to time, we receive and may continue to receive notices of claims alleging that we are infringing upon patents or other intellectual property. Any of these claims, whether with or without merit, could result in significant legal fees, divert our management\u2019s time, attention and resources, delay our product shipments or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. We cannot predict whether we will prevail in any claims or litigation over alleged infringements, or whether we will be able to license any valid and infringed patents, or other intellectual property, on commercially reasonable terms. If a claim of intellectual property infringement against us is successful and we fail to obtain a license or develop or license non-infringing technology, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be affected adversely.\nSoftware under license from third parties for use in certain of our products may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe integrate third-party software into certain of our products. Licenses for this technology may not be available or continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. Difficulties with third-party technology licensors could result in the termination of such licenses, which may result in increased costs or require us to purchase or develop a substitute technology. Difficulty obtaining and maintaining third-party technology licenses may disrupt the development of our products and increase our costs, which could harm our business.\nOur use of open source software could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products.\nSeveral of our solutions utilize elements of open source or publicly available software. Although we closely monitor our use of open source software, the terms of many open source software licenses have not been interpreted by the courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to sell our products. In such event, we could be required to make our proprietary software generally available to third parties, including competitors, at no cost, to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or at all, any of which could adversely affect our revenues and operating expenses.\nWe may incur liabilities or become subject to litigation that would have a material effect on our business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we accept purchase orders, and enter into sales and other related contracts, for the marketing, sale, manufacture, distribution or use of our products and services. We may incur liabilities relating to our performance under such agreements, or which result from damage claims arising from certain events as outlined within the particular contract. While we attempt to include reasonable limitations of liability and other protective measures to all agreements, such agreements may not always contain, or be subject to, maximum loss clauses and liabilities arising from them may result in significant adverse changes to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including employment disputes, patent claims, disputes over contract agreements and other commercial disputes. In some cases, claimants seek monetary recovery, or other relief, including damages such as royalty payments related to patents, lost profits or injunctive relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. Any such disputes may be resolved before trial, or if tried, may be resolved in our favor; however, the cost of claims sustained in litigation, and costs associated with the litigation process, may not be covered by our insurance. Such costs, and the demands on management time during such an event, could harm our business, reputation and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nConsolidation and deterioration in the CLEC market could result in a significant decrease in our revenue.\nWe sell a moderate volume of products directly or indirectly to CLECs who compete with the established ILEC. The CLEC market is experiencing a process of consolidation. Many of our CLEC customers do not have a strong financial position and have limited ability to access the public financial markets for additional funding for growth and operations. If one or more of these CLECs fail, we could face a loss in revenue and an increased bad debt expense, due to their inability to pay outstanding invoices, as well as the corresponding decrease in customer base and future revenue. Furthermore, significant portions of our sales to CLECs are made through independent distributors. The failure of one or more CLECs could also negatively affect the financial position of a distributor to the point that the distributor could also experience business failure and/or default on payments to us.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and maintain relationships with SIs, service providers and enterprise VARs, our sales may be negatively affected.\nAs part of our sales strategy, we are targeting SIs, service providers and enterprise VARs. In addition to specialized technical expertise, SIs, service providers and VARs typically offer sophisticated service capabilities that are frequently desired by enterprise customers. To expand our distribution channel to include resellers with such capabilities, we must be able to provide effective support to these resellers. If our sales, marketing or service capabilities are not sufficient to provide effective support to such SIs, service providers and VARs, our sales may be negatively affected, and current SI, service provider and VAR partners may terminate their relationships with us, which would adversely impact our sales and overall results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nRisks related to the Company\u2019s stock price\nOur operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which may adversely affect our stock price.\nOur operating results have been, and will continue to be, subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations as a result of numerous factors. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for our products and services, especially with respect to significant network expansion projects undertaken by service providers;\n\u2022\ncontinued growth of communications network traffic and the adoption of communication services and applications by enterprise and consumer end users;\n\u2022\nchanges in sales and implementation cycles for our products and reduced visibility into our customers\u2019 spending plans and associated revenue, especially should a slowdown in communications industry spending occur due to economic downturns, tight capital markets, or declining liquidity trends;\n\u2022\nreductions in demand for our traditional products as new technologies gain acceptance;\n\u2022\nour ability, and that of our distributors, to maintain appropriate inventory levels and related purchase commitments;\n\u2022\nprice and product competition in the communications and networking industries, which can change rapidly due to technological innovation;\n\u2022\nthe overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitors and our customers;\n\u2022\nour dependence on sales of our products by channel partners, the timing of their replenishment orders, the potential for conflicts and competition involving our channel partners and large end-user customers and the potential for consolidation among our channel partners;\n\u2022\nvariations in sales channels, product cost or mix of products and services sold;\n\u2022\ndelays in receiving acceptance, as defined under contract, from certain customers for shipments or services performed near the end of a reporting period;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain high levels of product support and professional services;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing and customer order lead times, and potential restrictions in the supply of key components;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our gross margin and the factors that contribute to this (as described above);\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve cost reductions;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our customers, channel partners and suppliers to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute on our strategy and operating plans;\n\u2022\nbenefits anticipated from our investments in engineering, sales and marketing activities;\n\u2022\nthe effects of climate change and other natural events;\n\u2022\nthe effect of political or economic conditions, including the effect of tariffs or so-called \u201ctrade wars\u201d on us and our supply chain, acts of war, terrorist attacks or other unrest in certain international markets; and\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws and regulations or accounting pronouncements.\nAs a result, operating results for a particular future period are difficult to predict, and prior results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in future periods. Any of the above-mentioned factors, or other factors discussed elsewhere in this report, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows that could adversely affect our stock price.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ADTN. Since our initial public offering in August 1994, there has been, and may continue to be, significant volatility in the market for our common stock, based on a variety of factors, including factors listed in this section, some of which are beyond our control.\nRisks related to the regulatory environments in which we do business\nWe are subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and standards governing the conduct of our business. Violations of these laws and regulations may harm our business, subject us to penalties and to other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that govern conduct by our Company, our employees and agents and the manufacture, sale and use of our products. Our inability to comply with current and evolving laws and regulations governing our business domestically and internationally may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. New and changing laws, regulations and industry practices could require us to modify our business, products or services offered, potentially in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new products, services and features. If we violate these laws and regulations, governmental authorities in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions could seek to impose civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, as well as our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThese laws and regulations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nVarious regulations and regional standards established by communications authorities and import/export control authorities that govern the manufacture, sale and use of our products. Changes in domestic or international communications regulations, tariffs, potential changes in trade policies by the U.S. and other nations, application requirements, import/export controls or expansion of regulation to new areas, including access, communications or commerce over the Internet, may affect customer demand for our products or slow the adoption of new technologies which may affect our sales. Further, the cost of complying with the evolving standards and regulations, including the cost of product re-design if necessary, or the failure to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certification such that we may not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply, may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\u2022\nCompliance with a wide variety of provincial, state, national and international laws and regulations applicable to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of data, including personal data. Foreign data protection, privacy and other laws and regulations, including GDPR, are often more restrictive than those in the U.S. These data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are varied, evolving, can be subject to significant change, may be augmented or replaced by new or additional laws and regulations and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. For example, California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act became effective in January 2020, providing new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for companies, and, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a decision that invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework as a basis for transfers of personal data from the EU to the U.S., resulting in uncertainty and potential additional compliance obligations to ensure that a valid basis under the GDPR exists for these data transfers. There is also a risk that we, directly or as the result of a third-party service provider we use, could be found to have failed to comply with the laws and regulations applicable in a jurisdiction regarding the collection, consent, handling, transfer or disposal of personal data.\n\u2022\nThe FCPA, which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making corrupt payments to foreign officials for the purpose of directing, obtaining or keeping business, and requires companies to maintain reasonable books and records and a system of internal accounting controls. The FCPA applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by employees, strategic or local partners or other representatives. Because a significant portion of our total revenues is generated from sales outside of the U.S., we have proactively implemented internally and externally focused measures and controls to address this risk. We help ensure that our employees understand the key requirements of FCPA compliance and the consequences of non-compliance through training courses and detective controls. ADTRAN senior management and employees whose responsibilities include international activities are required to complete an online training program and pass an exam every two years. We have put processes in place to help detect non-compliance through providing our employees access to a worldwide reporting \u201chotline,\u201d available by phone and online, that is maintained by a third-party provider. Finally, we perform annual reviews of our employees\u2019 expense reports and corporate credit card activity to identify possible corruption concerns. We have also implemented controls to help ensure our third-party partners and customers observe FCPA requirements. Prior to selling to new international distributors, resellers or agents, we review third-party data and check them against over 200 denied party lists from government institutions worldwide for potential FCPA concerns. We also require international distributors, resellers and agents to complete an Anti-Corruption Due Diligence Questionnaire, which is reviewed and assessed by a cross-functional compliance committee and our export-compliance function.\n\u2022\nEnvironmental, health and safety regulation governing the manufacture, assembly and testing of our products, including without limitation regulations governing the use of hazardous materials. Our failure or the failure of our contract manufacturers to properly manage the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage, recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could subject us to increased costs or liabilities. Existing and future environmental regulations may restrict our use of certain materials to manufacture, assemble and test products.\n\u2022\nRequirements by the SEC governing the disclosure of the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and procedures to identify the source of such minerals included in manufactured products. The disclosures will require us to incur additional costs to verify the origins of the identified minerals used and comply with disclosure requirements. These requirements could affect the availability of minerals used in the manufacture of a limited number of parts contained in our products. This may reduce the number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals and may affect our ability to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Our material sourcing is broad-based and multi-tiered. While we are taking steps to identify sourcing based on recommended standards for our industry, we may not be able to conclusively verify the origins for all minerals used in our products. An inability to make a sourcing determination of minerals in our products could impact our revenues and harm our financial condition should our customers require that we certify that all components used in our products are free of minerals from this region.\nChanges in trade policy in the U.S. and other countries, specifically the U.K. and China, including the imposition of additional tariffs and the resulting consequences, may adversely impact our gross profits, gross margins, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe U.S. government has imposed tariffs on a wide range of products and goods manufactured in China and imported into the U.S. These tariffs are intended to address trade imbalances, which include decreasing imports from China and encouraging increased production of these products in the U.S. These proposals have, and could continue to, result in increased customs duties and tariffs. We import an increasing percentage of our products into the U.S. from China and an increase in customs duties and tariffs with respect to these imports could negatively impact our gross profit, gross margins and results of operations. These customs duties and tariffs may also cause other U.S. trading partners to take certain actions with respect to U.S. imports in their respective countries. Any potential changes in trade policies in the U.S. and the potential actions by other countries in which we do business could adversely impact our financial performance.\nIn June 2016, the UK held a referendum, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d in which the majority of voters elected to withdraw from the EU. The UK formally departed from the EU on Friday, January 31, 2020. Negotiations between the UK and the EU are ongoing regarding the customs and trading relationship between the UK and the EU. Although the terms of withdrawal remain in negotiation, the referendum has created global economic uncertainty, including anticipation of a possible slowdown in the global economy. Brexit has resulted in, and likely will continue to result in, significant volatility in the value of the British Pound Sterling and Euro currencies. The past year has been challenging for the credit markets due to a shift from a time of quantitative easing to a time of quantitative tightening by central banks around the world. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets, remain uncertain or further deteriorate, we may experience material impacts on our business and operating results. We may also be adversely affected in ways that we do not currently anticipate.\nNew or revised tax regulations, changes in our effective tax rate, recognition of a valuation allowance or assessments arising from tax audits may have an adverse impact on our results.\nWe are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions, both domestically and internationally, in which we conduct business. Significant judgment is required in the determination of our provision for income taxes, and this determination requires the interpretation and application of complex and sometimes uncertain tax laws and regulations. Our effective tax rate may be adversely impacted by changes in the mix of earnings between jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, and by changes in tax rules and regulations. We continually monitor our deferred tax assets and when it becomes more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be recognized, a valuation allowance is recorded against those assets. In addition, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and various other jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Additionally, we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets only as the reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be recognized. As such, we may release a portion of the valuation allowance or establish a new valuation allowance based on operations in the jurisdictions in which these assets arose. Management continues to evaluate all evidence including historical operating results, the existence of losses in the most recent year, forecasted earnings, future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Should management determine that a valuation allowance is needed in the future due to not being able to absorb deferred tax assets, it would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.", "PERMNO": 80791, "SIC": 3661, "TIC": "ADTN"}
