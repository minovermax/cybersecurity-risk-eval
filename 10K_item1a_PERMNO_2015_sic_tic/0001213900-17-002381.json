In addition to the other information in this report, you should consider carefully the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business. The risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nMaterial changes in the life insurance secondary market, a relatively new and evolving market, may adversely affect our operating results, business prospects and our ability to repay our debt obligations.\nOur primary business, the purchase and ownership of life insurance policies acquired in the secondary market, is a relatively new and evolving market. The success of our business and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations depends in large part on the continued development of the secondary market for life insurance, including the accuracy of actuarial forecasting and the solvency of life insurance companies to pay the face value of the life insurance benefits, both of which will critically impact our performance. We expect that the development of the secondary market will be impacted by a variety of factors such as the interpretation of existing laws and regulations (including laws relating to insurable interests), the passage of new legislation and regulations, mortality improvement rates, updated actuarial methodologies, and mortality tables. Importantly, all of the factors that we believe will most significantly affect the development of the life insurance secondary market are beyond our control. Any material and adverse development in the life insurance secondary market could adversely affect our operating results, our access to capital, our ability to repay our various debt and other obligations, and our business prospects and viability. Because of this, an investment in our securities involves greater risk as compared to investments offered by companies with more diversified business operations in more established markets.\nThe valuation of our principal assets on our balance sheet requires us to make material assumptions that may ultimately prove to be incorrect. If our assumptions prove incorrect, we could suffer significant losses that materially and adversely affect our results of operations and eventually cause us to be in default of restrictive covenants contained in our borrowing agreements.\nOur principal asset is a portfolio of life insurance policies purchased in the secondary market, comprising approximately 79% of our total assets at December 31, 2016, and approximately 90% of our total assets at December 31, 2015. Those assets are considered \u201cLevel 3\u201d fair value measurements under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (\u201cASC 820\u201d), as there is currently no active market where we are able to observe quoted prices for identical assets. As a result, our determination of \u201cfair value\u201d for those assets on our balance sheet incorporates significant inputs that are not observable. Fair value is defined as an exit price representing the amount that would be received if assets were sold or that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement determined based on the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nA Level 3 fair value measurement is inherently uncertain and could create additional volatility in our financial statements that is not necessarily related to the performance of our underlying assets. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we estimated the fair value discount rate for our portfolio to be 10.96% and 11.09%, respectively. If in the future we determine that a higher discount rate is required to ascribe fair value to a similarly situated portfolio of life insurance policies, we could experience significant losses materially affecting our results of operations. It is also possible that significant losses of this nature could at some point cause us to be out of compliance with borrowing covenants contained in our various borrowing agreements. This could in turn result in acceleration of our loan balances under the senior credit facilities or our Series I Secured Notes and our L Bonds, which we may not be able to repay. As a result, we may be forced to seek additional debt or equity financing to repay such debt amounts, and additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIf we are unable to repay our debt when it comes due, then our senior lenders or the holders of our Series I Secured Notes and L Bonds, or both, would have the right to foreclose on our assets. For further disclosure relating to the risks associated with the valuation of our assets, see the risk factor below \u201cIf actuarial assumptions we obtain from third-party providers . . . .\u201d\nActual results from our life insurance portfolio may not match our expected results, which could adversely affect our ability to service and grow our portfolio to achieve actuarial stability.\nOur business model relies on achieving actual results that are in line with the results we expect to attain from our investments in life insurance policy assets. In this regard, we believe that the larger the portfolio we own, the greater the likelihood that we will achieve our expected results. To our knowledge, rating agencies generally suggest that portfolios of life insurance policies contain enough policies on individual lives to achieve actuarial stability in receiving expected cash flows. For instance, in a life insurance securitization methodology published in 2012, A.M. Best concluded that at least 300 lives are necessary to achieve actuarial stability, while Standard & Poor\u2019s has indicated that stability is unlikely to be achieved with less than 1,000 lives. As of December 31, 2016, we owned $1.362 million in face value of life insurance policies covering 622 lives. Accordingly, while there is a risk with a portfolio of any size that actual cash flows and yield may be less than expected, we believe that the risk we face is presently more significant given the size of our current portfolio as compared to rating agency recommendations.\nAlthough we plan to expand the number of life insurance policies we own using proceeds raised from our securities offerings, we may be unable to do so if sufficient financing is unavailable or is available only on unfavorable or unacceptable terms. Furthermore, even if our portfolio reaches a size that is actuarially stable, we still may experience differences between the actuarial models we use and actual mortalities. Differences between our expectations and actuarial models, and actual mortality results, could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results and cash flow. In such a case, we may face liquidity problems, including difficulties servicing our remaining portfolio of policies and servicing our outstanding debt obligations. Continued or material failures to meet our expected results could decrease the attractiveness of our securities in the eyes of potential investors, thereby making it even more difficult to obtain capital needed to service our portfolio, grow the portfolio to obtain desired diversification, and service our existing debt.\nWe critically rely on debt financing for our business. Any inability to borrow could adversely affect our business operations, our ability to satisfy our debt-payment obligations and, ultimately, our prospects and viability.\nTo date, we have chosen to finance our business principally through the issuance of debt, including debt incurred by our subsidiaries GWG DLP Funding III, LLC (\u201cDLP III\u201d) under a revolving senior credit facility provided by Autobahn/DZ Bank (see Note 5) and GWG DLP Funding IV, LLC (\u201cDLP IV\u201d) under a senior secured term loan with LNV Corporation (see Note 6) (individually, referred to as a \u201csenior credit facility\u201d and together, referred to as our \u201csenior credit facilities\u201d), our Series I Secured Notes and our L Bonds. Our senior credit facility with Autobahn/DZ Bank is secured by all of the assets of DLP III, has a maximum amount of $105 million, and the outstanding balance at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $0 and $65 million, respectively. Our senior credit facility with LNV Corporation is secured by all of the assets of DLP IV, has a maximum amount of $172.3 million, and the outstanding balance at December 31, 2016 was $162.7 million. Obligations under the Autobahn/DZ Bank credit facility have a scheduled maturity date of June 30, 2018, and obligations under the LNV Corporation credit facility have a maturity date of September 14, 2026. Our Series I Secured Notes and L Bonds have scheduled maturities as indicated below in the risk factor \u201cIf a significant number of holders . . . ..\u201d To date, our debt arrangements are the most important sources of financing on which our business has critically relied to grow and maintain our portfolio of life insurance policies.\nOur business model relies on continued access to financing to enable us to purchase a large and diversified portfolio of life insurance policies and pay the attendant premiums and costs of maintaining the portfolio, all while satisfying our current interest and principal repayment obligations under our senior credit facilities and other indebtedness. We expect that proceeds from our life insurance policies may first be used to satisfy our obligations, as determined by the agreement governing the senior credit facilities. Accordingly, until we achieve sufficient cash flows derived from our portfolio of life insurance policies, we expect to rely on the proceeds from our ongoing securities offerings to satisfy our ongoing financing and liquidity needs. Nevertheless, continued access to financing and liquidity under the senior credit facilities or otherwise is not guaranteed. For example, general economic conditions could limit our access to financing, as could regulatory or legal pressures exerted on us, our financiers, or those involved in the procurement of financing such as brokers, dealers, and registered investment advisors. If we are unable to borrow under the senior credit facilities or otherwise for any reason, or to renew or replace the senior credit facilities when they come due, our business would be adversely impacted and our ability to service and repay our debt obligations would be compromised, thereby negatively affecting our business prospects and perhaps our viability.\nOur investments in life insurance policies have inherent risks, including fraud and legal challenges to the validity of the policies, which we will be unable to eliminate and which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWhen we purchase a life insurance policy, we face certain risks associated with insurance fraud and other legal challenges to the validity of the policy. For example, to the extent the insured is not aware of the existence of the policy, the insured does not exist, or the insurance company does not recognize the policy, the insurance company may cancel or rescind the policy thereby causing the loss of an investment in that policy. In addition, if an insured\u2019s medical records have been altered in such a way as to shorten a life expectancy as reported, this may cause us to overpay for the related policy. Finally, we may experience legal challenges from insurance companies claiming that the insured failed to have an insurable interest at the time the policy was originally purchased or that the policy owner made fraudulent disclosures to the insurer at the time the policy was purchased (e.g., disclosures pertaining to the health status of the insured or the existence or sources of premium financing), or challenges from the beneficiaries of an insurance policy claiming that the sale of the policy to us was invalid.\nTo mitigate these risks, our origination practices and underwriting procedures include a current verification of coverage from the insurance company, a complete due-diligence investigation of the insured and accompanying medical records, a review of the life insurance policy application, and a requirement that the policy has been in force for at least two years. We also conduct a legal review of any premium financing associated with the policy to determine if an insurable interest existed at the time of its issuance. Nevertheless, these steps will not eliminate the risk of fraud or legal challenges to the life insurance policies we purchase. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, may prove our due-diligence and risk-mitigation efforts inadequate. If a significant face amount of policies were invalidated for reasons of fraud or any other reason, our results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nOur ownership of life insurance policies issued by insurers that are unable to pay claims presented to them could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation, our financial condition, or even our overall prospects.\nWe rely on the payment of policy claims by insurers as our most significant source of revenue collection. In essence, the life insurance assets we own represent the obligations of insurers to pay the benefit amount under the relevant policy upon the mortality of the insured. As a result, in our business, we face the \u201ccredit risk\u201d that a particular insurer will be financially unable to pay claims when and as they become due. Depending on how many policies we own that are issued by insurers having financial difficulties at the time a claim is presented for payment, this risk could be significant enough to have a materially adverse effect on our results of operation, our financial condition, or even our overall prospects.\nTo mitigate this credit risk, we generally purchase policies issued only by insurers with an investment-grade credit rating from one or more of Standard & Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s, or A.M. Best Company. As of December 31, 2016, 96.3% of the face value benefits of our life insurance policies were issued by insurers having an investment-grade rating (BBB or better) by Standard & Poor\u2019s. We also review our exposure to credit risk associated with our portfolio of life insurance policies when estimating its fair value. In evaluating the policies\u2019 credit risk we consider items such as insurance company solvency, credit risk indicators, and general economic conditions. Notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate credit risk exposure and to reflect this risk in our portfolio valuation, we cannot predict with any certainty whether a particular insurer will be in a financial position to satisfy amounts that it owes under life insurance policies it has issued when a claim for payment is presented.\nEvery acquisition of a life insurance policy necessarily requires us to materially rely on information provided or obtained by third parties. Any misinformation or negligence in the course of obtaining information could materially and adversely affect the value of the policies we own, our results of operation and the value of our securities.\nOur acquisition of each life insurance policy is negotiated based on variables and particular facts that are unique to the policy itself and the health of the insured. The facts we obtain about the policies and the insured at the time when the policy was applied for and obtained are based on the insured\u2019s factual representations to the insurance company, and the facts the insurance company independently obtains in the course of its own due-diligence examination, such as facts concerning the health of the insured and whether or not there is an insurable interest present when the policy was issued. Any misinformation or negligence in the course of obtaining information relating to a policy or insured could materially and adversely impact the value of the policies we own and could, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our securities.\nOur business is subject to state regulation and changes in those laws and regulations, or changes in their interpretation, could negatively affect our results of operation, financial condition and our business prospects.\nWhen we purchase a life insurance policy, we are subject to state insurance regulations. Over the past years, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of states that have adopted legislation and regulations from model laws promulgated by either the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) or by the National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL). These laws are essentially consumer protection statutes responding to abuses that arose early in the development of our industry, some of which may persist. Today, almost every state has adopted some version of either the NAIC or NCOIL model laws, which generally require the licensing of purchasers of and brokers for life insurance policies, the filing and approval of purchase agreements, and the disclosure of transaction fees. These laws also require various periodic reporting requirements and prohibit certain business practices deemed to be abusive. State statutes typically provide state regulatory agencies with significant powers to interpret, administer, and enforce the laws relating to the purchase of life insurance policies. Under statutory authority, state regulators have broad discretionary power and may impose new licensing requirements, interpret or enforce existing regulatory requirements in different ways, or issue new administrative rules, any of which could be generally adverse to our industry. Because the life insurance secondary market is relatively new and because of the history of certain abuses in the industry, we believe it is likely that state regulation will increase and grow more complex in the foreseeable future. We cannot, however, predict what any new regulation would specifically involve.\nAny adverse change in laws or regulations, or their interpretation, in one or more states in which we operate could result in our curtailment or termination of operations in such jurisdictions, or cause us to modify our operations in a way that adversely affects our results of operation. Any such action could have a corresponding material and negative impact on our financial condition and could also negatively affect our general business prospects.\nIf federal regulators or courts conclude that the purchase of life insurance in the secondary market constitutes, in all cases, a transaction in securities, we could be in violation of existing covenants under our senior credit facilities, which could result in significantly diminished access to capital. We could also face increased operational expenses. The materialization of this risk could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, our ability to repay our debt, and possibly threaten the viability of our business.\nOn occasion, the SEC has attempted to regulate the purchase of non-variable universal life insurance policies as transactions in securities under federal securities laws. In July 2010, the SEC issued a Staff Report of its Life Settlement Task Force. In that report, the Staff recommended that certain types of purchased insurance policies be classified as securities. The SEC has not taken any position on the Staff Report, and there is no indication if the SEC will take any action to implement the recommendations of the Staff Report. In addition, there have been several federal court cases in which transactions involving the purchase and fractionalization of life insurance policies have been held to be transactions in securities under the federal Securities Act of 1933.\nWe believe that the matters discussed in the Staff Report and existing case law do not impact our current business model since our purchases of life insurance policies are distinguishable from those cases that have been held by courts, and advocated by the Staff Report, to be transactions in securities. For example, neither we nor any of our affiliates are involved in the fractionalization of life insurance policies, and we presently do not purchase significant amounts of variable life insurance policies. As a practical matter, if all or a majority of our life insurance policies were deemed to be \u201csecurities\u201d under federal securities laws, either through an expansion of the definition of what constitutes a \u201csecurity,\u201d the expansion of the types of transactions in life insurance policies that would constitute transactions in \u201csecurities,\u201d or the elimination or limitation of available exemptions and exceptions (whether by statutory change, regulatory change, or administrative or court interpretation), then we or one or more of our affiliated entities could become subject to the federal Investment Company Act of 1940. This outcome would likely have a material and negative effect on our company by imposing additional regulations and rules to our governance structure, operations, and our capital structure. In particular, this outcome would likely cause us to be in violation of existing covenants under our senior credit facilities requiring us not to operate or be characterized as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This breach would likely adversely affect our liquidity and increase our cost of capital and operational expenses, all of which would adversely affect our operating results. Such an outcome could also threaten our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due and the viability of our business.\nIf actuarial assumptions we obtain from third-party providers and rely on to calculate our expected returns on our investments in life insurance policies change, our operating results and cash flow could be adversely affected, as well as the value of our collateral and our ability to service our debt obligations.\nThe expected internal rate of return we calculate is based upon the probability of an insured\u2019s mortality over an actuarial life expectancy estimate. We presently obtain these estimates from third-party medical-actuarial underwriting companies. In the case of small face policies, which we currently define as policies with $1.0 million or less in face value of policy benefits, we may choose not to obtain any estimates, and instead use proprietary mortality tables or other techniques to develop our own life expectancy for an insured. In addition to actuarial life expectancies, we rely on a pricing and premium forecasting software model developed by a third-party actuarial firm for the valuation of policies we purchase, future mortality revenues, and the calculation of anticipated internal rates of return. These pricing models forecast the estimated future premiums due as well the future mortalities of insureds.\nAll actuarial life expectancies (and related forecasting software) are subject to interpretation and change based on evolving medical technology, actuarial data, and analytical techniques. Additionally, we are required under the borrowing agreements for our $172 million credit facility to update life expectancy estimates for the applicable policies once every two years (as opposed to our current practice of updating those estimates once every three years). We cannot be certain what impact those updates will have. Nevertheless, our prior experience in updating life expectancies has generally resulted in longer life expectancies for most, but not all, of the insureds within our portfolio. Any increase in the actuarial life expectancy estimates of insureds within our portfolio could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results and cash flow, and our balance sheet. Adverse impacts on the value of our life insurance policy portfolio or our cash flow could in turn impair the value of the collateral we have pledged to our creditors and our ability to service our debt and obligations as they come due.\nWe rely on estimated rates of mortality when valuing life insurance policies and forecasting the performance of our portfolio, and we also rely on other estimates derived from statistical methodologies for projecting our future cash flows. If any of our estimates prove to be incorrect, it could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to satisfy our debt service and repayment obligations.\nIf we assume we will receive cash inflows from policies sooner than we actually do, we may not be able to make payment on our debt obligations in a timely manner, or at all. Moreover, a significant medical discovery or advance that results in mortality improvements among seniors, above historically predicted actuarial rates, could have a material adverse effect on the value of our life insurance investments.\nFor example, we use a modeling method for projecting cash flows known as the \u201cprobabilistic method.\u201d This is an actuarial method that uses the probability of an insured\u2019s mortality over time (a mortality curve) to project the flow of policy benefits to us and to project premiums that must be paid. Thus far, we have in fact experienced fewer cash flows from policy benefits than projected in the early stages of ownership of our current life insurance policy portfolio using this method. We had expected to receive approximately $242.4 million cumulative policy benefits as of December 31, 2016, and in fact received $126.3 million. This has resulted in greater than expected premium payments, increasing such expected payments from an expected $142.5 million to $151.4 million. Barring significant mortality improvements (i.e., medical discoveries or advancements relating to the medical conditions of insureds), however, the fact that actual results have differed from the expectations derived from the probabilistic method of projecting cash flows should ordinarily result in greater cash flows in later stages of ownership.\nWe update our projected future cash flows each month using the probabilistic method to reflect the actual experience within our life insurance policy portfolio to date. We use the current future cash flow projection to generate our expected internal rate of return on the life insurance policy portfolio we own. We would expect to change our method of calculating our future cash flows only if leading actuarial firms determined that such a methodology was no longer the most appropriate means of projecting cash flows from a life insurance policy portfolio. Any change to the pricing model, methodology, premium forecasting assumptions, cash flow projections, or the mortality assumptions accompanied therewith that increase the projected cost-of-insurance premiums or decrease the probability of mortality could have a material and adverse impact on our cash flows and financial condition. Ultimately, this could adversely affect our ability to meet our debt service and repayment obligations and our viability.\nCost-of-insurance (premium) increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and our profitability.\nWe are subject to the risk of increased cost-of-insurance (\u201cCOI\u201d) charges (i.e., premium charges) for the universal life insurance policies we own in our portfolio. Approximately 16% of the policies in our portfolio have premium levels that are guaranteed, under the terms of the policy, to keep the policy\u2019s death benefit in force even in a situation where the policy\u2019s cash account has been wholly depleted. On the remaining 84% of our policies we pay the \u201cnon-guaranteed COI charges,\u201d and therefore we are subject to the risk that the insurer could increase the COI charges for the policy. In all cases, the amount of increase is subject to limits set forth in the insurance policy. Because very few of the policies we own have significant cash account value balances, any COI increase will require us to use more cash to satisfy the minimum premium amount required to keep the policy in force.\nA COI increase can be expected to impair the value of the affected policy since extra expense (i.e., additional premium amounts) will be required to keep the policy in force, and such extra expense will diminish the economic value, or return, of the policy upon the mortality of the insured. As a result, any widespread COI increases in policies owned in our portfolio would likely have a material and adverse effect on the value of our portfolio, which in turn would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and our profitability.\nOur business and prospects may be adversely affected by changes, lack of growth, or increased competition in the life insurance secondary market.\nThe growth of the life insurance policy secondary market and our expansion within the market may be negatively affected by a variety of factors beyond our control, including: our inability to locate sufficient numbers of life insurance policy sellers or agents to source those sellers; our inability to convince life insurance policy owners of the benefits of selling their policy; competition from other companies in the life insurance secondary market; negative publicity about the life insurance secondary market based on actual or perceived abuses; and the adoption of additional governmental regulation.\nThe relatively new and evolving nature of the market in which we operate makes the related risks difficult to identify and quantify. Nevertheless, contractions in the secondary market for life insurance policies, whether resulting from general economic conditions, regulatory or legal pressures, or otherwise (including regulatory pressures exerted on us or others involved in the secondary market for life insurance, or involved with participants in that market), could make participation in the market generally less desirable. This could, in turn, depress the prices at which life insurance policies on the secondary market are bought and sold and have a negative impact on the estimated value of the policies we own. If the value of the policies we own decreases, our results of operations and financial condition could suffer.\nChanges in general economic conditions could adversely impact our business.\nChanges in general economic conditions, including, for example, interest rates, investor sentiment, changes specifically affecting the insurance industry, competition, technological developments, political and diplomatic events, tax laws, and other factors not known to us today, can substantially and adversely affect our business and prospects. For example, changes in interest rates may increase our cost of capital and ability to raise capital, and have a corresponding adverse impact on our operating results. While we may engage in certain hedging activities to mitigate the impact of rising interest rates, none of these risks are or will be within our control.\nWe are dependent on our information systems for our financial reporting, policy-related databases, communications and other functions. If our information systems fail or experience major interruptions, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, our business and our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our information systems to effectively manage our operational and financial functions. Our computer systems, Internet web sites, telecommunications, and data networks are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, natural disasters and attacks from viruses or hackers, including cybersecurity threats and incidents. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems to targeted measures directed at us, our databases, policies, and/or the subjects of acquired policies. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to attempt to mitigate our exposure to these risks, attacks are evolving and unpredictable and we cannot guarantee that any risk prevention measures implemented will be successful. System failures or interruptions, including those relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could breach the security of the personal information of the subjects of the acquired policies and could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and operating results.\nRisks Unique to Our Company\nWe have a relatively limited history of operations and our earnings and cash flows may be volatile, resulting in uncertainty about our ability to service and repay our debt when it comes due and uncertainty about our prospects generally.\nWe are a company with a limited history, which makes it difficult to accurately forecast our earnings and cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred a net loss of $3.1 million, and in the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred a net loss of $7.4 million. Our lack of a significant history and the evolving nature of the market in which we operate make it likely that there are risks inherent to our business that are yet to be recognized by us or others, or not fully appreciated, and that could result in us earning less than we anticipate or even suffering further losses. As a result of the foregoing, an investment in our securities necessarily involves uncertainty about the stability of our earnings, cash flows and, ultimately, our ability to service and repay our debt and our prospects generally. In addition, any earnings volatility we experience may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may in the future rely, in part, on new and unproven technology as part of our underwriting processes. If the mortality predictions we obtain through use of this technology proves inaccurate, our results of operation and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe recently exercised our option to license, on an exclusive basis for use in the life insurance industry, new technology (which we call \u201cM-Panel\u201d technology) that we believe may be applied to assist us with the mortality predictions in the course of underwriting and valuing life insurance policies. This M-Panel technology, however, has not yet been commercially applied in the manner we envision, and it is possible that we will be unable to elicit more accurate mortality predictions through its use. It is also possible that the mortality predictions we obtain through the use of this M-Panel technology will prove inaccurate, and perhaps materially so. In such a case, our failure to accurately forecast mortalities could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition, which could in turn materially and negatively affect the price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debts.\nWe may be unable to enter into a license prohibiting competitors from using the M-Panel technology, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses from other parties prior to our use of that technology. If we encounter difficulties in these regards, we may be forced to develop our own proprietary processes, the success of which may not be certain. Difficulties we encounter in our efforts to use or develop, and protect, intellectual property may prove costly and affect our results of operations.\nAlthough we recently exercised our option to exclusively license M-Panel technology for use in the life insurance industry, we have not yet entered into a written license agreement for this purpose. We continue, however, negotiating the terms and conditions of that written license agreement and assessing the scope of protection we would obtain through such an agreement. The intellectual property rights (relating to the M-Panel technology) that we have a right to license are the subject of a provisional patent, and no patent protection will be afforded those rights unless and until a non-provisional patent application is filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which filing is beyond our control. If the patent for the M-Panel technology were to issue and we were to enter into the license agreement, we would be legally entitled to prevent third parties from using any part of the technology that is both covered by the claims of the patent and licensed to us. If, on the other hand, no patent is ultimately granted with respect to the M-Panel technology (or the scope of claims is too narrow to afford us with meaningful protection), or if we are unable to enter into a license agreement, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using the M-Panel technology. This outcome may severely diminish any competitive advantage we hope to obtain through our use of the M-Panel technology.\nWe are aware that other patent applications pending in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may have scopes of claims that overlap with the claims contained in the provisional patent application filed with respect to the M-Panel technology. If those other patents were to issue with scopes of claims that in fact overlap with the claims in any patent application for the M-Panel technology, we would likely be required to enter into a license agreement with other third parties before we could use processes that are covered by those overlapping claims. We may be unable, however, to procure such a license, and even if we are able to procure such a license it may prove too costly for us. Alternatively, we would ourselves be required to develop other processes that would not overlap with other patent claims. Our own development of these processes could be costly and time consuming and may ultimately prove unsuccessful.\nIn sum, any difficulties we encounter in our efforts to use (through a license), or develop, and ultimately protect, intellectual property from which we hope to gain a competitive advantage and enter into new insurance-related markets could prove costly and time-consuming enough to materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe technology we license may subject us to claims of infringement or invalidity from third parties, and the magnitude of this risk to our business generally rises if and as we become more successful in employing and relying on the technology. Any such claims would be complex and costly, and adverse outcomes could undermine the competitive advantages we seek.\nOur reliance on M-Panel technology (or any other technology we own or license) will subject us to the risk that other parties may assert, rightly or wrongly, that our intellectual property rights are invalid or violate the rights of those parties, as well as the risk that our intellectual property rights will be infringed upon by third parties. Any outcome that invalidates our intellectual property rights or that otherwise diminishes the competitive advantages obtained, at least in part, through the use of those rights could have a material and adverse effect on our competitive position and our prospects.\nCommercializing the M-Panel or other technology may require significant expenses, may cause us to incur losses, and may ultimately prove ineffective in disrupting the life insurance and related industries in which we operate.\nWe intend to pursue new business models and business strategies in the insurance industry with M-Panel or similar technology. This M-Panel technology, however, has not yet been commercially applied in the manner we envision, and it is possible that we will incur losses as a result of these operations. The mortality predictions we obtain through M-Panel technology may prove inaccurate. In such a case, our failure to accurately forecast mortalities could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition, which could in turn materially and negatively affect the price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debts.\nWe may not be able to raise the capital that we are seeking from our securities offerings, and may be unable to meet our overall business objective of growing a larger, actuarially diverse portfolio of life insurance.\nOur offer and sale of preferred stock (e.g., our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, our Redeemable Preferred Stock and our Series 2 Redeemable Preferred Stock) and our L Bond offerings are the principal means by which we intend to raise funds needed to meet our goal of growing a larger and more statistically diverse portfolio likely to meet our cash flow projections. While we plan to continue financing our business, if we are unable to continue to do so for any reason we may be unable to meet our goal. In addition, if actual cash flows from our portfolio of life insurance policies do not occur as our actuarial projections have forecasted, we could be forced to sell our investments in life insurance policies in order to service or satisfy our debt-related obligations. If we are forced to sell investments in life insurance policies or our entire portfolio, we may be unable to sell them at prices we believe are optimal, and may not be able to sell them at prices that approximate the discount rate we have applied to value our portfolio, particularly if our sale of policies occurs at a time when we are (or are perceived to be) in distress. In any such event, our business and the value of our securities, including preferred shares, may be materially and adversely impacted.\nAccuracy of the life expectancy estimates and mortality curves we use for small face policies could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we owned 359 \u201csmall face\u201d life insurance policies (i.e., a policy with $1 million in face value benefits or less) having $193 million in face value of insurance benefits. The underwriting processes and mortality curves we use to evaluate, price and purchase small face policies are different from, and may not be as reliable as, the processes we use for life insurance policies with larger face values of benefits. In particular, the processes used to develop these life expectancy reports are less extensive than traditional methods. Although we have professional actuarial guidance in the use and application of mortality curves to price and value small face policies, the application of these mortality curves may not be as reliable as or more subject to adjustment than the processes we use for larger face value of benefits. As the face value of our small face policies increases relative to the size of our total portfolio, the accuracy with which we have estimated life expectancies and mortality curves for these policies will become increasingly material to our business. Any shortcomings in the processes we have used to evaluate, price, purchase and value the small face policies we own could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. Any such outcomes would likely have a negative and possibly material effect on the price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debts.\nWe depend upon cash distributions from our subsidiaries, and contractual restrictions on distributions to us or adverse events at one of our operating subsidiaries could materially and adversely affect our ability to pay our debts and to continue to operate our business.\nGWG Holdings is a holding company. As a holding company, we conduct our operations through operating subsidiaries, and as such our most significant assets are cash and our ownership interests in our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to meet our obligations, including our debt-related and dividend-payment obligations, materially depends upon the ability of our subsidiaries to make cash distributions to us. In this regard, the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us is, and will continue to be, restricted by certain negative covenants in the agreement governing our revolving senior credit facilities.\nIf any of these contractual limitations were to materially impede the flow of cash to us, such circumstance would materially and adversely affect our ability to service and repay our debt, including obligations under the L Bonds and Series I Secured Notes, and make cash dividend payments to holders of our preferred stock offerings.\nIf a significant number of holders of our Series I Secured Notes and L Bonds demand repayment of those instruments upon maturity instead of renewing them, and at such time we do not have sufficient capital on hand to fund those repayments (and do not otherwise have access to sufficient capital), we may be forced to liquidate some of our life insurance policy assets, which could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $387.1 million in principal amount of L Bonds outstanding, and approximately $16.6 million in principal amount of Series I Secured Notes outstanding. By virtue of GWG Life\u2019s full and unconditional guarantee of obligations under the L Bonds, and other agreements contained in or made in connection with the indenture, the L Bonds are pari passu in right of payment and collateral with the Series I Secured Notes. The indenture governing the L Bonds, and the note issuance and security agreement governing the Series I Secured Notes, each provide for cross defaults upon an event of default under the provisions of the other agreement (i.e., an event of default under the note issuance and security agreement will constitute an event of default under the indenture for the L Bonds, and vice versa).\nSince we first issued our Series I Secured Notes, we have experienced $166.3 million in maturities, of which $125.0 million has renewed for an additional term, as of December 31, 2016. This has provided us with an historical renewal rate of approximately 75% for investments in our Series I Secured Notes. Since we first issued our L Bonds, we have experienced $282.1 million in maturities, of which $181.5 million has renewed for an additional term, as of December 31, 2016. This has provided us with an historical renewal rate of approximately 64% for investments in our L Bonds. Future contractual maturities of Series I Secured Notes and L Bonds as of December 31, 2016 are as follows:\nIf investors holding existing indebtedness which matures do not elect to renew their investments and we do not at such time have or have access to sufficient capital, then we may need to liquidate some of our investments in life insurance policies earlier than anticipated. In such an event, we may be unable to sell those policies at prices we believe are fair or otherwise appropriate and such sales could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. See also \u201cWe may not be able to raise the capital that we are seeking . . . .\u201d\nBecause we intend to hold our life insurance policies to their maturity, we therefore measure our debt coverage ratio against the interest cost of our debt obligations, which may not reflect the sale price of our life insurance policies if we were to liquidate them.\nWe intend to hold our life insurance policy investments until they are paid out at the mortality of the insured. As a result, we measure our debt coverage ratio based on the portfolio\u2019s gross expected yield against the interest cost of our total debt obligations to finance the portfolio. The debt coverage ratio, expressed as a percentage, is defined as the ratio of (i) total amounts outstanding on interest-bearing debt, over (ii) the net present asset value of all life insurance assets we own, plus any cash held in our accounts. For this purpose, the net present asset value of our life insurance assets is calculated as the present value of the life insurance portfolio\u2019s expected future cash flows discounted at the weighted-average interest rate of the interest bearing indebtedness for the previous month. Under the indenture governing the L Bonds, the maximum amount of such securities we may issue at any time is limited to an amount such that our debt coverage ratio does not exceed 90%. This limitation is designed to provide some comfort to our L Bond holders that the value of our assets exceeds our obligations to those holders. Nevertheless, the debt coverage ratio (as calculated) is not based on the fair value of our life insurance policies, which may be different - greater or less - than the amount we would receive if we were forced to sell those assets in the marketplace. Furthermore, mere compliance with the debt coverage ratio does not account for the significant transactional costs that could be associated with a sale of all or any significant portion of our portfolio.\nOur controlling stockholders and principal executives are involved in litigation \u201cclawback\u201d claims, and it is possible that adverse outcomes from these claims could negatively affect us.\nOur Chief Executive Officer, Jon R. Sabes, and our corporate secretary and Executive Vice President of Originations and Servicing, Steven F. Sabes, who together beneficially own or control approximately 70% of our common stock, are subject to litigation relating to claims by a bankruptcy trustee for loan payments made to an affiliate, Opportunity Finance, LLC. The litigation stems from the 2010 conviction of an individual operating a fraudulent business, which business filed for bankruptcy in 2008. The bankruptcy trustee alleges that loan repayments to Opportunity Finance were avoidable transfers under preference or other legal theories and seeks to recover amounts for other creditors of the bankruptcy estate. Case No. 08-45257 (U.S. Bankruptcy Court District of Minnesota). Such payments may ultimately be deemed to be avoidable transfers under preference or other legal theories. In addition, GWG Holdings invested $1.0 million in Opportunity Finance, LLC in 2006 and was repaid and received $176,948 of interest income from that investment in 2007. To date no claim has been made against GWG.\nWhile we believe there are numerous meritorious defenses to the claims made by the bankruptcy trustee and others, and we are advised that the defendants in that action will vigorously defend against the trustee\u2019s claims, such defendants may not prevail. If the bankruptcy trustee were to succeed in any effort to sell or transfer the equity interests of Jon R. Sabes or Steven F. Sabes in our company as a result of the litigation, there could be a change in control of our company, and our company and business could be materially and adversely impacted. Such adverse results would likely arise a breach of negative change-in-control covenants contained in our senior credit facility agreements. In addition, such an event would adversely affect holders of our L Bonds by reducing the number of shares of common stock of GWG Holdings that have been pledged as collateral security for our obligations under those securities. Finally, regardless of the outcome of this litigation, these matters may distract management and reduce the time and attention that they are able to devote to our business.\nThe loss of the services of our current executives or other key employees, or the failure to attract additional key individuals, would materially adversely affect our business operations and prospects.\nOur financial success is significantly dependent upon the efforts of our current executive officers and other key employees. In addition, our senior credit facility with Autobahn/DZ Bank requires Messrs. Jon R. Sabes and Steven F. Sabes to generally remain active within the business. We have entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Jon R. Sabes, Steven F. Sabes, William B. Acheson, Michael D. Freedman and Jon L. Gangelhoff. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that these individuals will continue to provide services to us. A voluntary or involuntary termination of employment could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations if we were not able to attract qualified replacements in a timely manner. At present, we do not maintain key-man life insurance policies for any of these individuals. In addition, our success and viability is also dependent to a significant extent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all areas of our business, especially our sales, policy acquisition, and financial management team. If we were to lose the members of these service teams, we would need to replace them with qualified individuals in a timely manner or our business operations and prospects could be adversely impacted.\nBeing a public company is expensive and could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors.\nWe have been a public reporting company since January 31, 2012. As such, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These requirements generate significant accounting, legal, and financial compliance costs, and make some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly than they would otherwise be, and may place significant strain on our personnel and resources. These rules and regulations applicable to public companies, and the risks involved in serving as an officer or director of a public company, may also make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under federal securities laws, and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements normally applicable to public companies, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation, and delayed adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards. We could be an emerging growth company through 2019, although certain circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier. It is possible that investors will find our common stock less attractive due to our use of these reduced reporting requirements. If some investors do in fact find our common stock less attractive, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe have a merchant cash advance business that presents a number of unique risks.\nIn February 2016, we acquired certain loan and advance assets from a lender to merchant cash advance funders. A merchant cash advance funder provides small businesses with one or more cash advances structured as the purchase of a portion of a small business\u2019s future receipts. This type of transaction is not characterized or structured as a loan. Small businesses typically seek these advances for working capital purposes to finance their purchase of inventory, equipment, or to otherwise address immediate business needs.\nOur activities in this space are currently not significant to our Company as a whole. Nevertheless, this business presents a number of unique risks, including the illiquidity of the cash advance loans and advances; our critical reliance on certain individuals to operate the business; collection issues and challenges given that the merchant cash advances are typically unsecured; and sensitivity to general economic conditions.", "PERMNO": 14930, "SIC": 6799, "TIC": "GWGH"}
