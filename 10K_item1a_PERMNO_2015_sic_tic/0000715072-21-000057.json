RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. The risks disclosed below, either alone or in combination, could materially adversely affect the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to arrest the virus\u2019s spread have adversely affected, and are expected to continue to adversely affect, the Company.\nThe spread of the COVID-19 virus has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States and globally. In an effort to prevent the further spread of the virus, federal and state governments, including state and local governments in the markets in which we operate, have imposed various levels of restrictions on all businesses and the activities of individuals outside their residences, ranging from the required closure of \u201cnon-essential\u201d businesses at the onset of the pandemic and restrictions on the number of customers that a business may allow inside its premises to orders mandating that all individuals wear protective face coverings and observe social distancing in all instances. In addition, most businesses, including the Company, have taken steps to protect the health and well-being of their customers and employees and to promote efforts to limit the transmission of the disease, and these steps, to varying degrees, have limited the normal operations of these businesses. These actions (including those that remain in place and those that have lapsed as of the date hereof) by federal and state governments, businesses and individuals have had, and continue to have, a severe negative impact on the global and United States economies as well as the local economies across our footprint. The United States economy and the Company's markets in particular continue to experience depressed commercial and consumer activity and changes in the manner of conducting permitted activities, elevated levels of unemployment, disrupted U.S. and global supply chains, increased volatility as well as other disruptions in the financial markets and credit deterioration in many industries. The ongoing impact of the pandemic may in turn have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, asset quality, capital, cash flows and prospects. Furthermore, additional measures taken in the future to address the pandemic by government, businesses in general and the Company may exacerbate the economic impact of the pandemic on us, especially if the current level of restrictions on business activity fails to arrest the ongoing spread of the COVID-19 virus and stimulus payments provided to individuals by the federal government do not have the intended impact on the United States economy.\nFederal and state governments have taken unprecedented actions to assist businesses and individuals impacted by the COVID-19 virus and to stabilize the financial markets and otherwise limit the impact of the pandemic on the economy as a whole, and additional legislation and other actions are likely to continue to be contemplated until the pandemic is over. The Company has implemented measures to assist its qualified commercial and consumer clients by allowing deferrals on principal and interest payments on loans. It is unclear at this time how successful, if at all, these past, present and future governmental actions as well as the Company\u2019s own efforts will be in supporting businesses and individuals, the markets and the broader economy over the long term and generally ameliorating the impact of the COVID-19 virus on the United States as a whole and the particular markets in which we operate. In the meantime, these governmental actions, along with the steps the Company has taken, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, asset quality, capital, cash flows and prospects. In addition, the Company faces an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the pandemic on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions.\nThe extent to which the pandemic impacts our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, asset quality, capital, cash flows and prospects ultimately depends on the duration of the pandemic, the pace at which the vaccines being deployed to prevent the spread of the pandemic can be distributed and administered in our markets, and the effectiveness of the measures implemented and to be implemented by governments and businesses, including the Company, to address the pandemic and the time it will take the global, national and local economies to recover to their pre-pandemic levels, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. Further, there can be no assurance that any of these efforts will be effective. In the meantime, until the effects of the pandemic subside, we expect continued draws on lines of credit, reduced revenues in our business, and increased customer defaults. As described above in the \u201cRisk Management\u201d section in Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Form 10-K, the Company significantly increased its allowance for credit losses in 2020, and the impact of the pandemic may result in further increases to our allowance for credit losses. Even after the pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, asset quality, capital, cash flows and prospects, which could be material, as a result of the economic impact and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nThe COVID-19 virus has also resulted in heightened operational risks. A significant portion of our workforce is currently working remotely, and increased levels of remote access create additional cybersecurity risk and opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals may increase their attempts to compromise business emails, including an increase in phishing attempts, and fraudulent vendors or other parties may view the pandemic as an opportunity to prey upon\nconsumers and businesses during this time. This could result in increased fraud losses to us or our customers. The increase in online and remote banking activities may also increase the risk of fraud in certain instances. In addition, state and local orders and regulations limiting the conduct of in-person business operations may impact our ability to operate at normal levels and to restore operations to their pre-pandemic level for an unknown period of time. Separately, our third-party service providers have also been impacted by the pandemic, and we have experienced some disruption to certain services performed by vendors. To date, these disruptions have not been material and we have developed solutions to work around these disruptions, but we may experience additional disruption in the future, which could adversely impact our business.\nWe are subject to lending risk.\nThere are inherent risks associated with our lending activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where we operate as well as those across the United States. Increases in interest rates on loans and/or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 69.57% of our loan portfolio consisted of C&I, construction and commercial real estate loans, excluding loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d). These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk to our financial condition than other types of loans due primarily to the large amounts loaned to individual borrowers. Because the loan portfolio contains a significant number of C&I, construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for credit losses and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur C&I, construction and commercial real estate loan portfolios are discussed in more detail under the heading \u201cOperations - Operations of Community Banks\u201d in Item 1, Business, in this report.\nOur allowance for credit losses may be insufficient, and we may be required to further increase our provision for credit losses.\nAlthough we try to maintain diversification within our loan portfolio in order to minimize the effect of economic conditions within a particular industry, management also maintains an allowance for credit losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses on loans charged to expense, to absorb credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio. The credit loss estimation process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio segments. Credit quality is assessed and monitored by evaluating various attributes, and the results of those evaluations are utilized in underwriting new loans and in the Company\u2019s process for the estimation of expected credit losses. Credit quality monitoring procedures and indicators can include an assessment of problem loans, the types of loans, historical loss experience, new lending products, emerging credit trends, changes in the size and character of loan categories and other factors, including the Company\u2019s risk rating system, regulatory guidance and economic conditions, such as the unemployment rate and GDP growth in the markets in which the Company operates, as well as trends in the market values of underlying collateral securing loans, all as determined based on input from management, loan review staff and other sources. This evaluation is complex and inherently subjective, as it requires estimates by management that are inherently uncertain and therefore susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. In future periods, evaluations of the overall loan portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and provision for credit losses in those future periods.\nThe 2008-2009 recession, and then subsequently the COVID-19 pandemic, in the United States highlighted the inherent difficulty in estimating with precision the extent to which credit risks and future trends need to be addressed through a provision to our allowance for credit losses. Any deterioration of current and future economic conditions could cause us to experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses. As a result, we may be required to make further increases in our provision for credit losses and to charge off additional loans in the future, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for credit losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for credit losses. Any increases in the allowance for credit losses will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A discussion of the policies and procedures related to management\u2019s process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses is set forth under the headings \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d and \u201cRisk Management - Credit Risk and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Unfunded Commitments\u201d in Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this report.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on assets, such as loans and securities, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve decreased the federal funds target rate by 150 basis points in March 2020. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (1) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, which could reduce the amount of fee income generated, and (2) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities.\nOur financial results are constantly exposed to market risk.\nMarket risk refers to the probability of variations in net interest income or the fair value of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates, among other things. The primary source of market risk to us is the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. We are subject to market risk because of the following factors:\n- Assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times. For example, if assets reprice more slowly than liabilities and interest rates are generally rising, earnings may initially decline.\n- Assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts. For example, when interest rates are generally rising, we may increase rates charged on loans by an amount that is less than the general increase in market interest rates because of intense pricing competition, while similarly intense pricing competition for deposits dictates that we raise our deposit rates in line with the general increase in market rates. Also, risk occurs when assets and liabilities have similar repricing frequencies but are tied to different market interest rate indices that may not move in tandem.\n- Short-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts, i.e., the shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields and funding costs differently.\n- The remaining maturity of various assets and liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if long-term mortgage interest rates decline sharply, mortgage backed securities held in our securities portfolio may prepay significantly earlier than anticipated, which could reduce portfolio income. If prepayment rates increase, we would be required to amortize net premiums into income over a shorter period of time, thereby reducing the corresponding asset yield and net interest income.\n- Interest rates may have an indirect impact on loan demand, credit losses, loan origination volume, the value of financial assets and financial liabilities, gains and losses on sales of securities and loans, the value of mortgage servicing rights and other sources of earnings.\nAlthough management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce market risk on the results of our operations, these strategies are based on assumptions that may be incorrect. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nVolatility in interest rates may also result in disintermediation, which is the flow of funds away from financial institutions into direct investments, such as U.S. Government and Agency securities and other investment vehicles, including mutual funds, which generally pay higher rates of return than financial institutions because of the absence of federal insurance premiums and reserve requirements. Disintermediation could also result in material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA discussion of our policies and procedures used to identify, assess and manage certain interest rate risk is set forth under the heading \u201cRisk Management - Interest Rate Risk\u201d in Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in this report.\nThe planned phasing out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a financial benchmark may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nThe planned phasing out of LIBOR as a financial benchmark presents risks to the financial instruments originated or held by the Company. LIBOR is the reference rate used for many of our transactions, including a substantial portion of our variable rate loans as well as our borrowing and purchase and sale of securities; in addition, the derivatives that we use to manage risk related to the foregoing transactions are tied to LIBOR. However, a reduced volume of interbank unsecured term borrowing coupled with recent legal and regulatory proceedings related to rate manipulation by certain financial institutions has led to international reconsideration of LIBOR as a financial benchmark. The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates the process for establishing LIBOR, announced in July 2017 that the sustainability of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed. Accordingly, the FCA intends to stop persuading, or compelling, banks to submit to LIBOR after 2021. Until such\ntime, however, FCA panel banks have agreed to continue to support LIBOR.\nIt is not clear at this time how LIBOR will be determined for purposes of financial instruments that are currently referencing LIBOR if and when it ceases to exist. If LIBOR is discontinued after 2021 as expected, there may be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments. Such discontinuation may cause us to incur significant expense in amending these governing instruments and otherwise effecting the transition to a new reference rate. Discontinuation also may increase operational and other risks to the Company and the industry.\nWhile there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, or ARRC, selected the Secured Overnight Finance Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as an alternative to LIBOR. SOFR has been published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (\u201cFRBNY\u201d) since May 2018, and it is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR and organizations are currently considering industry wide and company-specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR.\nAlthough the floating interest rate component of the Company\u2019s 4.50% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2035 are linked to SOFR, the Company has not yet decided if it will adopt SOFR or another rate as the reference rate for its lending or borrowing transactions, and there can be no assurances that, regardless of the Company\u2019s decision, SOFR will be widely adopted as the replacement reference rate for LIBOR. In addition, because SOFR is published by the FRBNY based on data received from other sources, we have no control over its determination, calculation or publication. Finally, there can be no assurance that SOFR will not be discontinued or fundamentally altered in a manner that is materially adverse to the parties that utilize SOFR as the reference rate for transactions.\nThe market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, including SOFR, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could:\n- adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, and the revenue and expenses associated with, our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR's role in determining market interest rates globally;\n- adversely affect the value of our floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements;\n- result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based notes, securities and other instruments; and\n- require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark.\nFinally, the implementation of LIBOR reform proposals may result in increased compliance costs and operational costs, including costs related to continued participation in LIBOR and the transition to a replacement reference rate or rates. We cannot reasonably estimate the expected cost.\nLiquidity needs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nMaintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the operation of our business. We need sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, deposit maturities and withdrawals and other cash commitments arising in both the ordinary course of business and in other unpredictable circumstances. We rely on dividends from the Bank as our primary source of funds. The primary source of the Bank\u2019s funds are customer deposits, loan repayments, proceeds from our investment securities and borrowings. While scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, they are subject to the ability of borrowers to repay the loans. The ability of borrowers to repay loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups, reductions in real estate values or markets, business closings or lay-offs, pandemics, inclement weather, natural disasters and international instability. Additionally, deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, returns available to customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions. Accordingly, we may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations or to support growth. Such sources include Federal Home Loan Bank advances and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks.\nIf the aforementioned sources of liquidity are not adequate for our needs, we may attempt to raise additional capital in the equity or debt markets. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in such markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance.\nIf we are unable to meet our liquidity needs through any of the aforementioned sources, whether at all or at the time or the cost that we anticipate, we may be required to slow or discontinue loan growth, capital expenditures or other investments or liquidate assets.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information furnished by others about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, we often rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports, other financial information and appraisals of the value of collateral. We may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports, other financial information or appraisals could have a material adverse effect on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition in our industry is intense and may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and have substantially greater resources than we have, including higher total assets and capitalization, greater access to capital markets and a broader offering of financial services. Such competitors primarily include national, regional and community banks within the various markets in which we operate. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies, FinTech companies and other financial intermediaries. The information under the heading \u201cCompetition\u201d in Item 1, Business, in this report provides more information regarding the competitive conditions in our growth markets.\nOur industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes. We also expect continued consolidation in the banking industry as a result of, among other things, elevated regulatory compliance costs, the benefits of larger scale when making investments in new technology and changes in laws affecting larger financial institutions. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, legislative and regulatory changes on both the federal and state level may materially affect competitive conditions in our industry. Finally, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as loans and automatic transfer and payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n- the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe and sound assets;\n- the ability to expand our market position;\n- the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n- the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n- customer satisfaction with our level of service; and\n- industry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions and other third parties.\nEntities within the financial services industry are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and from time to time execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral we hold cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit due to us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation, and such regulation could limit or restrict our activities and adversely affect our earnings.\nWe and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, while consumer protection statutes are primarily focused on the protection of the users of our lending and deposit services. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. In addition, significant changes to such regulations have been proposed or may be proposed. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of the foregoing, could affect us and/or the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things.\nUnder regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements, we and the Bank must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. Our failure to maintain the status of \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under our regulatory framework could affect the confidence of our customers in us, thus compromising our competitive position. In addition, failure to maintain the status of \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under our regulatory framework, \u201cwell managed\u201d under regulatory examination procedures or \u201csatisfactory\u201d under the CRA could compromise our status as a bank holding company and related eligibility for a streamlined review process for merger or acquisition proposals and would result in higher deposit insurance premiums assessed by the FDIC.\nWe are also subject to various privacy, data protection and information security laws. Under the GLB Act, we are subject to limitations on our ability to share our customers\u2019 nonpublic personal information with unaffiliated parties, and we are required to provide certain disclosures to our customers about our data collection and security practices. Customers have the right to opt out of our disclosure of their personal financial information to unaffiliated parties. We are also subject to state laws regulating the privacy of individual's private information, many of which are more restrictive, and have more severe sanctions for noncompliance, than the GLB Act. Finally, the GLB Act requires us to develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing appropriate safeguards for our customers\u2019 nonpublic personal information. New laws and regulations have also been proposed that could increase our privacy, data protection and information security compliance costs. Our failure to comply with new or existing privacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations could result in regulatory or governmental investigations and/or fines, sanctions and other expenses which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a public company, we are also subject to laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act and SEC regulations. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, amendment or outright repeal. As a result, the amendment or repeal of any such laws, regulations or standards, or the issuance of new guidance for complying therewith by regulatory and governing bodies, could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased expenses and a diversion of management time and attention.\nFailure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could also result in sanctions by regulatory agencies and/or civil money penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, such violations nevertheless may occur. The information under the heading \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in Item 1, Business, and Note 22, \u201cRegulatory Matters,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this report provides more information regarding the regulatory environment in which we and the Bank operate.\nHigher FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely affect our financial condition.\nIn order to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund following the recession in 2008-2009, the FDIC significantly increased the assessment rates paid by financial institutions for deposit insurance. In November 2018, the DIF reached the minimum reserve ratio of 1.35% required under the Dodd-Frank Act, which resulted in the discontinuance of the assessment surcharges that had been charged to banks with greater than $10 billion in assets like the Bank. However, under the Dodd-Frank Act, if the reserve ratio falls or is projected within 6 months to fall below 1.35%, or if the FDIC increases reserves against future losses, the increased assessments are to be borne primarily by institutions with assets greater than $10 billion, which will apply to the Bank. Any increases in FDIC insurance premiums and any special assessments may adversely affect our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by FASB or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), which are periodically revised and/or expanded. From time to time, FASB or other accounting standard setting bodies adopt new accounting standards or amend existing standards. In addition, market conditions often prompt these bodies to promulgate new guidance that further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to financial instruments, structures or transactions as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures. Our estimate of the impact of accounting developments that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual reports on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, but the impact of these changes often is difficult to precisely assess. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results, or a cumulative charge to retained earnings. It is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although management has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before the loan is recorded and before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business may be adversely affected by current economic conditions in general and specifically in the markets in which we operate.\nGeneral business and economic conditions in the United States and abroad can materially affect our business and operations and the businesses and operations of our customers. A weak U.S. economy is likely to cause uncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process, the medium and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government and future tax rates. In addition, economic and other conditions in foreign countries could affect the stability of global financial markets and adversely impact global supply chains, which could hinder U.S. economic growth. Future developments (including the extent of the virus\u2019s spread and the measures, such as vaccines, quarantines and travel restrictions, taken to contain such spread), may adversely affect economic conditions in the United States generally and our markets in particular.\nWeak economic conditions are characterized by deflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, a lack of liquidity and/or depressed prices in the secondary market for mortgage loans, increased delinquencies on mortgage, consumer and C&I loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity. All of these factors are detrimental to our business, and the interplay between these factors can be complex and unpredictable. Our business is also significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the U.S. federal government and its agencies. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control. Adverse economic conditions and government policy responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on the businesses and operations of our customers and in turn on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nMore particularly, much of our business development and marketing strategy is directed toward fulfilling the banking and financial services needs of small to medium size businesses. Such businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively impact the markets in which we operate and these businesses are adversely affected, our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nWe have a high concentration of loans secured by real estate.\nAt December 31, 2020, approximately 82.73% of our loan portfolio (excluding loans under the Paycheck Protection Program) had real estate as a primary or secondary component of the collateral securing the loan. The real estate provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of a default by the borrower. Real estate values have generally recovered since the most recent recession, but any adverse change in our markets could significantly impair the value of the particular collateral securing our loans and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure for an amount necessary to satisfy the borrower\u2019s obligations to us. Furthermore, in a declining real estate market, we often will need to further increase our allowance for credit losses to address the deterioration in the value of the real estate securing our loans. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a concentration of credit exposure in commercial real estate.\nIn addition to the general risks associated with our lending activities described above, including the effects of declines in real estate values, commercial real estate (\u201cCRE\u201d) loans are subject to additional risks. These loans depend on cash flows from the property to service the debt. Cash flows, either in the form of rental income or the proceeds from sales of commercial real estate, may be affected significantly by general economic conditions. A general downturn in the local economy where the property is located, or a decline in occupancy rates in particular, could increase the likelihood of default. An increase in defaults in our CRE loan portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $5.4 billion in commercial real estate loans, representing approximately 49.51% of our loans outstanding on that date, as follows:\nAs discussed under the heading \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in Item 1, Business, above, the federal banking agencies promulgated guidance regarding when an institution will be deemed to potentially have significant CRE concentration risk exposure, as indicated by the results of the 100/300 Test. Although the 100/300 Test is not a limit on our lending activity, if any future results of a 100/300 Test evaluation show us to have a potential CRE concentration risk, we may elect, or be required by our regulators, to adopt additional risk management practices or other limits on our activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure or breach of our operational or security systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation and create significant financial and legal exposure for us.\nAs a financial institution, we rely heavily on our ability, and the ability of our third party service providers, to securely and reliably process, record, transmit and monitor confidential and other information through our and our third party service provider\u2019s computer systems and networks. Our operational systems, including, among other things, deposit and loan servicing, online and mobile banking, wealth management, accounting and data processing, could be materially adversely impacted by a failure, interruption or breach in the security or integrity of any of these systems, whether our own or one of our third party service provider\u2019s. Threats to these systems come from a variety of sources, including computer hacking involving the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks, identity theft, electronic fraudulent activity and attempted theft of financial assets. These threats are very sophisticated and constantly evolving. In addition, our systems are threatened by unpredictable events such as power outages or tornadoes or other natural disasters.\nWe have invested a significant amount of time and expense, in security infrastructure investments and the development of policies and procedures governing our operations as well as employee training and monitoring of our third party service providers, in our efforts to preserve the security and integrity of our systems from the aforementioned threats. Despite these efforts, we can provide no assurances that our systems, or our provider\u2019s systems, will not experience any failures, interruptions or security breaches or that, if any such failures, interruptions or breaches occur, they will be addressed in a timely and adequate manner. If the security and integrity of our systems, or the systems of one of our providers, are compromised, our operations could be significantly disrupted and our or our customer\u2019s confidential information could be misappropriated, among other\nthings. This in turn could result in financial losses to us or our customers, lasting damage to our reputation, the violation of privacy or other laws and significant litigation risk, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us.\nWe are subject to numerous risks, including lending risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, market risk, information security risk and model risk, among other risks encountered in the ordinary course of our operations. We have put in place processes and procedures designed to identify, measure, monitor and mitigate these risks. However, all risk management frameworks are inherently limited, for a number of reasons. First, we may not have identified all material risks affecting our operations. Next, our current procedures may not anticipate future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Also, we may have underestimated the impact of known risks or overestimated the effectiveness of the policies and procedures we have implemented to mitigate these risks. The recent recession and the heightened regulatory scrutiny of financial institutions that resulted therefrom, coupled with increases in the scope and complexity of our operations, among other things, have increased the level of risk that we must manage. Accordingly, we could suffer losses as a result of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.\nOur business strategy includes the continuation of growth plans, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nHistorically, we have grown our business through the acquisition of entire financial institutions and through de novo branching and we intend to continue pursuing this growth strategy for the foreseeable future. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies when expanding their franchise, including the following:\nManagement of Growth. We may be unable to successfully:\n- maintain loan quality in the context of significant loan growth;\n- maintain adequate management personnel and systems to oversee such growth;\n- maintain adequate internal audit, loan review and compliance functions; and\n- implement additional policies, procedures and operating systems required to support such growth.\nOperating Results. Existing offices or future offices may not maintain or achieve deposit levels, loan balances or other operating results necessary to avoid losses or produce profits. Our growth strategy necessarily entails growth in overhead expenses as we routinely add new offices and staff. Our historical results may not be indicative of future results or results that may be achieved if we increase the number and concentration of our branch offices. Should any new location be unprofitable or marginally profitable, or should any existing location experience a decline in profitability or incur losses, the adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition could be more significant than would be the case for a larger company.\nExpansion into New Markets. Much of our recent growth has been focused in the highly-competitive metropolitan areas of Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee, Birmingham and Huntsville, Alabama, Atlanta, Georgia, east Tennessee, as well as Gainesville and Ocala, Florida. In these growth markets we face competition from a wide array of financial institutions, including much larger, well-established financial institutions.\nRegulatory and Economic Factors. Our growth and expansion plans may be adversely affected by a number of regulatory and economic developments or other events. Failure to obtain required regulatory approvals, changes in laws and regulations or other regulatory developments and changes in prevailing economic conditions or other unanticipated events may prevent or adversely affect our continued growth and expansion. Such factors may cause us to alter our growth and expansion plans or slow or halt the growth and expansion process, which may prevent us from entering certain target markets or allow competitors to gain or retain market share in our existing or expected markets.\nFailure to successfully address these issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Also, if our growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions.\nThe success of our acquisitions will depend on, among other things, our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and to integrate the acquired assets and operations in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt our existing customer relationships or result in decreased revenues resulting from any loss of customers. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take\nlonger to realize than expected. Additionally, we will make fair value estimates of certain assets and liabilities in recording each acquisition. Actual values of these assets and liabilities could differ from our estimates, which could result in our not achieving the anticipated benefits of the particular acquisition.\nWe cannot assure investors that our acquisitions will have positive results, including results relating to: correctly assessing the asset quality of the assets acquired; the total cost of integration, including management attention and resources; the time required to complete the integration successfully; the amount of longer-term cost savings; being able to profitably deploy funds acquired in the transaction; retaining the existing client relationships; or the overall performance of the combined business.\nOur future growth and profitability depends, in part, on our ability to successfully manage the combined operations. Integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly, and we may encounter a number of difficulties, such as:\n- deposit attrition, customer loss and revenue loss;\n- the loss of key employees;\n- the disruption of our operations and business;\n- our inability to maintain and increase competitive presence;\n- possible inconsistencies in standards, control procedures and policies; and/or\n- unexpected problems with costs, operations, personnel, technology and credit.\nAdditionally, general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit our successful integration of the operations acquired.\nWe may continue to experience increased credit costs or need to take additional markdowns and make additional provisions to the allowance for credit losses on loans. Any of these actions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future. In addition, the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business may divert management\u2019s attention from other important issues and could harm our business.\nWe may face risks with respect to future acquisitions.\nWhen we attempt to expand our business through mergers and acquisitions (including FDIC-assisted transactions), we seek targets that are culturally similar to us, have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through economies of scale or expanded services or, in the case of FDIC-assisted transactions, on account of the loss share arrangements with the FDIC associated with such transactions. In addition to the general risks associated with our growth plans and the particular risks associated with FDIC-assisted transactions, both of which are highlighted above, in general acquiring other banks, businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n- the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisition and merger targets;\n- inaccuracies in the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution;\n- the time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management and opening new bank locations, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n- our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders;\n- the diversion of our management\u2019s attention to the negotiation of a transaction;\n- the incurrence of an impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and adverse effects on our results of operations;\n- entry into new markets where we lack experience; and\n- risks associated with integrating the operations and personnel of acquired businesses.\nWe expect to continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities (including FDIC-assisted transactions) that are presented to us and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur at any time. Historically, acquisitions of non-failed financial institutions involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Associated With Our Common Stock\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends is limited by law, and we may be unable to pay future dividends.\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank, and we receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from the Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock and interest and principal on our debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to us. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service our debt, pay our obligations or pay dividends on our common stock. The inability to receive dividends from the Bank could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The information under Note 21, \u201cRestrictions on Cash, Securities, Bank Dividends, Loans or Advances,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this report provides a detailed discussion about the restrictions governing the Bank\u2019s ability to transfer funds to us.\nOur stock price can be volatile.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for an investor to resell our common stock when desired and at attractive prices. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n- actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations;\n- recommendations by securities analysts;\n- operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n- news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the banking and financial services industry;\n- perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n- new technology used, or services offered, by us or our competitors;\n- significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n- failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n- changes in government regulations; and\n- civil unrest and geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, pandemics, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nThe trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other bank holding companies.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, the average daily trading volume in our common stock is generally less than that of many of our competitors and other bank holding companies that are publicly-traded companies. For the 60 days ended February 19, 2021, the average daily trading volume for Renasant common stock was 333,240 shares per day. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause volatility in the price of our common stock.\nHolders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our common shareholders.\nWe have supported a portion of our growth through the issuance of trust preferred securities from special purpose trusts and accompanying junior subordinated debentures. Also, in connection with our acquisitions of other financial institutions, we have assumed junior subordinated debentures. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities of these trusts are conditionally guaranteed by us. Further, the junior subordinated debentures we issued to the trusts are senior to our shares of common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on our common stock (such dividend restrictions do not apply to the subordinated notes issued in August 2016 and September 2020 or assumed in connection with the Metropolitan acquisition). We have the right to defer distributions on our junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time no dividends may be paid on our common stock.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit.\nOur common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, an investor may lose some or all of its investment in our common stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as certain banking laws, could decrease our chances of being acquired even if our acquisition is in our shareholders\u2019 best interests.\nProvisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders. The combination of these provisions impedes a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of our common stock and discourage a takeover.\nOur shareholders authorized the Board of Directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock without any further action on the part of our shareholders. Our Board of Directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. In the event that we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. In addition, the ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of our shareholders may impede a takeover of us and prevent a transaction perceived to be favorable to our shareholders.\nShares eligible for future sale could have a dilutive effect.\nShares of our common stock eligible for future sale, including those that may be issued in any other private or public offering of our common stock for cash or as incentives under equity incentive plans, could have a dilutive effect on the market for our common stock and could adversely affect market prices. As of February 19, 2021, there were 150,000,000 shares of our common stock authorized, of which 56,238,556 shares were outstanding.", "PERMNO": 77526, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "RNST"}
