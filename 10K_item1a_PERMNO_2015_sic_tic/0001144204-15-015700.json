Risk Factors\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this report and in any documents incorporated in this report by reference.\nIf any of the following risks, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant, develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. If that happens, the market price of our common stock could decline, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have no approved products and currently are dependent on the success of our HBV and microbiome therapies.\nTo date, we have no approved product on the market and have generated no product revenues. Our prospects are substantially dependent on our ability to develop and commercialize our HBV and microbiome therapies. Unless and until we receive approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities for our product candidates, we cannot sell our product candidates and will not have product revenues. We will have to fund all of our operations and capital expenditures from cash on hand, any licensing fees and any future securities offerings or debt financings.\nIn addition, all of our product candidates are in an early stage of development and their risk of failure is high. The data supporting our drug discovery and development programs are derived from either laboratory and pre-clinical studies. We cannot predict when or if any one of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval. The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of our product candidates is limited, and many companies, some with more resources than us, are and may be developing competitive product candidates. For these and other reasons, our drug discovery and development may not be successful and we may not generate viable products or revenue.\nWe depend entirely on the success of our product candidates, our HBV and microbiome therapies, both of which are in pre-clinical development. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, either of our current or any of our other product candidates.\nOur HBV and microbiome therapies are our only current product candidates. Both are in pre-clinical development stages. Neither of our current product candidates has advanced into a pivotal study, and it may be years before such a study is initiated, if ever. The clinical trials of our product candidates are, and the manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates will be, subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States and in other countries where we intend to test and, if approved, market any product candidate. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate, we must successfully meet a number of critical developmental milestones, including:\n\u00b7 developing dosages that will be tolerated, safe and effective;\n\u00b7 demonstrating through clinical trials that the product candidate is safe and effective in patients for the intended indication;\n\u00b7 determining the appropriate delivery mechanism;\n\u00b7 demonstrating that the product candidate formulation will be stable for commercially reasonable time periods; and\n\u00b7 completing the development and scale-up to permit manufacture of our product candidates in commercial quantities and at acceptable prices.\nThe time necessary to achieve these developmental milestones for any individual product candidate is long and uncertain, and we may not successfully complete these milestones for our HBV and microbiome therapies or any other product candidates that we may develop. We have not yet completed and may never complete the development of any product. If we are unable to complete development of our HBV or microbiome therapies, or any other product candidates that we may develop, we will be unable to generate revenue or build a sustainable or profitable business\nWe have a limited operating history and a history of operating losses, and expect to incur significant additional operating losses.\nWe were established in October 2005, began active operations in the spring of 2007 and have only a limited operating history. In addition, we have terminated our programs related to our three prior product candidates. Therefore, there is limited historical financial information upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. Our prospects must be considered in light of the uncertainties, risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of operations. We, and Assembly Pharmaceuticals prior to our merger, have generated losses since we began operations and, as of December 31, 2014, the combined company had an accumulated deficit of $139.7 million. Net cash outflows after the Assembly Merger was approximately $7.5 million. We expect to incur substantial additional losses over the next several years as we continue to pursue our research, development, preclinical studies and clinical trial activities. The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain. We have no products that have generated any commercial revenue, do not expect to generate revenues from the commercial sale of products unless and until our HBV or microbiome therapies or any other product candidate is approved by the FDA for sale, and we might never generate revenues from the sale of products.\nWe are not currently profitable and might never become profitable.\nWe have a history of losses and expect to incur significant operating and capital expenditures and resultant substantial losses and negative operating cash flow for the next several years, and beyond if we do not successfully launch and commercialize our HBV therapy or our microbiome program. We might never achieve or maintain profitability. We anticipate that our expenses will continue to be substantial in the foreseeable future as we:\n\u00b7 continue to undertake research and development to identify potential product candidates;\n\u00b7 continue to undertake preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates; and\n\u00b7 seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates.\nAs a result, we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability will depend on, among other things:\n\u00b7 successful completion of research, preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 obtaining necessary regulatory approvals from the FDA and international regulatory agencies for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 establishing manufacturing, sales, and marketing arrangements with third parties for any approved products; and\n\u00b7 raising sufficient funds to finance our activities, if and when needed.\nWe might not succeed at any of these undertakings. If we are unsuccessful at some or all of these undertakings, our business, prospects, and results of operations might be materially adversely affected.\nPre-clinical testing and clinical trials involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nPreclinical studies and clinical testing are expensive, can take many years to complete and their outcome is highly uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the preclinical study and clinical trial processes due to inadequate performance of a drug candidate or inadequate adherence by patients or investigators to clinical trial protocols. In addition, the results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. For example, in late June 2012, we reported that our second Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of iferanserin in patients with hemorrhoidal disease did not meet its endpoints, despite favorable Phase II trial results. We also reported in February 2014 that our Phase III clinical trial for diltiazem for the treatment of anal fissures demonstrated no significant improvement compared to placebo despite favorable results in a prior Phase III trial. These same risks apply to our planned development of our current and any other product candidates.\nWe are an early stage company and might not be able to commercialize any product candidates.\nWe are an early stage company and have not demonstrated our ability to perform the functions necessary for the successful commercialization of any product candidates. The successful commercialization of any product candidates will require us to perform a variety of functions, including:\n\u00b7 continuing to undertake research and development and preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u00b7 participating in regulatory approval processes;\n\u00b7 formulating and manufacturing products; and\n\u00b7 conducting sales, marketing and distribution activities.\nOur development of our product candidates is subject to the risks of failure and delay inherent in the development of new pharmaceutical products and products based on new technologies, including:\n\u00b7 delays in product development, preclinical and clinical testing;\n\u00b7 unplanned expenditures in product development, preclinical and clinical testing;\n\u00b7 failure of a product candidate to demonstrate acceptable safety and efficacy;\n\u00b7 failure to receive regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 emergence of superior or equivalent products;\n\u00b7 inability to manufacture and sell on our own, or through any others, product candidates on a commercial scale or at a financially viable cost; and\n\u00b7 failure to achieve market acceptance.\nBecause of these risks, our research and development efforts might not result in any commercially viable products. If we do not successfully complete a significant portion of these development efforts, obtain required regulatory approvals, and have commercial success with any approved products, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially harmed.\nThere are substantial risks inherent in attempting to commercialize new drugs, and, as a result, we may not be able to successfully develop products for commercial use.\nOur HBV therapy research and development efforts involve therapeutics based on modulating forms of HBV core proteins with Core protein Allosteric Modulators, or CpAMs, which is a clinically unproven mechanism of action. The development of our CpAM technology is in the early stages, and the commercial feasibility and acceptance of our CpAM technology are unknown. Similarly, the technology for our microbiome therapy is in early stages of preclinical development.\nScientific research and development requires significant amounts of capital and takes a long time to reach commercial viability, if it can be achieved at all. To date, our research and development projects have not produced commercially viable drugs, and may never do so. During the research and development process, we may experience technological barriers that we may be unable to overcome. Further, certain underlying premises in our development programs are not fully proven. More specifically, the theory that CpAMs can selectively reduce viral antigens in HBV patients and result in a functional cure is unproven. Thus, even if CpAM technology is successful at reducing antigen levels in HBV patients, it may not be a commercially viable drug if there is not a corresponding medical benefit related to the underlying HBV infection. Similarly, the ability to effectively and reliably deliver bacteria to the GI tract is unproven, and, even if it can be proven, it may be difficult or impossible to provide the treatment economically. Because of these uncertainties, it is possible that no commercial products will be successfully developed. If we are unable to successfully develop commercial products, we will be unable to generate revenue or build a sustainable or profitable business.\nThe results of both ongoing and future studies and trials for any of our product candidates might not be predictive of the results in any future studies or trials.\nThe results of any earlier study or trial for any of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results for any future studies or trials. Further, the results of any study or trial for any of our product candidates may not be as positive as the results for any prior studies or trials, if at all. In addition, unforeseen safety issues could emerge in any future study or trial, which could severely hamper the likelihood of FDA or other regulatory approval of any product candidate. If any of these events were to occur, the development of any product candidate could be significantly delayed and more expensive than anticipated, and could lead us to abandon our development efforts entirely, any of which would have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nWe will need additional financing to complete the development of any product candidate and fund our activities in the future.\nWe anticipate that we will incur operating losses for the next several years as we continue to develop our HBV therapy and our microbiome program as well as initiate any development of any other product candidate and will require substantial funds during that time to support our operations. We expect that our current resources will provide us with sufficient capital to fund our operations into the second quarter of 2016. However, we might consume our available capital before that time if, for example, we are not efficient in managing our resources or if we encounter unforeseen costs, delays or other issues or if regulatory requirements change. If that happens, we may need additional financing to continue the development of our HBV therapy and our microbiome program. Thereafter, we will need additional capital to fund our operations in the future. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in raising any necessary additional capital on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If such event or other unforeseen circumstances occurred and we were unable to raise capital, we could be forced to discontinue product development, sacrifice attractive business opportunities, cease operations entirely and sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of our remaining assets.\nOur product candidates face significant development and regulatory hurdles prior to marketing which could delay or prevent licensing, sales and/or milestone revenue.\nBefore we or any commercial partner obtains the approvals necessary to sell any of our product candidate, we must show through pre-clinical studies and human testing in clinical trials that each potential product is safe and effective. The rates at which we complete our scientific studies and clinical trials depend on many factors, including, but are not limited to, our ability to obtain adequate supplies of the products to be tested and patient enrollment. Patient enrollment is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial and other potential drug candidates being studied. Delays in patient enrollment for our trials may result in increased costs and longer development times. In addition, we will need additional financing to develop our product candidates, which we might seek and receive from third party commercial partners. Further, we currently do not have the infrastructure to market and sell our product candidates. If we partner with one or more third party entities, those commercial partners may demand and receive rights to control product development and commercialization. As a result, these commercial partners may conduct these programs and activities more slowly or in a different manner than expected. If any of these events were to occur, the development of any product candidate could be significantly delayed, more expensive or less lucrative to us than anticipated, any of which would have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent on a license relationship for each of our HBV therapy and our microbiome program.\nOur license agreement with Indiana University Research and Technology Corporation, or IURTC, from whom we have licensed our HBV therapy, requires us to make milestone payments based upon the successful accomplishment of clinical and regulatory milestones related to our HBV therapy. The total amount of all potential future milestone payments at December 31, 2014 is $825,000. We also are obligated to pay IURTC royalty payments based on net sales of the licensed technology. We are also obligated to pay diligence maintenance fees ($25,000-$100,000) each year to the extent that the royalty, sublicensing, and milestone payments to IURTC are less than the diligence maintenance fee for that year. Our license with Therabiome, LLC, from whom we have licensed our microbiome program, also requires us to pay regulatory and clinical milestones as well as royalty payments to Therabiome. If we breach any of these obligations, we could lose our rights to our microbiome program. If we fail to comply with similar obligations to any other licensor, it would have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to commercialize drug candidates or technologies that were covered by the license. Also, the milestone and other payments associated with licenses will make it less profitable for us to develop our drug candidates than if we owned the technology ourselves.\nOur collaboration with Adam Zlotnick, the scientific founder of our HBV therapy is advantageous. If that collaboration is not maintained, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of our HBV therapy.\nDr. Adam Zlotnick is the founder of our HBV therapy. We have entered into a three-year consulting agreement with Dr. Zlotnick pursuant to which he serves as the Chairman of our Scientific Advisory Board and provides consulting services as we request. Dr. Zlotnick could refuse to extend the agreement after its three-year term expires or we could terminate the consulting agreement for cause or no cause. Although Dr. Zlotnick assigned to us any rights to intellectual property related to our HBV therapy that arise during the term of the consulting agreement, and while the consulting agreement contains a non-compete during the term of the agreement, the loss of Dr. Zlotnick\u2019s services could materially impair our ability to further the development of our HBV therapy.\nCorporate and academic collaborators might take actions to delay, prevent, or undermine the success of our product candidates.\nOur operating and financial strategy for the development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, and commercialization of drug candidates heavily depends on collaborating with corporations, academic institutions, licensors, licensees, and other parties. However, there can be no assurance that we will successfully establish these collaborations. In addition, should a collaboration be terminated, replacement collaborators might not be available on attractive terms, or at all. The activities of any collaborator will not be within our control and might not be within our power to influence. There can be no assurance that any collaborator will perform its obligations to our satisfaction or at all, that we will derive any revenue or profits from these collaborations, or that any collaborator will not compete with us. If any collaboration is not successful, we might require substantially greater capital to undertake development and marketing of our proposed products and might not be able to develop and market these products effectively, if at all. In addition, a lack of development and marketing collaborations might lead to significant delays in introducing proposed products into certain markets and/or reduced sales of proposed products in such markets.\nWe rely on data provided by our collaborators and others that has not been independently verified and could prove to be false, misleading, or incomplete.\nWe rely on third-party vendors, scientists, and collaborators to provide us with significant data and other information related to our projects, preclinical studies and clinical trials, and our business. If these third parties provide inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete data, our business, prospects, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nPreclinical and clinical testing required for our product candidates is expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is uncertain.\nIn order to obtain FDA approval to market a new drug product, we must demonstrate safety and effectiveness in humans. To meet these requirements, we must conduct extensive preclinical testing and sufficient adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Conducting clinical trials is a lengthy, time consuming, and expensive process. The length of time might vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty, and intended use of the product candidate, and often can be several years or more per trial. Delays associated with product candidates for which we are directly conducting preclinical studies or clinical trials might cause us to incur additional operating expenses. The commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials might be delayed by many factors, including, for example:\n\u00b7 the lack of effectiveness during clinical trials;\n\u00b7 the emergence of unforeseen safety issues;\n\u00b7 inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of qualified materials under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, for use in clinical trials;\n\u00b7 slower than expected rates of patient recruitment;\n\u00b7 failure to recruit a sufficient number of patients;\n\u00b7 modification of clinical trial protocols;\n\u00b7 changes in regulatory requirements for clinical trials;\n\u00b7 delays, suspension, or termination of clinical trials by the institutional review board or ethics committee responsible for overseeing the study at a particular study site; and\n\u00b7 government, institutional review board, ethics committee, or other regulatory delays or clinical holds requiring suspension or termination of the trials.\nThe results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials. Accordingly, even if we obtain or have obtained positive results from preclinical studies or early clinical trials, we might not achieve the same success in future clinical trials. For example, positive results were observed in earlier clinical trials of each of our two prior product candidates, but the subsequent clinical trials were not successful. Further, clinical trials might not provide statistically significant data supporting a product candidate\u2019s safety and effectiveness to meet the requisite regulatory approvals.\nWe have used and intend to continue to rely on one or more contract research organizations, or CROs, to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. We are highly dependent on these CROs to conduct our studies and trials in accordance with the requirements of the FDA and good scientific practice. In the event the CROs fail to perform their duties in such a fashion, we may not obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.\nThe failure of preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for the desired indications could harm the development of that product candidate and other product candidates. This failure could cause us to abandon a product candidate and could delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our preclinical studies or clinical trials would delay the filing of our New Drug Applications, or NDAs, with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues. Any change in, or termination of, our clinical trials could materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nUnforeseen safety issues could hinder the development of our product candidates and their adoption, if approved.\nSafety issues could arise during development of our product candidates, which might delay testing or prevent further development entirely. We have not yet tested our HBV therapy or our microbiome therapy in clinical trials and safety issues could arise during that planned testing or testing of any other product candidates. If a product is approved, any limitation on use that might be necessary could hinder its adoption in the marketplace. In addition, if any product is approved, it could be used against any instructions that we publish that limit its use, which could subject us to litigation.\nWe lack suitable facilities for certain preclinical and clinical testing and expect to rely on third parties to conduct some of our research and preclinical testing and our clinical trials and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such research, testing or trials.\nWe do not have sufficient facilities to conduct all of our anticipated preclinical and clinical testing. As a result, we expect to contract with third parties to conduct most or all preclinical and clinical testing required for regulatory approval for our product candidates. We currently plan to outsource all clinical testing to third parties and are reliant on the services of these third parties to conduct studies on our behalf. If we are unable to continue with or retain third parties for these purposes on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop our product candidates. In addition, any failures by third parties to adequately perform their responsibilities may delay the submission of our product candidates for regulatory approval, which would impair our financial condition and business prospects.\nOur reliance on these third parties for research and development activities also reduces our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal and regulatory requirements and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. Furthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. In addition, these third parties are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical and preclinical programs. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our research, preclinical studies or clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, regulatory approvals for our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and business prospects would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nWe will rely exclusively on third parties to formulate and manufacture our product candidates.\nWe do not have and do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities. Consequently, we lack the physical plant to formulate and manufacture our own product candidates. If any product candidate we might develop or acquire in the future receives FDA approval, we will rely on one or more third-party contractors to manufacture our products. If, for any reason, we become unable to rely on any future source to manufacture our product candidates, either for clinical trials or, at some future date, for commercial quantities, then we would need to identify and contract with additional or replacement third-party manufacturers to manufacture compounds for preclinical, clinical and commercial purposes. We might not be successful in identifying additional or replacement third-party manufacturers, or in negotiating acceptable terms with any that we do identify. If we are unable to secure and maintain third-party manufacturing capacity, the development and sales of our products and our financial performance might be materially affected.\nIn addition, before any of our collaborators can begin to commercially manufacture our product candidates, each manufacturing facility and process is subject to regulatory review. Manufacturing of drugs for clinical and commercial purposes must comply with the FDA\u2019s cGMPs, and applicable non-U.S. regulatory requirements. The cGMP requirements govern quality control and documentation policies and procedures. Complying with cGMP and non-U.S. regulatory requirements will require that we expend time, money, and effort in production, recordkeeping, and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. Any contracted manufacturing facility must also pass a pre-approval inspection prior to FDA approval. Failure to pass a pre-approval inspection might significantly delay FDA approval of our product candidates. If any of our future collaborators fails to comply with these requirements, it would be subject to possible regulatory action which could limit the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products, if approved. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations might be materially harmed.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following risks:\n\u00b7 We might be unable to identify manufacturers for commercial supply on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA must approve any replacement contractor. This approval would generally require compliance inspections. In addition, a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, production of our products after receipt of FDA approval, if any.\n\u00b7 Our third-party manufacturers might be unable to formulate and manufacture our product candidates in the volume and of the quality required to meet our clinical and, if approved, commercial needs.\n\u00b7 Our contract manufacturers might not perform as agreed or might not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute our products.\n\u00b7 One or more of our contract manufacturers could be foreign, which increases the risk of shipping delays and adds the risk of import restrictions.\n\u00b7 Drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other government regulations and corresponding foreign requirements. We would not have complete control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and requirements.\n\u00b7 If any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our product candidates, we might not own, or might have to share, the intellectual property rights to the innovation with our licensors.\n\u00b7 We might compete with other companies for access to these manufacturers\u2019 facilities and might be subject to manufacturing delays if the manufacturers give other clients higher priority than us.\nEach of these risks could delay our development efforts, preclinical studies and clinical trials or the approval, if any, of our product candidates by the FDA or the commercialization of our product candidates and could result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations might be materially harmed.\nIf we cannot compete successfully for market share against other drug companies, we might not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nIf our product candidates receive FDA approval, they will compete with a number of existing and future drugs and therapies developed, manufactured and marketed by others. Existing or future competing drugs might provide greater therapeutic convenience or clinical or other benefits for a specific indication than our product candidates, or might offer comparable performance at a lower cost. If our product candidates fail to capture and maintain market share, we might not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nWe might compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in:\n\u00b7 developing drugs;\n\u00b7 undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials;\n\u00b7 obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of drugs;\n\u00b7 formulating and manufacturing drugs; and\n\u00b7 launching, marketing and selling drugs.\nWe might not obtain the same resources and experience as our competitors. If we are unable to perform these tasks effectively and efficiently, our results of operations might be materially adversely affected.\nDevelopments by competitors might render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or non-competitive.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. In addition, the clinical and commercial landscape for HBV and CDAD is rapidly changing; we expect new data from commercial and clinical-stage products to continue to emerge. We will compete with organizations that have existing treatments and that are or will be developing treatments for the indications that our product candidates target. If our competitors develop effective treatments for HBV, CDAD or any other indication or field we might pursue, and successfully commercialize those treatments, our business and prospects might be materially harmed, due to intense competition in these markets.\nIf we are not able to develop collaborative marketing relationships with licensees or partners, or create an effective internal sales, marketing, and distribution capability, we might be unable to market our products successfully.\nTo market our product candidates, if approved, we will have to establish our own marketing and sales force or out-license our product candidates to, or collaborate with, larger firms with experience in marketing and selling pharmaceutical products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully establish our own marketing capabilities or establish marketing, sales, or distribution relationships with third parties; that such relationships, if established, will be successful; or that we will be successful in gaining market acceptance for our product candidates. To the extent that we enter into any marketing, sales, or distribution arrangements with third parties, our product revenues will be lower than if we marketed and sold our products directly, and any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties. If we are unable to establish such third-party sales and marketing relationships, or choose not to do so, we will have to establish our own in-house capabilities. We, as a company, have no experience in marketing or selling pharmaceutical products and currently have no sales, marketing, or distribution infrastructure. To market any of our products directly, we would need to develop a marketing, sales, and distribution force that both has technical expertise and the ability to support a distribution capability. To establish our own marketing, sales, and distribution capacity would significantly increase our costs, and require substantial additional capital. In addition, there is intense competition for proficient sales and marketing personnel, and we might not be able to attract individuals who have the qualifications necessary to market, sell, and distribute our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish internal marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities.\nPhysicians and patients might not accept and use our drugs.\nEven if the FDA approves one of our product candidates, physicians and patients might not accept and use it. Acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 perceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our product;\n\u00b7 cost-effectiveness of our product relative to competing products or therapies;\n\u00b7 availability of reimbursement for our product from government or other healthcare payors; and\n\u00b7 effective marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.\nIf our current product candidates are approved, we expect sales to generate substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future, and as a result, the failure of these products to find market acceptance would harm our business and would require us to seek additional financing.\nEven if we are able to commercialize any product candidates, those products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new medicines vary widely from country to country. In the United States, recently enacted legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a medicine before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a medicine in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the medicine, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the medicine in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nOur ability to commercialize any medicines successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these medicines and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any product candidate that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining reimbursement for newly approved medicines, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the medicine is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any medicine will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new medicines, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the medicine and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost medicines and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for medicines may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of medicines from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved product candidates that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize product candidates and our overall financial condition.\nIf we lose key management or scientific personnel, cannot recruit qualified employees, directors, officers, or other significant personnel or experience increases in our compensation costs, our business might materially suffer.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of our Chief Executive Officer and President, Derek Small, our Chief Medical Officer and Vice President of Research and Development, Dr. Uri Lopatin, our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Lee D. Arnold, and our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, David J. Barrett. Our employment agreements with Mr. Small, Dr. Lopatin, Dr. Arnold and Mr. Barrett do not ensure their retention. This is also true for our other management team members, both present and future.\nFurthermore, our future success also depends, in part, on our ability to identify, hire, and retain additional management team members as our operations grow. We expect to experience intense competition for qualified personnel and might be unable to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business. Finally, we do not currently maintain, nor do we intend to obtain in the future, \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance that would compensate us in the event of the death or disability of any of the members of our management team.\nThe failure by us to retain, attract and motivate executives and other key employees could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we cannot enforce non-compete and confidentiality provisions applicable to our employees and consultants, our business might materially suffer.\nWe include a non-compete provision in any employment agreement we enter into with an employee, including those for Messrs. Small, Barrett, Lopatin and Arnold, that runs during the term of the agreement and for a period of time after termination, depending on the individual.\nWe include a confidentiality provision in any employment or consulting agreement we enter into with an employee or a consultant. The confidentiality provision runs during the term of the agreement and thereafter without limit.\nFor future employees with whom we do not enter into an employment agreement, we will enter into a confidentiality agreement with the same provisions described above.\nTo be able to enforce these non-compete and confidentiality provisions we would need to know of any breach and have sufficient funds to enforce the provisions. We cannot assure you that we would know of or be able to afford enforcement of any breach. In addition, such provisions are subject to state law and interpretation by courts, which could limit the scope and duration of these provisions. Any limitation on or non-enforcement of these non-compete and confidentiality provisions could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIf we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business might be harmed.\nAs of February 28, 2015, we had 21 employees, and various consultants and multiple contract research organizations with whom we have contracted. We will need to hire or contract with additional qualified personnel with expertise in clinical research and testing, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing and sales and marketing to commercialize our HBV therapy and our microbiome program or any other product candidate we may seek to develop. We compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Competition for these individuals is intense, and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success.\nWe might not successfully manage our growth.\nOur success will depend upon the expansion of our operations and the effective management of our growth, which will place a significant strain on our current and future management and other administrative and operational resources. To manage this growth, we must expand our facilities, augment our operational, financial and management systems and hire and train additional qualified personnel. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business would be harmed.\nWe might seek to develop our business through acquisitions of or investment in new or complementary businesses, products or technologies, and the failure to manage these acquisitions or investments, or the failure to integrate them with our existing business, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe might consider opportunities to acquire or invest in other technologies, products and businesses that might enhance our capabilities or complement our current product candidates. Potential and completed acquisitions and strategic investments involve numerous risks, including potential problems or issues associated with the following:\n\u00b7 assimilating the purchased technologies, products or business operations;\n\u00b7 maintaining uniform standards, procedures, controls and policies;\n\u00b7 unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or investment;\n\u00b7 diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our preexisting business;\n\u00b7 maintaining or obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals or complying with regulatory requirements; and\n\u00b7 adverse effects on existing business operations.\nWe have no current commitments with respect to any acquisition or investment in other technologies or businesses. We do not know if we will identify suitable acquisitions, whether we will be able to successfully complete any acquisitions, or whether we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired product, technology or business into our business or retain key personnel, suppliers or collaborators.\nOur ability to successfully develop our business through acquisitions would depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable target businesses or technologies and obtain any necessary financing. These efforts could be expensive and time consuming and might disrupt our ongoing operations. If we are unable to efficiently integrate any acquired business, technology or product into our business, our business and financial condition might be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory and Legal Environment\nWe are subject to extensive and costly government regulation.\nProduct candidates employing our technology are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulation including regulation by the FDA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, state and local governments, and their respective foreign equivalents. The FDA regulates the research, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, record-keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import, and export of pharmaceutical products. The FDA regulates small molecule chemical entities, whether administered orally, topically or by injection, as drugs, subject to an NDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. If products employing our technologies are marketed abroad, they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments, whether or not they have obtained FDA approval for a given product and its uses. Such foreign regulation might be equally or more demanding than corresponding U.S. regulation.\nGovernment regulation substantially increases the cost and risk of researching, developing, manufacturing, and selling our product candidates. The regulatory review and approval process, which includes preclinical testing and clinical trials of each product candidate, is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. We or our collaborators must obtain and maintain regulatory authorization to conduct clinical trials and approval for each product we intend to market, and the manufacturing facilities used for the products must be inspected and meet legal requirements. Securing regulatory approval requires submitting extensive preclinical and clinical data and other supporting information for each proposed therapeutic indication in order to establish the product\u2019s safety and efficacy for each intended use. The development and approval process might take many years, requires substantial resources, and might never lead to the approval of a product.\nEven if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for a particular product, the approval might limit the intended medical uses for the product, limit our ability to promote, sell, and distribute the product, require that we conduct costly post-marketing surveillance, and/or require that we conduct ongoing post-marketing studies. Material changes to an approved product, such as, for example, manufacturing changes or revised labeling, might require further regulatory review and approval. Once obtained, any approvals might be withdrawn, including, for example, if there is a later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product, such as a previously unknown safety issue.\nIf we, our collaborators, or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process, such noncompliance could result in, among other things, delays in the approval of applications or supplements to approved applications; refusal of a regulatory authority, including the FDA, to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approved applications; untitled letters or warning letters; fines; import and export restrictions; product recalls or seizures; injunctions; total or partial suspension of production; civil penalties; withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications; recommendations by the FDA or other regulatory authorities against governmental contracts; and/or criminal prosecutions.\nWe might not obtain the necessary U.S. or worldwide regulatory approvals to commercialize any product candidate.\nWe cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize for sale any of our product candidates, or any product candidate we acquire or develop in the future. We will need FDA approval to commercialize our product candidates in the U.S. and approvals from the FDA-equivalent regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions to commercialize our product candidates in those jurisdictions. In order to obtain FDA approval of any product candidate, we must submit to the FDA an NDA demonstrating that the product candidate is safe for humans and effective for its intended use. This demonstration requires significant research, preclinical studies, and clinical trials. Satisfaction of the FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depends upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate and requires substantial resources for research, development and testing. We cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in drugs that the FDA considers safe for humans and effective for their indicated uses. The FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process and might require us to conduct additional preclinical and clinical testing, perform post-marketing studies or otherwise limit or impose conditions on any approval we obtain. For example, the FDA proposed that we include an additional treatment arm in our pivotal Phase III trial for our former product candidate iferanserin, which increased the cost of that trial.\nThe approval process might also be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals might:\n\u00b7 delay commercialization of, and our ability to derive product revenues from, our product candidates;\n\u00b7 impose costly procedures on us; and\n\u00b7 diminish any competitive advantages that we might otherwise enjoy.\nEven if we comply with all FDA requests, the FDA might ultimately reject one or more of our NDAs. We cannot be sure that we will ever obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. Failure to obtain FDA approval of our product candidates will severely undermine our business by leaving us without a saleable product, and therefore without any source of revenues, until another product candidate could be developed or obtained. There is no guarantee that we will ever be able to develop an existing, or acquire another, product candidate.\nIn foreign jurisdictions, we must receive approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities before we can commercialize any product candidates. The risks associated with foreign regulatory approval processes are similar to the risks associated with the FDA approval procedures described above. We cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize our product candidates for sale outside the U.S.\nEven if approved, our product candidates will be subject to extensive post-approval regulation.\nOnce a product candidate is approved, numerous post-approval requirements apply. Among other things, the holder of an approved NDA is subject to ongoing FDA oversight monitoring and reporting obligations, including obligations to monitor and report adverse events and instances of the failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. Application holders must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process, depending on the nature of the change. Application holders also must submit advertising and other promotional material to the FDA and report on ongoing clinical trials. The FDA also has the authority to require changes in the labeling of approved drug products and to require post-marketing studies.\nAdvertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules in addition to other applicable federal and state laws. The distribution of product samples to physicians must comply with the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act. Manufacturing facilities remain subject to FDA inspection and must continue to adhere to the FDA\u2019s cGMP requirements. Sales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs, among other activities, must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act, and similar state laws, each as amended. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veteran\u2019s Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.\nDepending on the circumstances, failure to meet these post-approval requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. In addition, even if we comply with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or effectiveness of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval.\nWe face the risk of product liability claims and might not be able to obtain insurance.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the development of drugs. If the use of one or more of our or our collaborators\u2019 drugs harms people, we might be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims brought against us by clinical trial participants, consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling our products. Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop. We expect to obtain clinical trial insurance for our product candidates prior to beginning clinical trials. We cannot predict all of the possible harms or side effects that might result and, therefore, the amount of insurance coverage we obtain, if any, in the future might not be adequate to cover all liabilities we might incur. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include product liability insurance covering the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates in development, but we might be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims, we will be exposed to significant liabilities, which might materially and adversely affect our business and financial position. If we are sued for any injury allegedly caused by our or our collaborators\u2019 products, our liability could exceed our total assets and our ability to pay the liability. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us would decrease our cash and could cause the value of our common stock to decrease.\nWe might be exposed to liability claims associated with the use of hazardous materials and chemicals.\nOur research, development and manufacturing activities and/or those of our third-party contractors might involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. Although we will strive to have our safety procedures, and those of our contractors, for using, storing, handling and disposing of these materials comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials and waste products might require us to incur substantial compliance costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We currently do not carry hazardous materials liability insurance. We intend to obtain such insurance in the future if necessary, but cannot give assurance that we could obtain such coverage.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur business depends on protecting our intellectual property.\nIf we and our licensors IURTC and Therabiome do not obtain protection for our respective intellectual property rights, our competitors might be able to take advantage of our research and development efforts to develop competing drugs. Our success, competitive position and future revenues, if any, depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.\nWe seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and medicines that are important to our business. To date, although our licensors have filed patent applications, we do not own or have any rights to any issued patents that cover any of our product candidates, and we cannot be certain that we will secure any rights to any issued patents with claims that cover any of our proprietary medicines and technologies. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection.\nThe patent process also is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting our products by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u00b7 Any patent rights, if obtained, might be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or otherwise might not provide any competitive advantage;\n\u00b7 Our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do and many of which might make significant investments in competing technologies, might seek, or might already have obtained, patents that will limit, interfere with, or eliminate our ability to make, use, and sell our potential products either in the U.S. or in international markets;\n\u00b7 As a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns, there might be significant pressure on the U.S. government and other international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the U.S. for disease treatments that prove successful; and\n\u00b7 Countries other than the U.S. might have patent laws that provide less protection than those governing U.S. courts, allowing foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop, and market competing products.\nIn addition, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Thus, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents might be substantially narrower than anticipated.\nPatent and other intellectual property protection is crucial to the success of our business and prospects, and there is a substantial risk that such protections, if obtained, will prove inadequate. Our business and prospects will be harmed if we fail to obtain these protections or they prove insufficient.\nWe might be involved from time to time in litigation to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of our proprietary rights. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost and divert management\u2019s attention from our operations.\nWe rely on trade secret protections through confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers and other parties, and the breach of these agreements could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality, invention, and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, scientific advisors, consultants, collaborators, suppliers, and other parties. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by our competitors. If any of these events occurs, or we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know-how, the value of this information may be greatly reduced.\nIf we infringe the rights of third parties we might have to forgo selling our future products, pay damages, or defend against litigation.\nIf our product candidates, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we might have to:\n\u00b7 obtain licenses, which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u00b7 abandon an infringing product candidate;\n\u00b7 redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u00b7 stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others;\n\u00b7 pay damages; and/or\n\u00b7 defend litigation or administrative proceedings which might be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nAny of these events could substantially harm our earnings, financial condition and operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe might not be able to maintain the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nOur common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol \u201cASMB.\u201d We might not be able to maintain the listing standards of that exchange. If we fail to maintain the listing requirements, our common stock might trade on the OTC Bulletin Board or in the \u201cpink sheets\u201d maintained by Pink OTC Markets, Inc. These alternative markets are generally considered to be markets that are less efficient and less broad than The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nThe price of our common stock might fluctuate significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nSince we went public on December 22, 2010 and through February 27, 2015, the closing price of our common stock has fluctuated between $4.30 and $101.25 (after giving effect to the 1-for-5 reverse stock split effected on July 11, 2014), with significant volatility after we announced on June 25, 2012 that our prior product candidate iferanserin failed to meet the endpoints of our Phase III trial, and after we announced in February 2014 that our prior product candidate diltiazem demonstrated no significant improvement compared to placebo. Continued volatility in the market price of our common stock might prevent you from being able to sell your shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid for such shares. The trading price of our common stock might be volatile and subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors, including:\n\u00b7 the receipt or loss of required regulatory approvals for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 results of our preclinical studies and clinical trials and other studies involving our product candidates;\n\u00b7 availability of capital;\n\u00b7 future sales of our common stock;\n\u00b7 sale of shares of our common stock by our significant stockholders or members of our management;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 investor perceptions of us and the pharmaceutical industry;\n\u00b7 issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations, or the announcement of any changes to our credit rating;\n\u00b7 success or failure of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 introduction of new products or announcements of significant contracts, acquisitions or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 threatened or actual litigation and government investigations;\n\u00b7 legislative, political or regulatory developments;\n\u00b7 the overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results;\n\u00b7 general economic conditions;\n\u00b7 changes in interest rates; and\n\u00b7 changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles.\nThese and other factors might cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which might limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of our common stock and might otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies across many industries. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Accordingly, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAt February 27, 2015, our executive officers, directors and one of our founders beneficially owned approximately 28% of our outstanding voting common stock. Therefore, these stockholders have the ability to influence us through their ownership position. These stockholders may be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and our stock may not appreciate in value.\nWe currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the operation and growth of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or that the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares will be able to be maintained.\nThe requirements of being a public company add to our operating costs and might strain our resources and distract our management.\nAs a public company, we face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses not faced by private companies. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition, and the rules and regulations implemented by the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and The NASDAQ Capital Market, each of which imposes additional reporting and other obligations on public companies. These rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. Complying with these requirements might divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our prospects, business, and financial condition.\nAdditionally, the expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. These increased costs will require us to divert a significant amount of money that we could otherwise use to develop our product candidates or otherwise expand our business. If we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nSeveral provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition, which could adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nSeveral provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, and the market price of our securities could be reduced as a result. These provisions may include:\n\u00b7 prohibiting us from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless certain provisions are met;\n\u00b7 prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u00b7 limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u00b7 establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\nIf securities analysts downgrade our stock or cease coverage of us, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. Currently, two financial analysts publish reports about us and our business. We do not control these or any other analysts. Furthermore, there are many large, well-established, publicly traded companies active in our industry and market, which may mean that it is less likely that we will receive widespread analyst coverage. If any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline rapidly. If these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.", "PERMNO": 12497, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ASMB"}
