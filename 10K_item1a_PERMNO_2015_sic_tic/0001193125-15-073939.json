RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves significant risks, some of which are described below. You should carefully consider these risks, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below, as well as additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\nOur business has been and in the future may be materially adversely affected by the price and availability of aircraft fuel. High fuel costs and increases in fuel prices or a shortage or disruption in the supply of aircraft fuel would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe price of aircraft fuel may be high or volatile. The cost of aircraft fuel is highly volatile and is our largest individual operating expense, accounting for 35.8%, 37.7%, and 39.4% of our operating expenses for 2014, 2013, and 2012. High fuel costs or increases in fuel costs (or in the price of crude oil) could materially adversely affect our business. Since August 2014, the price of jet fuel has fallen by approximately fifty percent, which benefits us by lowering our expenses. However, because fuel prices are highly volatile, the price of jet fuel may increase significantly at any time. We may be more susceptible to fuel-price volatility than most of our competitors since fuel represents a larger proportion of our total costs due to the longer average stage length of our flights.\nAvailability of aircraft fuel may be low. Our business is also dependent on the availability of aircraft fuel (or crude oil), which is not predictable. Weather-related events, natural disasters, terrorism, wars, political disruption or instability involving oil-producing countries, changes in governmental or cartel policy concerning crude oil or aircraft fuel production, labor strikes or other events affecting refinery production, transportation, taxes or marketing, environmental concerns, market manipulation, price speculation and other unpredictable events may drive actual or perceived fuel supply shortages. Shortages in the availability of, or increases in demand for, crude oil in general, other crude-oil-based fuel derivatives and aircraft fuel in particular could result in increased fuel prices and could materially adversely affect our business.\nFare increases may not cover increased fuel costs. We may not be able to increase ticket prices sufficiently to cover increased fuel costs, particularly when fuel prices rise quickly. We sell a significant number of tickets to passengers well in advance of travel, and, as a result, fares sold for future travel may not reflect increased fuel costs. In addition, our ability to increase ticket prices to offset an increase in fuel costs is limited by the competitive nature of the airline industry and the price sensitivity associated with air travel, particularly leisure travel, and any increases in fares may reduce the general demand for air travel.\nOur fuel hedging program may not be effective. We cannot assure you our fuel hedging program, including our forward fixed price contracts, or FFPs, which we use as part of our hedging strategy, will be effective or that we will maintain a fuel hedging program. Even if we are able to hedge portions of our future fuel requirements, we cannot guarantee that our hedge contracts will provide an adequate level of protection against increased fuel costs or that the counterparties to our hedge contracts will be able to perform. Certain of our fuel hedge contracts may contain margin funding requirements that could require us to post collateral to counterparties in the event of a significant drop in fuel prices. For example, the recent decrease in the price of jet fuel has triggered unrealized losses on certain hedge positions of $27.1 million at December 31, 2014. Additionally, our ability to realize the benefit of declining fuel prices will be delayed by the impact of fuel hedges in place, and we may record significant losses on fuel hedges during periods of declining prices. A failure of our fuel hedging strategy,\nsignificant margin funding requirements, overpaying for fuel through the use of FFPs or our failure to maintain a fuel hedging program could prevent us from adequately mitigating the risk of fuel price increases and could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe airline industry is exceedingly competitive, and we compete against both legacy airlines and low-cost carriers; if we are not able to compete successfully in the domestic airline industry, our business will be materially adversely affected.\nThe domestic airline industry is characterized by significant competition from both large legacy airlines and low-cost carriers, or LCCs. Airlines compete for passengers with a variety of fares, discounts, route networks, flight schedules, flight frequencies, frequent flyer programs and other products and services, including seating, food, entertainment and other on-board amenities. Airlines also compete on the basis of customer-service performance statistics, such as on-time arrivals, customer complaints and mishandled baggage reports. We face significant competition from both large legacy airlines and LCCs on the routes we operate, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business will be materially adversely affected.\nLarge legacy airlines have numerous competitive advantages in competing for airline passengers, particularly following the consolidation in the domestic airline industry that occurred between 2008 and 2013, which resulted in the creation of four dominant domestic airlines with significant breadth of network coverage and financial resources. We face competition from one or more of these legacy carriers with respect to nearly all of the routes we serve. The legacy carriers have a number of competitive advantages relative to us that may enable them to attain higher average fares, more passenger traffic and a greater percentage of business passengers than we attain. These advantages include a much larger route network with domestic and international connections, more flights and convenient flight schedules in routes that overlap with ours. These carriers also offer frequent flyer programs and lounge access benefits that reward and create loyalty with travelers, particularly business travelers. Moreover, several legacy carriers have corporate travel contracts that direct employees to fly with a preferred carrier. The enormous route networks operated by these airlines, combined with their marketing and partnership relationships with regional airlines and international alliance partner carriers, allow them to generate increased passenger traffic from domestic and international cities. Our smaller, point-to-point route network and lack of connecting traffic and marketing alliances puts us at a competitive disadvantage to legacy carriers, particularly with respect to our appeal to higher-fare business travelers.\nEach of the legacy carriers operates a much larger fleet of aircraft and has greater financial resources than we do, which permits them to add service in response to our entry into new markets. For example, United Airlines operates a hub at San Francisco International Airport (SFO) and has engaged in aggressive competitive practices, such as increasing seat capacity by introducing larger-gauge aircraft or adding incremental flights in response to our entry into new markets served from SFO. Due to our relatively small size, we are more susceptible to a fare war or other competitive activities in one or more of the markets we serve, which could prevent us from attaining the level of passenger traffic or maintaining the level of ticket sales required to sustain profitable operations in new or existing markets.\nLCCs also have numerous competitive advantages in competing for airline passengers. LCCs generally offer a more basic service to travelers and therefore have lower cost structures than other airlines. The lower cost structure of LCCs permits them to offer flights to and from many of the same markets as most major airlines, which are defined by the U.S. Department of Transportation, or DOT, as U.S.-based air carriers with annual operating revenues in excess of one billion dollars during a fiscal year, but at lower prices. LCCs also typically fly direct, point-to-point flights, which tends to improve aircraft and crew scheduling efficiency. Many LCCs also provide only a single class of service, thereby avoiding the incremental cost of offering premium-class services like those that we offer.\nIn addition, some LCCs have a relentless focus on lowering costs and provide only a very basic level of service to passengers. These carriers configure their aircraft with high-density seating configurations and offer\nminimal amenities during the flight, and as a result, they incur lower unit costs than we do. Some LCCs also charge ancillary fees for basic services that we provide free of charge, such as making a reservation, printing boarding passes at the airport and carrying bags onboard the cabin for stowage in the overhead bins. In general, LCCs have lower unit costs and therefore are able to offer lower base fares.\nIf we fail to implement our business strategy successfully, our business will be materially adversely affected.\nOur business strategy is to target business and leisure travelers who are willing to pay a premium for our newer aircraft, more comfortable seating, better customer service and the latest on-board amenities while maintaining a cost structure that is lower than that of the legacy airlines that these business and premium travelers have historically favored. We may not be successful in attracting enough passengers willing to pay a premium over the fares offered by the LCCs, which we require to offset the additional costs embedded within our premium service model. In addition, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and JetBlue Airways are increasing the quality of their seating and on-board amenities in some of the routes where they compete with us, making it more challenging to attract passengers who are loyal to those airlines. Continuing to grow our business profitably is also critical to our business strategy. Growth poses various operational and financial challenges, including securing additional financing for aircraft acquisition, obtaining airport gates and facilities at congested airports that serve business and premium travelers and hiring qualified personnel while maintaining our culture, which we believe is vital to the continued success of our airline. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully and profitably expand our fleet, enter new markets or grow existing markets in order to achieve additional economies of scale and maintain or increase our profitability. If we are unsuccessful in deploying our strategy, or if our strategy is unsustainable, our business will be materially adversely affected.\nThreatened or actual terrorist attacks or security concerns involving airlines could materially adversely affect our business.\nPast terrorist attacks against airlines have caused substantial revenue losses and increased security costs. As a result, any actual or threatened terrorist attack or security breach, even if not directly against an airline, could materially adversely affect our business by weakening the demand for air travel and resulting in increased safety and security costs for us and the airline industry generally. Terrorist attacks made directly on a domestic airline, or the fear of such attacks or other hostilities (including elevated national threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights due to terror threats), would have a negative impact on the airline industry and materially adversely affect our business.\nWe rely heavily on technology and automated systems to operate our business, and any failure of these technologies or systems could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are highly dependent on technology and computer systems and networks to operate our business. These technologies and systems include our computerized airline reservation system, flight operations systems, telecommunications systems, airline website, maintenance systems and check-in kiosks.\nIn order for our operations to work efficiently, our website and reservation system must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic, maintain secure information and deliver flight information. We depend on our reservation system, which is hosted and maintained under a long-term contract by a third-party service provider, to issue, track and accept electronic tickets, conduct check-in, board and manage our passengers through the airports we serve and provide us with access to global distribution systems, which enlarge our pool of potential passengers. In May 2011, we experienced significant reservations system outages, which resulted in lost ticket sales on our website which materially adversely affected our business and goodwill. If our reservation system fails or experiences interruptions again, and we are unable to book seats for any period of time, we could lose a significant amount of revenue as customers book seats on other airlines, and our reputation could be harmed.\nWe also rely on third-party service providers to maintain our flight operations systems, and if those systems are not functioning, we could experience service disruptions, which could result in the loss of important data, increase our expenses, decrease our operational performance and temporarily stall our operations. Replacement services may not be readily available on a timely basis, at competitive rates or at all, and any transition time to a new system may be significant. In the event that one or more of our primary technology or systems vendors fails to perform and a replacement system is not available, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected from an accident or safety incident involving our aircraft.\nAn accident or safety incident involving one of our aircraft could expose us to significant liability and a public perception that our airline is unsafe or unreliable. In the event of a major accident, we could be subject to significant personal injury and property claims. While we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice, the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to cover fully all claims, and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident. In addition, any accident or incident involving one of our aircraft (or an accident involving another Virgin-branded airline), even if fully insured, could harm our reputation and result in a loss of future passenger demand if it creates a public perception that our operation is unsafe or unreliable as compared to other airlines or means of transportation. As a result, any accident or safety incident involving our aircraft could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe demand for airline services is sensitive to changes in economic conditions, and another recession would weaken demand for our services and materially adversely affect our business.\nThe demand for business and leisure travel is affected by U.S. and global economic conditions. Unfavorable economic conditions have historically reduced airline travel spending. For most leisure consumers, travel is a discretionary expense, and during unfavorable economic conditions, travelers have often replaced air travel with car travel or other forms of ground transportation or have opted not to travel at all. Likewise, during unfavorable economic conditions, businesses have foregone or deferred air travel. Travelers have also reduced spending by purchasing less expensive tickets, which can result in a decrease in average revenue per seat. Because we have relatively high fixed costs, much of which cannot be mitigated during periods of lower demand for air travel, our business is particularly sensitive to changes in U.S. economic conditions. A reduction in the demand for air travel due to unfavorable economic conditions also limits our ability to raise fares to counteract increased fuel, labor and other costs. If U.S. or global economic conditions are unfavorable or uncertain for an extended period of time, it would materially adversely affect our business.\nWe have a limited operating history and have only recorded two years of profit, and we may not sustain or increase profitability in the future.\nWe have a history of losses and only a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. While we recorded an annual profit in 2013 and 2014, we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or an annual basis. In turn, this may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and may materially adversely affect our business.\nAirlines are subject to extensive regulation and taxation by governmental authorities, and compliance with new regulations and any new or higher taxes will increase our operating costs and may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements. Congress regularly passes laws that affect the airline industry, and the DOT, the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and the Transportation Security Administration, or TSA, continually issue regulations, orders, rulings and guidance relating to the operation, safety and security of airlines that require significant expenditures and investment by us. For example, the DOT has broad authority over airlines to prevent unfair and deceptive practices and has used this authority to impose numerous airline regulations, including rules and fines relating to airline advertising,\npricing, baggage compensation, denied boarding compensation and tarmac delayed flights. The DOT frequently considers the adoption of new regulations, such as rules relating to congestion-based landing fees at airports and limits or disclosures concerning ancillary passenger fees. For example, in June 2014, the DOT issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to further enhance passenger protections that addresses several areas of regulation, including post-purchase ticket increases, ancillary fee disclosures and code-share data reporting and disclosure. Compliance with existing requirements drives administrative, legal and operational costs and subjects us to potential fines, and any new regulatory requirements issued by the DOT may increase our compliance costs, reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our business.\nThe FAA has broad authority to address airline safety issues, including inspection authority over our flight, technical and safety operations, and has the ability to issue mandatory orders relating to, among other things, the grounding of aircraft, installation of mandatory equipment and removal and replacement of aircraft parts that have failed or may fail in the future. Any decision by the FAA to require aircraft inspections, complete aircraft maintenance or ground aircraft types operated by us could materially adversely affect our business. For example, on January 4, 2014, the FAA\u2019s new and more stringent pilot flight and duty time requirements under Part 117 of the Federal Aviation Regulations took effect, which has increased costs and could further increase our costs in the future.\nThe FAA also has extensive authority to address airspace/airport congestion issues and has imposed limitations on take-off and landing slots at four airports: Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), LaGuardia Airport (LGA), John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR). The FAA could reduce the number of slots allocated at these airports or impose new slot restrictions at other airports.\nThe Port Authority of New York & New Jersey maintains a so-called \u201cperimeter rule\u201d that prohibits weekday non-stop flights longer than 1,500 miles from LGA, a restriction that does not exist at JFK and EWR. We currently have a limited number of take-off and landing slots at LGA, compared to certain of our competitors. If the LGA perimeter rule were relaxed or eliminated, it could increase competition at LGA for high-revenue longer haul routes favored by business travelers and higher revenue passengers. If New York business travelers and higher revenue passengers elect to travel out of LGA rather than JFK and EWR, airports that farther from Manhattan, we may not have sufficient slots to compete, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are also subject to restrictions imposed by federal law that require that no more than 24.9% of our stock be voted, directly or indirectly, by persons who are not U.S. citizens, that no more than 49.9% of our outstanding stock be owned by persons who are not U.S. citizens and that our president and at least two-thirds of the members of our board of directors and senior management be U.S. citizens. For more information on these requirements, see \u201c-Our corporate charter and bylaws include provisions limiting voting and ownership by non-U.S. citizens and specifying an exclusive forum for stockholder disputes.\u201d We are currently in compliance with these ownership restrictions. Our high level of foreign ownership may limit our opportunity to participate in U.S. government travel contracts and the Civilian Reserve Air Fleet program, however, if we are unable to satisfy policies and procedures of the U.S. Department of Defense for the mitigation of foreign ownership, control or influence required of cleared U.S. contractors.\nDomestic airlines are also subject to significant taxation, including taxes on jet fuel, passenger tickets and security fees to compensate the federal government for its role in regulating airlines, providing air traffic controls and implementing security measures related to airlines and airports. In July 2014, the TSA implemented an increased passenger security fee at a flat rate of $5.60 per passenger. Any significant increase in ticket taxes or security fees could weaken the demand for air travel, increase our costs and materially adversely affect our business.\nMany aspects of airlines\u2019 operations are also subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations, and growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional regulation. Since the domestic\nairline industry is highly price sensitive, we may not be able to recover from our passengers the cost of compliance with new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations, which could materially adversely affect our business. Although we do not expect the costs of complying with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, we cannot assure you that the costs of complying with environmental regulations would not materially adversely affect us in the future.\nAlmost all commercial service airports are owned and/or operated by units of local or state governments. Airlines are largely dependent on these governmental entities to provide adequate airport facilities and capacity at an affordable cost. Many airports have increased their rates and charges to air carriers because of higher security costs, increased costs related to updated infrastructures and other costs. Additional laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce the demand for air travel. Although lawmakers may impose these additional fees and consider them \u201cpass-through\u201d costs, we believe that a higher total ticket price will influence consumer purchase and travel decisions and may result in an overall decline in passenger traffic, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to obtain financing or access capital markets may be limited.\nWe have significant obligations to purchase aircraft and spare engines that we have on order from Airbus and CFM International, or CFM, and we have historically relied solely on lessors to provide financing for our aircraft acquisition needs. As of December 31, 2014, committed expenditures for these aircraft and spare engines, including estimated amounts for contractual price escalations and $94.3 million of pre-delivery payment commitments, were approximately $396.1 million. Because we may not have sufficient liquidity or creditworthiness to fund the purchase of aircraft and engines, including payment of pre-delivery payments, we expect to seek external financing for these expenses. There are a number of factors that may affect our ability to raise financing or access the capital markets, including our liquidity and credit status, our operating cash flows, market conditions in the airline industry, U.S. and global economic conditions, the general state of the capital markets and the financial position of the major providers of commercial aircraft financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to source external financing for our planned aircraft acquisitions or for other significant capital needs, and if we are unable to source financing on acceptable terms, or unable to source financing at all, our business could be materially adversely affected. To the extent we finance our activities with additional debt, we may become subject to financial and other covenants that may restrict our ability to pursue our strategy or otherwise constrain our growth and operations.\nIn addition, we may be unable to fully finance future aircraft acquisitions if the aircraft are perceived to be less valuable for any reason. We presently have ten Airbus A320-family, current technology aircraft on order for delivery between July 2015 and June 2016. If Airbus\u2019s newer A320neo-family aircraft provide expected improvements in the fuel consumption and an increase in nautical mile range, the Airbus A320-family current-technology aircraft may be perceived to be less valuable. If we are unable to fully finance our acquisition of these aircraft, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nThe \u201cVirgin\u201d brand is not under our control, and negative publicity related to the Virgin brand name could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe believe the \u201cVirgin\u201d brand, which is integral to our corporate identity, represents quality, innovation, creativity, fun, a sense of competitive challenge and employee-friendliness. We license rights to the Virgin brand from certain entities affiliated with the Virgin Group on a non-exclusive basis. The Virgin brand is also licensed to and used by a number of other companies, including two airlines, Virgin Atlantic Airways and Virgin Australia Airlines, operating in other geographies. We rely on the general goodwill of consumers and our employees, whom we call teammates, towards the Virgin brand as part of our internal corporate culture and external marketing strategy. Consequently, any adverse publicity in relation to the Virgin brand name or its principals, particularly Sir Richard Branson who is closely associated with the brand, or in relation to another\nVirgin-branded company over which we have no control or influence, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe obtain our rights to use the Virgin brand under agreements with certain entities affiliated with the Virgin Group, and we would lose those rights if these agreements are terminated or not renewed.\nWe are party to license agreements with certain entities affiliated with the Virgin Group pursuant to which we obtain rights to use the Virgin brand. The licensor may terminate the agreements upon the occurrence of a number of specified events including if we commit a material breach of our obligations under the agreements that is uncured for more than 10 business days or if we materially damage the Virgin brand. If we lose our rights to use the Virgin brand, we would lose the goodwill associated with our brand name and be forced to develop a new brand name, which would likely require substantial expenditures, and our business would likely be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to labor-related disruptions that could materially adversely affect our business.\nOn August 13, 2014, our inflight teammates (whom other airlines refer to as flight attendants), representing approximately 32% of our workforce at the time, voted for representation by the Transport Workers Union, or TWU. As a result, the TWU has been certified as the representative of our inflight teammates, and we will be engaged with the TWU in a collective bargaining process for a first contract for those teammates in accordance with the requirements of the Railway Labor Act. Although we currently have a direct relationship with our remaining teammates, airline workers are one of the most heavily unionized private-sector employee groups, and any of our other non-management teammates could also seek to unionize. If we are not able to reach agreement with the TWU on the terms of the collective bargaining agreement for our inflight teammates, or if one or more of our other teammate groups elects a union to represent them, it could create a risk of work stoppages which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the Los Angeles and San Francisco markets to be successful.\nMost of our current flights operate from our two focus cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco. In 2014, passengers to and from Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and to and from SFO accounted for 43.2% and 54.1% of our total passengers. We believe that concentrating our service offerings in this way allows us to maximize our investment in personnel, aircraft and ground facilities and to leverage sales and marketing efforts in those regions. As a result, we are highly dependent on the LAX and SFO markets.\nAt LAX, we operate out of Terminal Three under an airport lease agreement that runs through 2019, subject to our completion of certain leasehold improvement projects. Under the LAX lease, we have the preferential use of six airport gates with the opportunity to build a new seventh gate with a jet-boarding bridge, and shared access with other airlines to additional common-use gates. At SFO, we primarily operate out of recently renovated Terminal Two, under an operating lease that runs through June 2021, with the occasional use of a gate in the international terminal for flights from Mexico. Under the SFO lease, we have preferential access to seven Terminal Two gates, shared access with other airlines to one common-use Terminal Two gate and shared access to international terminal gates. In the past, we have used SFO international gates for domestic flights. While gate space is limited at both LAX and SFO, we believe that our gate access at each airport is capable of handling our planned growth in operations for at least the next several years.\nHowever, both LAX and SFO are high-traffic airports with limited excess facilities and capacity, which may restrict our growth at these two bases or may even constrict our existing operations. If either LAX or SFO are fully utilized by other airlines, we may be unable to increase our operations at such airport. Additionally, under our LAX and SFO leases, each airport has reserved the right to reevaluate the airlines\u2019 collective utilization of the airport facilities, and to impose minimum usage standards on the airlines in order for each airline to maintain preferential gates. If we are unable to meet future minimum usage standards, we may lose access to our\npreferential gates. If we are unable to increase flights in these and other key markets, if any events cause a reduction in demand for air transportation in these key markets, if increases in competition cause us to reduce fares in these key markets, or if we lose access to our preferential gates, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nOur quarterly results of operations fluctuate due to a number of factors, including seasonality.\nWe expect our quarterly results of operations to continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors, including actions by our competitors, price changes in aircraft fuel and the timing and amount of maintenance expenses. As a result of these and other factors, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, seasonality may cause our quarterly results of operations to fluctuate since passengers tend to fly more during the summer months and less in the winter months. We cannot assure you that we will find profitable markets in which to operate during the winter season. Lower demand for air travel during the winter months may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe have a significant amount of fixed obligations.\nThe airline business is capital intensive, and many airlines, including us, are highly leveraged. We currently lease all of our aircraft, and these leases contain provisions requiring the payment of monthly rent regardless of usage. As of December 31, 2014, we had undiscounted future operating lease obligations of approximately $1.5 billion, as well as significant maintenance reserve requirements associated with these leases that are variable in nature. In addition, we have ordered aircraft and spare engines from Airbus and CFM for delivery over the next eight years. Under those agreements, we are obligated to make pre-delivery payments to Airbus and CFM on regular intervals in advance of the delivery of our ordered aircraft and spare engines. Moreover, we expect to incur additional fixed expenses as we take delivery of new aircraft, with ten aircraft scheduled for delivery between July 2015 and June 2016 and 30 aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2020 through 2022 but that can be canceled by forfeiting amounts on deposit with Airbus.\nThe amount of our current and expected future fixed obligations could strain our cash flows from operations, reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete. Our substantial fixed obligations could reduce our credit, which would negatively impact our ability to obtain additional financing and could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources or more favorable terms. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations or from capital market activities to pay our debt and other fixed obligations as they become due or that we will be able to finance these obligations on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows for any reason, we may be unable to meet our fixed obligations, and our business may be materially adversely affected. In particular, if we are unable to make our required aircraft lease rental payments, we could lose access to one or more aircraft and forfeit our rent deposits, and our lessors could exercise their remedies under the lease agreements. Also, an event of default under any of our leases and our debt financing agreements could trigger cross-default provisions under other agreements.\nOur credit card processors have the right to impose larger holdbacks which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMost of our tickets are sold to customers using credit cards as the form of payment. Our credit card processors have rights in their agreements to hold back receivable monies related to tickets sold for future travel services (i.e., a \u201choldback\u201d). Any related holdback is remitted to us shortly after the customer travels. Holdbacks are commonly imposed on newer or less creditworthy airlines. Prior to our IPO, we had significant holdback requirements with our two primary credit card processors, Elavon Inc. for Visa/MasterCard and American Express. In connection with the IPO, the Virgin Group obtained a $100.0 million letter of credit on our behalf\nwhich was issued to our credit card processors in order to release $100.0 million of our credit card holdbacks. We had no amounts in excess of the letter of credit held back as of December 31, 2014. Outstanding receivable at December 31, 2014 was $9.6 million. If a credit card processor determines there is a material risk with respect to our business or liquidity, it has the right to increase the amount or duration of the holdback. Any increase in the amount or duration of our holdbacks may negatively impact our liquidity and materially adversely affect our business.\nSignificant flight delays, cancellations or aircraft unavailability may materially adversely affect our business.\nVarious factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as air traffic congestion at airports, other air traffic control problems, security requirements, unscheduled maintenance and adverse weather conditions, can cause flight delays or cancellations or cause certain of our aircraft to be unavailable for a period of time. SFO, one of our two primary focus airports, is particularly vulnerable to air traffic constraints and other delays due to fog and inclement weather. Factors that cause flight delays frustrate passengers, and reduced aircraft availability could lead to customer dissatisfaction that harms our reputation. Additionally, if we are forced to cancel a flight due to an event within our control, we will be liable to re-accommodate our guests, including by purchasing tickets for them on other airlines. If one or more of our aircraft is unavailable to fly revenue service for any amount of time, our capacity will be reduced. Significant flight delays, cancellations or aircraft unavailability for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur maintenance costs will increase as our fleet ages.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the average age of aircraft in our fleet of Airbus A320-family aircraft was 5.8 years. Our aircraft will require more scheduled and unscheduled maintenance as they age. We are beginning to incur substantial costs for major maintenance visits for our aircraft, and because of the pattern of our historical fleet growth, we expect to have several aircraft undergoing major maintenance at roughly the same time. These more significant maintenance activities result in out-of-service periods during which certain of our aircraft are unavailable to fly passengers. Any significant increase in maintenance and repair expenses, as well as resulting out-of-service periods, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe expect that costs associated with the final qualifying major engine maintenance events for our aircraft will be amortized over the remaining lease term rather than until the next estimated major maintenance event, because we account for major maintenance under the deferral method. This could result in significantly higher depreciation and amortization expense related to major maintenance in the last few years of the leases as compared to the expenses in earlier periods.\nIn addition, the terms of our lease agreements require us to pay supplemental rent, also known as maintenance reserves, to our lessor in advance of the performance of major maintenance, resulting in our recording significant aircraft maintenance deposits on our consolidated balance sheet. However, the payments made after the final qualifying major engine maintenance event during the lease term are generally fully expensed, as the majority of these amounts are not reimbursable from the lessor. As such, it will result in both additional rent expense and depreciation and amortization expense for previously capitalized maintenance being recorded in the period after the final qualifying major engine maintenance event and just prior to the termination of the lease.\nWe depend on sole-source suppliers for our aircraft and engines.\nA critical cost-saving element of our business strategy is to operate a single-family aircraft fleet; however, our dependence on the Airbus A320-family aircraft and CFM engines for all of our flights makes us more vulnerable to any design defects or mechanical problems associated with this aircraft type or these engines. In the event of any actual or suspected design defects or mechanical problems with the Airbus A320-family aircraft or CFM engines, whether involving our aircraft or that of another airline, we may choose or be required to suspend\nor restrict the use of our aircraft. Our business could also be materially adversely affected if the public avoids flying on our aircraft due to an adverse perception of the Airbus A320-family aircraft or CFM engines, whether because of safety concerns or other problems, real or perceived, or in the event of an accident involving such aircraft or engines. Separately, if Airbus or CFM becomes unable to perform its contractual obligations and we must lease or purchase aircraft from another supplier, we would incur substantial transition costs, including expenses related to acquiring new aircraft, engines, spare parts, maintenance facilities and training activities, and we would lose the cost benefits from our current single-fleet composition, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on third-party service providers to perform functions integral to our operations.\nWe depend on third-party service providers to provide the majority of the services required for our operations, including fueling, maintenance, catering, passenger handling, reservations and airport ground handling, as well as certain administrative and support services. We are likely to enter into similar service agreements for new markets we enter, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary services at acceptable rates. Moreover, although we do enter into agreements with many of our third-party service providers that define expected service performance, we do not directly control these third-party service providers. Any of these third-party service providers may fail to meet their service performance commitments to us, suffer disruptions to their systems that could negatively impact their services or fail to perform their services reliably, professionally or at the high standard of quality that we expect. Any such failure of our third-party service providers may prevent us from operating one or more flights or providing other services to our customers and may materially adversely affect our business. In addition, our business could be materially adversely affected if our customers believe that our services are unreliable or unsatisfactory.\nOur business could be affected by severe weather conditions, natural disasters or the outbreak of contagious disease, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur operations may be materially adversely affected by factors beyond our control, including severe weather conditions, natural disasters and the outbreak of disease. Severe weather conditions, such as winter snowstorms, hurricanes or other weather events, can cause flight cancellations, turbulence or significant delays that may result in increased costs and reduced revenue. Also, our two focus cities, Los Angeles and San Francisco, and our headquarters in Burlingame, California, are located on or near active seismic faults, and an earthquake could occur at any time, which could disrupt our operations at those locations. Similarly, outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, such as avian flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1 (swine) flu and the Ebola virus could significantly reduce demand for passenger traffic and result in travel restrictions. Any interruption in our ability to operate flights or reduction in airline passenger demand because of such events could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIncreases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may materially adversely affect our business.\nIf any of our aircraft were to be involved in an accident or if our property or operations were to be affected by a significant natural catastrophe or other event, we could be exposed to significant liability or loss. If we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance (including aviation hull and liability insurance and property and business interruption coverage) to cover such liabilities or losses, whether due to insurance market conditions or otherwise, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe currently obtain third-party war risk (terrorism) insurance, which is a separate policy from our commercial aviation hull and liability policy, from private insurance companies. Our current war risk insurance from commercial underwriters excludes NBCR (nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological) events. If we are unable to obtain adequate third-party war risk (terrorism) insurance or if a NBCR attack were to take place, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nSecurity breaches involving a compromise of customer information or personal data could expose us to liability, damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to laws relating to privacy of personal data. In the processing of our customer transactions and as part of our ordinary business operations, we and certain of our third-party service providers collect, process, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information, including financial data such as credit card information. The security of the systems and network where we and our service providers store this data is a critical element of our business. Any security breach in which employee or customer data is improperly released or disclosed could result in the loss, disclosure or improper use of this data and subject us to regulatory penalties and litigation, disrupt our operation, damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our business. Additionally, any material failure by us or our service providers to maintain compliance with the Payment Card Industry security requirements or rectify a data security issue may result in fines and restrictions on our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected if we lose the services of our key personnel.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our officers, senior management team and key operating personnel. Competition for highly qualified personnel is intense, and a substantial turnover in key employees without adequate replacement or the inability to attract new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nConcentrated ownership by our principal stockholders could materially adversely affect our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Virgin Group and Cyrus Holdings own approximately 16.0% (which does not include the Virgin Group\u2019s non-voting common stock) and 24.4% of our outstanding common stock, respectively. This concentrated ownership may limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters; as a result, these stockholders may cause us to take actions that our other stockholders do not view as beneficial. For example, this concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their common stock.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members or executive officers.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, related rules implemented or to be implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and the listing rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. These laws and regulations could also make it more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or our board committees or as our executive officers and may divert management\u2019s attention. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, our common stock could be delisted, and we could be subject to fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nWe will be required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis, and any future adverse findings from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports, result in significant expenses to remediate any internal control deficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2015, our management will be required to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. We are currently in the process of reviewing, documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting. We may encounter problems or delays in completing the implementation of any changes necessary to make a favorable assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. In connection with the attestation process by our independent registered public accounting firm, we may encounter problems or delays in implementing any requested improvements and receiving a favorable attestation. In addition, if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, we will not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404. If we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer material misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from the NASDAQ Global Select Market, regulatory investigations, civil or criminal sanctions and litigation, any of which would materially adversely affect our business.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in our stock to decline.\nWe completed our initial public offering in November 2014. Prior to that offering, there was no public market for shares of our common stock, and an active public market for our shares may not be sustained. In addition, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning our competitors, the airline industry or the economy in general;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nmedia reports and publications about the safety of our aircraft or the aircraft type we operate;\n\u2022\nnew regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;\n\u2022\nchanges in the price of aircraft fuel;\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning the availability of the type of aircraft we use;\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts or failure to meet analysts\u2019 performance expectations;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock or other actions by investors with significant shareholdings, including sales by our principal stockholders;\n\u2022\ntrading strategies related to changes in fuel or oil prices; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market, political and other economic conditions.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the past, stockholders have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Any similar litigation against us could result in substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and materially adversely affect our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or publish negative reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities and industry analysts may publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which may cause the trading price of our common stock and our trading volume to decline.\nOur anti-takeover provisions may delay or prevent a change of control, which could materially adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make it difficult to remove our board of directors and management and may discourage or delay \u201cchange of control\u201d transactions, which could materially adversely affect the price of our common stock. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022\nour board of directors is divided into three staggered classes, with each class serving a three-year term, which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new board of directors at a single annual meeting;\n\u2022\nactions to be taken by our stockholders may only be effected at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nspecial meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the Chairman of the Board, our chief executive officer or our president;\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors and propose matters to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company; and\n\u2022\nour board of directors may, without stockholder approval, issue series of preferred stock, or rights to acquire preferred stock, that could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, holders of our common stock or could also be used as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control.\nThe value of our common stock may be materially adversely affected by additional issuances of common stock or preferred stock by us or sales by our principal stockholders.\nAny future issuances or sales of our common stock by us will be dilutive to our existing common stockholders. Cyrus Holdings and the Virgin Group collectively hold approximately 17,399,966 shares of our voting common stock, or 48.0% of our voting common stock outstanding, and 56.2% of the total outstanding equity interests in our company as of December 31, 2014 (which includes 6,852,738 shares of non-voting common stock held by the Virgin Group), and Cyrus Capital and the Virgin Group are entitled to rights with respect to registration of such shares under the Securities Act. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public or private market, a perception in the market that such sales could occur, or the issuance or exercise of securities exercisable or convertible into our common stock, including warrants to purchase our common stock, could materially adversely affect the prevailing price of our common stock.\nOur corporate charter and bylaws include provisions limiting voting and ownership by non-U.S. citizens and specifying an exclusive forum for stockholder disputes.\nTo comply with restrictions imposed by federal law on foreign ownership of U.S. airlines, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws restrict voting of shares of our common stock by non-U.S. citizens. The restrictions imposed by federal law currently require that no more than 24.9% of our stock be voted, directly or indirectly, by persons who are not U.S. citizens, that no more than 49.9% of our outstanding stock be owned (beneficially or of record) by persons who are not U.S. citizens and that our president and at least two-thirds of the members of our board of directors and senior management be U.S. citizens. Our amended and restated bylaws provide that the failure of non-U.S. citizens to register their shares on a separate stock record, which we refer to as the \u201cforeign stock record,\u201d would result in a suspension of their voting rights in the event that the aggregate foreign ownership of the outstanding common stock exceeds the foreign ownership restrictions imposed by federal law. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that any transfer or issuance of our stock that would cause the amount of our stock owned by persons who are not U.S. citizens to exceed foreign ownership restrictions imposed by federal law will be void and of no effect.\nOur amended and restated bylaws further provide that no shares of our common stock will be registered on the foreign stock record if the amount so registered would exceed the foreign ownership restrictions imposed by federal law. If it is determined that the amount registered in the foreign stock record exceeds the foreign ownership restrictions imposed by federal law, shares will be removed from the foreign stock record in reverse chronological order based on the date of registration therein, until the number of shares registered therein does not exceed the foreign ownership restrictions imposed by federal law. We are currently in compliance with these ownership restrictions.\nAs of January 2, 2015, non-U.S. citizens own, in the aggregate, 7,215,503 shares of voting common stock (representing approximately 19.9% of the total voting rights and approximately 16.7% of the total outstanding equity interests in our company).\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or otherwise wrongdoing by, any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws; (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or the bylaws; or (v) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Accordingly, you may be limited in your ability to pursue legal actions.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the further development and expansion of our business and do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, restrictions contained in current or future financing instruments, business prospects and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.\nWe may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including patent, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and\nproceedings. In particular, in recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States and abroad involving patents and other intellectual property rights. We have in the past faced, and may face in the future, claims by third parties that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, cause us to incur significant expenses or liability and/or require us to change our business practices. Because of the potential risks, expenses and uncertainties of litigation, we may, from time to time, settle disputes, even where we believe that we have meritorious claims or defenses. Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, we cannot assure you that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks associated with our presence in international emerging markets, including political or economic instability, and failure to adequately comply with existing legal requirements, may materially adversely affect us.\nCountries with less developed economies, legal systems, financial markets and business and political environments are vulnerable to economic and political problems, such as significant fluctuations in gross domestic product, interest and currency exchange rates, civil disturbances, government instability, nationalization and expropriation of private assets, trafficking and the imposition of taxes or other charges by governments. The occurrence of any of these events in markets served by us now or in the future and the resulting instability may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe emphasize legal compliance and have implemented and continue to implement and refresh policies, procedures and certain ongoing training of our teammates with regard to business ethics and many key legal requirements; however, we cannot assure you that our teammates will adhere to our code of business ethics, other policies or other legal requirements. If we fail to enforce our policies and procedures properly or maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to record our transactions accurately, we may be subject to sanctions. In the event we believe or have reason to believe our teammates have or may have violated applicable laws or regulations, we may incur investigation costs, potential penalties and other related costs which in turn may materially adversely affect our reputation and business.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe incurred significant cumulative net taxable losses through 2014. Our unused losses generally carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. We may be unable to use these losses to offset income before such unused losses expire. In addition, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50-percentage-point cumulative change in the equity ownership of certain stockholders over a rolling three-year period) under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) and other pre-change tax attributes to offset future taxable income or taxes may be limited. We have experienced ownership changes in the past and in connection with our IPO and 2014 Recapitalization that could limit our ability to use pre-change NOLs in the future or limit the amount of NOLs that can offset future taxable income on an annual basis. In addition, we may experience ownership changes as a result of future changes in our stock ownership (some of which changes may not be within our control), including due to sales of our common stock by Cyrus Capital or the Virgin Group. This, in turn, could materially reduce or eliminate our ability to use our losses or tax attributes to offset future taxable income or tax and have an adverse effect on our future cash flows.", "PERMNO": 15088, "SIC": 4512, "TIC": "VA"}
