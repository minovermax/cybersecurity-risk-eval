RISK FACTORS\nInvestors should consider carefully the following factors that could cause the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition to be materially adversely affected.\nCorporate Risks\nVectren is a holding company, and its assets consist primarily of investments in its subsidiaries.\nDividends on the Company\u2019s common stock depend on the earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and cash flow of its subsidiaries, principally Utility Holdings and Enterprises, and the distribution or other payment of earnings from those entities to the Company. Should the earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, or cash flow of, or legal requirements applicable to them restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments to the Company, its ability to pay dividends on its common stock could be limited and its stock price could be adversely affected. The Company\u2019s results of operations, future growth, and earnings and dividend goals also will depend on the performance of its subsidiaries. Additionally, certain of the Company\u2019s lending arrangements contain restrictive covenants, including the maintenance of a total debt to total capitalization ratio.\nDeterioration in general economic conditions may have adverse impacts.\nEconomic conditions may have some negative impact on both gas and electric large customers and wholesale power sales. This impact may include volatility and unpredictability in the demand for natural gas and electricity, tempered growth strategies, significant conservation measures, and perhaps plant closures, production cutbacks, or bankruptcies. Economic conditions may also cause reductions in residential and commercial customer counts and lower revenues. It is also possible that an uncertain economy could affect costs including pension costs, interest costs, and uncollectible accounts expense. Economic declines may be accompanied by a decrease in demand for products and services offered by nonutility operations and therefore lower revenues for those products and services. The economic conditions may have some negative impact on spending for utility and pipeline construction projects, demand for natural gas, and electricity, and spending on performance contracting and renewable energy expansion. It is also possible that unfavorable conditions could lead to reductions in the value of certain nonutility real estate and other legacy investments.\nFinancial market volatility could have adverse impacts.\nThe capital and credit markets may experience volatility and disruption. If market disruption and volatility occurs, there can be no assurance that the Company will not experience adverse effects, which may be material. These effects may include, but are not limited to, difficulties in accessing the short and long-term debt capital markets and the commercial paper market, increased borrowing costs associated with short-term debt obligations, higher interest rates in future financings, and a smaller potential pool of investors and funding sources. Finally, there is no assurance the Company will have access to the equity capital markets to obtain financing when necessary or desirable.\nA downgrade (or negative outlook) in or withdrawal of Vectren\u2019s credit ratings could negatively affect its ability to access capital and its cost.\nThe following table shows the current ratings assigned to the Company and its rated subsidiaries by Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s:\nCurrent Rating\nStandard\nMoody\u2019s\n& Poor\u2019s\nVectren Corporation's corporate credit rating\nnot rated\nA-\nUtility Holdings and Indiana Gas senior unsecured debt\nA2\nA-\nUtility Holdings commercial paper program\nP-1\nA-2\nSIGECO\u2019s senior secured debt\nAa3\nA\nThe current outlook for both Moody's and Standard & Poor\u2019s is stable. Both rating agencies categorize the ratings of the above securities as investment grade. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. The rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s lowest level investment grade rating is BBB- and Baa3, respectively.\nIf the rating agencies downgrade the Company\u2019s credit ratings, particularly below investment grade, or initiate negative outlooks thereon, or withdraw the Company's ratings or, in each case, the ratings of its subsidiaries, it may significantly limit the Company's access to the debt capital markets and the commercial paper market, and the Company\u2019s borrowing costs would increase. In addition, the Company would likely be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings, and its potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease. Finally, there is no assurance that the Company will have access to the equity capital markets to obtain financing when necessary or desirable.\nUtility Operating Risks\nVectren\u2019s gas and electric utility sales are concentrated in the Midwest.\nThe operations of the Company\u2019s regulated utilities are concentrated in central and southern Indiana and west central Ohio and are therefore impacted by changes in the Midwest economy in general and changes in particular industries concentrated in the Midwest. These industries include automotive assembly, parts and accessories; feed, flour and grain processing; metal castings, aluminum products, polycarbonate resin (Lexan\u00ae) and plastic products; gypsum products; electrical equipment, metal specialties, glass and steel finishing; aluminum smelting and recycling; pharmaceutical and nutritional products; gasoline and oil products; ethanol; and coal mining.\nVectren\u2019s regulated utilities operate in an increasingly competitive industry, which may affect its future earnings.\nThe utility industry has been undergoing structural change for several years, resulting in increasing competitive pressure faced by electric and gas utility companies. Increased competition, including those from cogeneration, solar, and other renewables opportunities for customers, may create greater risks to the stability of the Company\u2019s earnings generally and may in the future reduce its earnings from retail electric and gas sales. In this regard, the deployment and commercialization of disruptive technologies, such as renewable energy sources and cogeneration facilities, have the potential to change the nature of the utility industry and reduce demand for the Company\u2019s electric and gas products and services. If the Company is not able to appropriately adapt to structural changes in the utility industry as a result of the development of disruptive technologies, this may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, several states, including Ohio, have passed legislation that allows customers to choose their electricity supplier in a competitive market. Indiana has not enacted such legislation. Ohio regulation also provides for choice of commodity providers for all gas customers. The Company implemented this choice for its gas customers in Ohio and is currently in the second of the three phase process to exit the merchant function in its Ohio service territory. The state of Indiana has not adopted any regulation requiring gas choice in the Company\u2019s Indiana service territories; however, the Company operates under approved tariffs permitting certain industrial and commercial large volume customers to choose their commodity supplier. The Company cannot provide any assurance that increased competition or other changes in legislation, regulation or policies will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA significant portion of Vectren\u2019s electric utility sales are space heating and cooling. Accordingly, its operating results may fluctuate with variability of weather.\nThe Company\u2019s electric utility sales are sensitive to variations in weather conditions. The Company forecasts utility sales on the basis of normal weather. Since the Company does not have a weather-normalization mechanism for its electric operations, significant variations from normal weather could have a material impact on its earnings. However, the impact of weather on the gas operations in the Company\u2019s Indiana territories has been significantly mitigated through the implementation of a normal temperature adjustment mechanism. Additionally, the implementation of a straight fixed variable rate design mitigates most weather variations related to Ohio residential gas sales.\nVectren\u2019s utilities are exposed to increasing regulation, including pipeline safety, environmental, and cybersecurity regulation.\nThe Company's utilities are subject to regulation by federal, state, and local regulatory authorities and are exposed to public policy decisions that may negatively impact the Company's earnings. In particular, the Company is subject to regulation by the FERC, the NERC, the EPA, the IURC, the PUCO, the DOT, Department of Energy (DOE), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). These authorities regulate many aspects of its generation, transmission and distribution operations, including construction and maintenance of facilities, operations, and safety. In addition, the IURC, PUCO, and FERC approve its utility-related debt and equity issuances, regulate the rates that the Company's utilities can charge customers, the rate of return that the Company's utilities are authorized to earn, and their ability to timely recover gas and fuel costs and investments in infrastructure. Further, there are consumer advocates and other parties that may intervene in regulatory proceedings and affect regulatory outcomes.\nTrends Toward Stricter Standards\nWith the trend toward stricter standards, greater regulation, more extensive permit requirements and an increase in the number and types of assets operated that are subject to regulation, the Company's investment in infrastructure, and the associated operating costs have increased and are expected to increase in the future. As examples of the trend toward stricter regulation, the EPA is currently considering revisions to regulations involving fly ash disposal, cooling tower intake facilities, wastewater discharges, and greenhouse gases and continues to implement increasingly more stringent air quality standards.\nPipeline Safety Considerations\nThe Company monitors and maintains its natural gas distribution system to ensure that natural gas is delivered in a safe, efficient, and reliable manner. The Company's natural gas utilities are currently engaged in replacement programs in both Indiana and Ohio, the primary purpose of which is preventive maintenance and continual renewal and improvement. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011 (Pipeline Safety Law) was signed into law on January 3, 2012. While certain of the compliance costs remain uncertain, the Pipeline Safety Law resulted in further investment in pipeline inspections, and where necessary, additional investments in pipeline infrastructure; and therefore, result in both increased levels of operating expenses and capital expenditures associated with the Company's natural gas distribution businesses as evidenced by recent regulatory filings and resulting Commission Orders in Indiana and Ohio by Indiana Gas, SIGECO, and VEDO.\nEnvironmental Considerations\nThe Company's utility operations and properties are subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal, state and municipal laws and regulations. These environmental regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities, and obligations in connection with the storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of hazardous substances and limit airborne emissions from electric generating facilities, including particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOX), mercury, and non-hazardous substances such as coal combustion residuals, among others. Environmental legislation/regulation also requires that facilities, sites, and other properties associated with the Company's operations be operated, maintained, abandoned, and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. The Company's current costs to comply with these laws and regulations are significant to its results of operations and financial condition.\nClimate Change and Renewable Energy Considerations\nOn June 2, 2014, the EPA proposed its rule for states to regulate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from existing electric generating units. The rule, when final will require states to adopt plans that reduce CO2 emissions by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. Despite having just been recently proposed and not expected to be finalized until summer of 2015, legal challenges to the EPA\u2019s proposal have begun. Similarly, in the President's Climate Action Plan on methane emissions released in March of 2014, new actions were outlined to require 40 percent to 45 percent reduction in methane emissions from upstream sources, specifically targeting new and modified oil and natural gas production wells. Downstream sources, such as local distribution companies, will be encouraged to participate in a new voluntary methane emissions monitoring and reduction program. If these regulations are finalized by the EPA, or if legislation requiring reductions in CO2 and other GHGs or legislation mandating a renewable energy portfolio standard is adopted, such regulation could substantially affect both the costs and operating characteristics of the Company\u2019s fossil fuel generating plants and natural gas distribution businesses. A preliminary investigation demonstrated costs to comply would be significant, first with regard to operating expenses and later for capital\nexpenditures as technology becomes available to control greenhouse gas emissions. However, these compliance cost estimates are based on highly uncertain assumptions, including allowance prices if a cap and trade approach were employed, and energy efficiency targets. At this time and in the absence of final legislation or regulatory mandates, compliance costs and other effects associated with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions or obtaining renewable energy sources remain uncertain.\nEvolving Physical Security and Cybersecurity Standards and Considerations\nThe frequency, size and variety of physical security and cybersecurity threats against critical infrastructure companies continues to grow, as do the evolving frameworks, standards and regulations intended to keep pace with and address these threats. In 2013 and 2014, there was a marked increase in interest from both federal and state regulatory agencies related to physical security and cybersecurity in general, and specifically in critical infrastructure sectors, including the electric and natural gas sectors. The Company has dedicated internal and third party physical security and cybersecurity teams and maintains vigilance with regard to the communication and assessment of physical security and cybersecurity risks and the measures employed to protect information technology assets, critical infrastructure, the Company and its customers from these threats. Physical security and cybersecurity threats, however, constantly evolve in attempts to identify and capitalize on any weakness or unprotected areas. If these measures were to fail or if a breach were to occur, it could result in impairment or loss of critical functions, operating reliability, customer or other confidential information. The ultimate effects which are difficult to quantify with any certainty are partially limited through insurance.\nIncreasing regulation and infrastructure replacement programs could affect Vectren's utility rates charged to customers, its costs, and its profitability.\nAny additional expenses or capital incurred by the Company's utilities, as it relates to complying with increasing regulation and other infrastructure replacement activities are expected to be recovered from customers in its service territories through increased rates. Increased rates have an impact on the economic health of the communities served. New regulations could also negatively impact industries in the Company's service territory, including industries in which the Company operates.\nThe Company's utilities' ability to obtain rate increases and to maintain current authorized rates of return depends in part upon regulatory discretion, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain rate increases or rate supplements or earn currently authorized rates of return. Both Indiana and Ohio have passed laws allowing utilities to recover at least some of the costs of complying with federal mandates or other infrastructure replacement expenditures, and in Ohio other capital investments, outside of a base rate proceeding. However, these activities may have at least a short-term adverse impact on the Company's cash flow and financial condition.\nIn addition, failure to comply with new or existing laws and regulations may result in fines, penalties, or injunctive measures and may not be recoverable from customers and could result in a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nVectren's regulated energy delivery operations are subject to various risks.\nA variety of hazards and operations risks, such as leaks, accidental explosions, and mechanical problems, are inherent in the Company\u2019s gas and electric distribution activities. If such events occur, they could cause substantial financial losses and result in injury to or loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, and impairment of operations. The location of pipelines, storage facilities, and the electric grid near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. These activities may subject the Company to litigation or administrative proceedings from time to time. Such litigation or proceedings could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, or penalties or be resolved on unfavorable terms. In accordance with customary industry practices, the Company maintains insurance against a significant portion, but not all, of these risks and losses. To the extent that the occurrence of any of these events is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nVectren\u2019s regulated power supply operations are subject to various risks.\nThe Company\u2019s electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased purchase power costs. Such operational risks can arise from circumstances such as facility shutdowns due to equipment failure or operator error; interruption of fuel supply or increased prices of fuel as contracts expire; disruptions in the delivery of electricity; inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements; labor disputes; and natural disasters.\nThe Company participates in the MISO.\nThe Company is a member of the MISO, which serves the electric transmission needs of much of the Midcontinent region and maintains operational control over the Company\u2019s electric transmission facilities, as well as that of other utilities in the region. As a result of such control, the Company\u2019s continued ability to import power, when necessary, and export power to the wholesale market has been, and may continue to be, impacted.\nThe need to expend capital for improvements to the regional electric transmission system, both to the Company\u2019s facilities as well as to those facilities of adjacent utilities, over the next several years is expected to be significant. The Company timely recovers its investment in certain new electric transmission projects that benefit the MISO infrastructure at a FERC approved rate of return, which is currently under review based on a joint complaint filed against MISO and various MISO transmission owners, including the Company. The FERC has yet to rule on the case and the Company is currently unable to predict the outcome of the proceeding.\nAlso, the MISO allocates operating costs and the cost of multi-value projects throughout the region to its participating utilities such as the Company\u2019s regulated electric utility, and such costs are significant. Adjustments to these operating costs, including adjustments that result from participants entering or leaving the MISO, could cause increases or decreases to customer bills. The Company timely recovers its portion of MISO operating expenses as tracked costs.\nWholesale power marketing activities may add volatility to earnings.\nThe Company\u2019s regulated electric utility engages in wholesale power marketing activities that primarily involve the offering of utility-owned or contracted generation into the MISO hourly and real time markets. As part of these strategies, the Company may also execute energy contracts that are integrated with portfolio requirements around power supply and delivery. Presently, margin earned from these activities above or below $7.5 million per year is shared evenly with customers. These earnings from wholesale marketing activities may vary based on fluctuating prices for electricity and the amount of electric generating capacity or purchased power available beyond that needed to meet firm service requirements. In addition, this earnings sharing approach may be modified in future regulatory proceedings.\nVolatility in the wholesale price of natural gas, coal, and electricity could reduce earnings and working capital.\nThe Company\u2019s regulated operations have limited exposure to commodity price risk for transactions involving purchases and sales of natural gas, coal, and purchased power for the benefit of retail customers due to current state regulations, which, subject to compliance with those regulations, allow for recovery of the cost of such purchases through natural gas and fuel cost adjustment mechanisms. However, significant volatility in the price of natural gas, coal, or purchased power may cause existing customers to conserve or motivate them to switch to alternate sources of energy as well as cause new home developers, builders, and new customers to select alternative sources of energy. Decreases in volumes sold could reduce earnings. The decrease would be more significant in the absence of constructive regulatory orders, such as those authorizing revenue decoupling, lost margin recovery, and other innovative rate designs. A decline in new customers could impede growth in future earnings. In addition, during periods when commodity prices are higher than historical levels, working capital costs could increase due to higher carrying costs of inventories and cost recovery mechanisms, and customers may have trouble paying higher bills leading to increased bad debt expenses. Additionally, significant oil price fluctuations and their economic impact on the ability to continue shale gas drilling may impact the prices of natural gas and purchased power.\nIncreased conservation efforts and technology advances, which result in improved energy efficiency or the development of alternative energy sources, may result in reduced demand for the Company\u2019s energy products and services.\nThe trend toward increased conservation and technological advances, including installation of improved insulation and the development of more efficient furnaces and air conditioners and other heating and cooling devices as well as lighting, may reduce the demand for energy products. Prices for natural gas are subject to volatile fluctuations in response to changes in supply and other market conditions. During periods of high energy commodity costs, the Company's prices generally increase, which may lead to customer conservation. State and/or federal regulation may require mandatory conservation measures, which would reduce the demand for energy products. In addition, the Company's customers, especially large commercial and industrial customers, may choose to employ various technological advances to develop alternative energy sources, such as the construction and development of wind power, solar technology, or electric cogeneration facilities. Increased conservation efforts and the utilization of technological advances to increase energy efficiency or to develop alternate energy sources could lead to a reduction in demand for the Company\u2019s energy products and services, which could have an adverse effect on its revenues and overall results of operations.\nNonutility Operating Risks\nThe performance of Vectren\u2019s nonutility businesses is subject to certain risks.\nExecution of the Company\u2019s nonutility business strategies and the success of efforts to invest in and develop new opportunities in the nonutility business area are subject to a number of risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, the effects of weather; changes in market prices for various forms of energy; failure of installed performance contracting products to operate as planned; failure to properly estimate the cost to construct projects; loss of key management and knowledge-based employees; potential legislation or regulations that may limit CO2 and other greenhouse gases emissions; operating accidents that may require environmental remediation; failure to properly construct pipeline infrastructure; creditworthiness of customers and joint venture partners; changes in federal, state or local legal and regulatory requirements, such as changes in tax laws or rates; environmental or cybersecurity regulations, and changing market conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s nonutility businesses support its regulated utilities pursuant to service contracts by providing infrastructure services. In most instances, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain these service contracts depends upon regulatory discretion, and there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain future service contracts, or that existing arrangements will not be revisited.\nNonutility infrastructure services operations could be adversely affected by a number of factors.\nInfrastructure Services results are dependent on a number of factors. The industry is competitive and many of the contracts are subject to a bidding process. Should Infrastructure Services be unsuccessful in bidding contracts, results of operations could be impacted. Infrastructure Services enters into a variety of contracts, some of which are fixed price. Through competitive bidding, the volume of contracted work could vary significantly from year to year. Further, to the extent there are unanticipated cost increases in completion of the contracted work, the profit margin realized on any single project could be reduced. Additionally, Infrastructure Services contributes to several multiemployer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements with unions representing employees covered by those agreements. A significant increase to the funding requirements could adversely impact financial condition, results of operations, and/or cash flows. Changes in legislation and regulations impacting the industries in which the customers served by Infrastructure Services operate could impact operating results. Other risks include, but are not limited to: the effects of weather; failure to properly estimate the cost to construct projects; the inability to attract and retain qualified employees; cancellation of projects by customers and/or reductions in the scope of the projects; credit worthiness of customers; inability to obtain materials and equipment required to perform services from suppliers and manufacturers; and changing market conditions, including changes in the market prices of oil and natural gas that would affect the demand for infrastructure construction.\nNonutility energy services operations could be adversely affected by a number of factors.\nEnergy Services results are dependent on a number of factors. The industry is competitive and many of the contracts are subject to a bidding process. Should Energy Services be unsuccessful in bidding contracts, results of operations could be impacted. Through competitive bidding, the volume of contracted work could vary significantly from year to year. Further, to the extent there are unanticipated cost increases in completion of the contracted work, the profit margin realized on any single project could be reduced. Changes in legislation and regulations impacting the industries in which the customers served by Energy Services operate could impact operating results. Other risks include, but are not limited to: failure to properly estimate the cost to construct projects; the inability to attract and retain qualified employees; risks associated with projects owned or operated; cancellation of projects by customers and/or reductions in the scope of the projects; credit worthiness of customers; and changing market conditions.\nOther Corporate Operating Risks\nThe Company is exposed to physical and financial risks related to the uncertainty of climate change.\nA changing climate creates uncertainty and could result in broad changes to the Company\u2019s service territories. These impacts could include, but are not limited to, population shifts; changes in the level of annual rainfall; changes in the weather; and changes to the frequency and severity of weather events such as thunderstorms, wind, tornadoes, and ice storms that can damage infrastructure. Such changes could impact the Company in a number of ways including the number and/or type of customers in the Company\u2019s service territories; the demand for energy resulting in the need for additional investment in generation assets or the need to retire current infrastructure that is no longer required; an increase to the cost of providing service; and an increase in the likelihood of capital expenditures to replace damaged infrastructure.\nTo the extent climate change impacts a region\u2019s economic health, it may also impact the Company\u2019s revenues, costs, and capital structure and thus the need for changes to rates charged to regulated customers. Rate changes themselves can impact the economic health of the communities served and may in turn adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nIncreased derivatives regulations could impact results.\nThe Company uses commodity derivative instruments in conjunction with procurement activities. The Company may also periodically use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with anticipated debt issuances.\nRegulations related to the use of derivatives that became law in 2010 under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act continue to evolve and their ultimate application remains uncertain. Depending on the continued evolution of the regulations adopted by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and other agencies, the Company may be required to post additional collateral with dealer counterparties for commitments and interest rates, physical or financial commodity derivative transactions and report or otherwise disclose such activity to dealer counterparties or other agencies. The law provides for an exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end-users. Requirements to post collateral could limit cash for investment and for other corporate purposes or could increase debt levels and resulting interest expense. In addition, a requirement for counterparties to post collateral could result in additional costs associated with executing transactions, thereby decreasing profitability. An increased collateral requirement could also reduce the Company\u2019s ability to execute derivative transactions to reduce commodity price and interest rate uncertainty and to protect cash flows. The regulations may also limit the pool of potential counterparties and/or the liquidity in the respective markets for such transactions.\nSignificant rule-making by numerous governmental agencies, particularly the CFTC, continues to evolve and has been subject to a number of extensions and delays. The Company continues to evaluate the impacts of these rulemakings and interpretations as they become available.\nVectren\u2019s subsidiaries have performance and warranty obligations, some of which are guaranteed by Vectren.\nIn the normal course of business, subsidiaries of the Company issue performance bonds and other forms of assurance that commit them to timely install infrastructure, operate facilities, pay vendors or subcontractors, and/or support warranty obligations. Vectren Corporation, as the parent company, will from time to time guarantee its subsidiaries\u2019 commitments. These guarantees do not represent incremental consolidated obligations; rather, they represent parental guarantees of subsidiary obligations in order to allow those subsidiaries the flexibility to conduct business without posting other forms of collateral. The Company has not been called upon to satisfy any obligations pursuant to these parental guarantees.\nCertain of Vectren's nonutility operations face a customer concentration risk. The loss of such a customer would result in a decline in revenue and could have an adverse effect on the results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, revenues and total outstanding receivables from one customer of Infrastructure Services can individually account for more than 5 percent of the Company's consolidated operating revenues and receivables, respectively. While the Company believes that the loss of any one customer would not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations, the loss of a customer of this significance or a significant decline in related customer revenues could have an adverse effect on the results of operations and cash flows of Infrastructure Services.\nFrom time to time, Vectren is subject to material litigation and regulatory proceedings.\nFrom time to time, the Company may be subject to material litigation and regulatory proceedings, including matters involving compliance with federal and state laws, regulations or other matters. There can be no assurance that the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, corporate reputation, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThe investment performance of pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could impact Vectren\u2019s liquidity and results of operations.\nThe costs associated with the Company sponsored retirement plans, including certain multiemployer plans at Infrastructure Services, are dependent on a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets; discount rates; the level of interest rates used to measure funding levels; changes in actuarial assumptions; future government regulations; changes in plan design, and Company contributions. In addition, the Company could be required to provide for significant funding of these defined benefit pension plans. Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on liquidity by reducing cash flows for other purposes and could negatively affect results of operations.\nCatastrophic events, such as terrorist, acts of war, and acts of God, may adversely affect Vectren\u2019s facilities and operations and corporate reputation.\nCatastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, ice storms, tornadoes, terrorist acts, cyber attacks or similar occurrences could adversely affect the Company\u2019s facilities, operations, corporate reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Either a direct act against Company-owned generating facilities or transmission and distribution infrastructure or an act against the infrastructure of neighboring utilities or interstate pipelines that are used by the Company to transport power and natural gas could result in the Company being unable to deliver natural gas or electricity for a prolonged period. In the event of a severe disruption resulting from such events, the Company has contingency plans and employs crisis management to respond and recover operations. Despite these measures, if such an occurrence were to occur, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nCyber attacks or similar occurrences may adversely affect Vectren's facilities, operations, corporate reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company relies on information technology networks and systems to operate its generating facilities, engage in asset management activities, and process, transmit and store electronic information including customer and employee information. Security breaches of this information technology infrastructure could lead to system disruptions, generating facility shutdowns or\nunauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In particular, any data loss or information security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use or disclosure of sensitive or classified information could result in claims, remediation costs, regulatory sanctions against the Company, loss of current and future contracts, and serious harm to the Company's reputation. While the Company has implemented policies, procedures, and controls to prevent and detect these activities, not all misconduct may be prevented. In the event of a severe infrastructure system disruption or generating facility shutdown resulting from such events, the Company has contingency plans and employs crisis management to respond and recover operations. Despite these measures, if such an attack or security breach were to occur, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The ultimate effects, which are difficult to quantify with any certainty, are partially limited through insurance.\nWorkforce risks could affect Vectren\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company is subject to various workforce risks, including but not limited to, the risk that it will be unable to attract and retain qualified and diverse personnel; that it will be unable to effectively transfer the knowledge and expertise of an aging workforce to new personnel as those workers retire; that it will be unable to react to a pandemic illness; an overall migration to more defined contribution and high deductible employee benefit packages; and that it will be unable to reach collective bargaining arrangements with the unions that represent certain of its workers, which could result in work stoppages.\nVectren\u2019s ability to effectively manage its third party contractors, agents, and business partners could have a significant impact on our business and reputation.\nThe Company relies on third party contractors and other agents and business partners to perform some of the services provided to its customers, as well as to handle physical security and cybersecurity functions. Any misconduct by these third parties, or the Company\u2019s inability to properly manage them, could adversely impact the provision of services to customers and the quality of services provided. Misconduct could include fraud or other improper activities, such as falsifying records and violations of laws. Other examples could include the failure to comply with the Company\u2019s policies and procedures or with government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the use and safeguarding of classified or other protected information, legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, laws and regulations relating to environmental, health or safety matters, bribery of foreign government officials, import-export control, lobbying or similar activities, and any other applicable laws or regulations. Any data loss or information security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use or disclosure of sensitive or classified information could result in claims, remediation costs, regulatory sanctions against the Company, loss of current and future contracts, and serious harm to its reputation. Although the Company has implemented policies, procedures, and controls to prevent and detect these activities, these precautions may not prevent all misconduct, and as a result, the Company could face unknown risks or losses. The Company's failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or misconduct by any of its contractors, agents, or business partners could damage its reputation and subject it to fines and penalties, restitution or other damages, loss of current and future customer contracts and suspension or debarment from contracting with federal, state or local government agencies, any of which would adversely affect the business and future results.", "PERMNO": 51633, "SIC": 4923, "TIC": "VVC"}
