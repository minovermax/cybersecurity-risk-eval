{"cik": "1372183", "company": "Monaker Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-06-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report, readers should carefully consider the following important factors. These factors, among others, in some cases have affected, and in the future could affect, our financial condition and results of operations and could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements that appear in this Annual Report or that we have made or will make elsewhere.\nRisks Related to Our Operations, Business and Industry\nWe need additional capital which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, which raises questions about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs of February 28, 2021, we had $26.0 million in total assets, $6.8 million in total liabilities, working capital of $6.0 million and a total accumulated deficit of $132.3 million. We had net loss of $16,508,654 for the FYE February 28, 2021, compared to net loss of $9,454,686 for the FYE February 29, 2020, an increase in net loss of $7,053,968 from the prior period. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.\nWe are subject to all the substantial risks inherent in the development of a new business enterprise within an extremely competitive industry. Due to the absence of a long-standing operating history and the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete, we anticipate operating losses until we can successfully implement our business strategy, which includes all associated revenue streams. Our revenue model is new and evolving, and we cannot be certain that it will be successful. The potential profitability of this business model is unproven. We may never ever achieve profitable operations or generate significant revenues. Our future operating results depend on many factors, including demand for our products, the level of competition, and the ability of our officers to manage our business and growth. As a result of the emerging nature of the market in which we compete, we may incur operating losses until such time as we can develop a substantial and stable revenue base. Additional development expenses may delay or negatively impact the ability of the Company to generate profits. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that our business model will be successful or that we can sustain revenue growth, achieve, or sustain profitability, or continue as a going concern. Furthermore, due to our relatively small size and market footprint, we may be more susceptible to issues affecting the global travel, cryptocurrency and banking (assuming the IFEB acquisition is successfully completed) industries in general, such as COVID-19, contractions in the global travel industry, cryptocurrency and banking (assuming the IFEB acquisition is successfully completed) regulatory changes, as compared to larger competitors.\nWe currently have a monthly cash requirement of approximately $600,000. We believe that in the aggregate, we could require several millions of dollars to support and expand the marketing and development of our products, repay debt obligations, provide capital expenditures for additional equipment and development costs, payment obligations, office space and systems for managing the business, and cover other operating costs until our planned revenue streams from all products are fully implemented and begin to offset our operating costs. We require additional funding in the future and if we are unable to obtain additional funding on acceptable terms, or at all, it will negatively impact our business, financial condition, and liquidity. As of February 28, 2021, and February 29, 2020, we had $6,825,072 and $4,078,849, respectively, of current liabilities.\nWe have derived our funding of operations with equity transactions and with the proceeds from debt offerings. Currently, revenues provide less than 1% of our cash requirements due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe have experienced liquidity issues due to, among other reasons, our limited ability to raise adequate capital on acceptable terms. We have historically relied upon the sale of common stock and the issuance of promissory notes to fund our operations and have devoted significant efforts to reduce that exposure. We anticipate that we will need to issue equity to fund our operations and continue to repay our outstanding debt for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to achieve operational profitability or are not successful in securing other forms of financing, we will have to evaluate alternative actions to reduce our operating expenses and conserve cash.\nThese conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The financial statements included herein also include a going concern footnote from our auditors.\nIn the event we are unable to raise adequate funding in the future for our operations and to pay our outstanding debt obligations, we may be forced to scale back our business plan and/or liquidate some or all of our assets or may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection, which could result in the value of our outstanding securities declining in value or becoming worthless.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material adverse impact on the travel industry and our business, operating results, and liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and governmental responses thereto, including travel restrictions, \u2018stay-at-home\u2019 orders and required social distancing orders, have severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world, and is having an unprecedented effect on the global travel industry. Additionally, the ability to travel has been curtailed through border closures, mandated travel restrictions and limited operations of hotels and airlines and may be further limited through additional voluntary or mandated closures of travel-related businesses.\nThe measures implemented to contain the COVID-19 pandemic have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant negative effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity position. In particular, such measures have led to unprecedented levels of cancellations and limited new travel bookings in our travel division. Moreover, any additional measures or changes in laws or regulations, whether in the United States or other countries, that further impair the ability or desire of individuals to travel, including laws or regulations banning travel, requiring the closure of hotels or other travel-related businesses (such as restaurants) or otherwise restricting travel due to the risk of the spreading of COVID-19, may exacerbate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity position.\nThe duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic are still uncertain and difficult to predict. The pandemic could continue to impede global economic activity for an extended period, even as restrictions have been lifted in many jurisdictions and vaccines are now widely available in the United States and in many other jurisdictions, leading to decreased per capita income and disposable income, increased and sustained unemployment or a decline in consumer confidence, all of which could significantly reduce discretionary spending by individuals and businesses on travel and may create a recession in the United States or globally. In turn, that could have a negative impact on demand for our services. We also cannot predict the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our partners and their business and operations or the ways that the pandemic may fundamentally alter the travel industry. The aforementioned circumstances could result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, potentially for a prolonged period.\nThe Company\u2019s liquidity could also be adversely impacted by delays in payments of outstanding accounts receivable amounts beyond normal payment terms and insolvencies.\nAlthough we currently cannot predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our fiscal 2022 financial results relating to our operations, we anticipate an increase in year-over-year revenue as compared to fiscal year 2021 ended February 28, 2021. However, the ultimate extent of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on global travel and overall economic activity is constantly changing and impossible to predict currently.\nSeparately, our capital requirements associated with our travel division may increase in the near term and long-term due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting reduced demand for travel services, the increases in cancellations and re-bookings, and the extent to which such pandemic may further impact the ability of our customers to fulfill their payment obligations.\nAs a result of the above, in the event the HotPlay Share Exchange described above under \u201cItem 1. Business-Recent Material Events-HotPlay and Axion Share Exchanges\u201d, does not close timely, if at all, we may be forced to scale back our operations, adjust our plan of operations, borrow or raise additional funding, which may not be available on favorable terms if at all. In the event we require and are unable to raise additional funding in the future, we may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection.\nThe $190,000 owed to us under Secured Convertible Promissory Note due from Bettwork Industries Inc., may not be repaid timely, if at all.\nBettwork Industries Inc. (\u201cBettwork\u201d), a related party owes us $190,000 pursuant to a promissory note (the \u201cBettwork Note\u201d). The Bettwork Note bears interest at 12% per year and was due on February 29, 2020. All interest and the principal balance were due and payable on the maturity date. The Bettwork Note includes a \u201cDefault Rate\u201d of eighteen percent (18.0%) per annum and is secured by all of the outstanding preferred stock shares held by the Chairman of the board of directors of Bettwork (which provide for super-majority voting rights) and Bettwork is precluded from issuing additional shares of common stock or preferred stock without consent from Monaker. Additionally, we have the right to convert the principal and accrued interest owed under the Bettwork Note into common stock of Bettwork at a conversion price of $0.75 per share (as equitably adjusted for stock splits and recapitalizations). The Bettwork Note is in default, Bettwork may never pay the Bettwork Note and we may never collect on amounts owed thereunder.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future and raise needed capital. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic and market conditions and financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Our business may continue to not generate sufficient cash to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditure, debt service and other liquidity needs, which could result in our inability to comply with financial and other covenants contained in our debt agreements, our being unable to repay or pay interest on our indebtedness, and our inability to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to service our debt obligations, fund our other liquidity needs and maintain compliance with our financial and other covenants, we could be forced to curtail our operations, our creditors could accelerate our indebtedness and exercise other remedies and we could be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as selling assets or refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness. However, such alternatives may not be feasible or adequate.\nWe are required to make monthly redemption payments, at the request of Streeterville under the Streeterville Capital, LLC Promissory Notes, and our obligations under the Streeterville Capital, LLC Promissory Notes are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets.\nAs described in greater detail above under \u201cItem 1. Business-Recent Material Events-Streeterville Note Purchases\u201d, we currently have outstanding secured promissory notes due to Streeterville totaling approximately $2.3 million as of February 28, 2021 and approximately $7.2 million as of the date of this Report. From time to time, beginning six months after issuance (i.e., in May 2021), Streeterville may redeem a portion of the November 2020 Streeterville Note, not to exceed $1.25 million. In the event we don\u2019t pay the amount of any requested redemption within three trading days, an amount equal to 25% of such redemption amount is added to the outstanding balance of the November 2020 Streeterville Note. Under certain circumstances, the Company may defer the redemption payments up to three times, for 30 days each, provided that upon each such deferral the outstanding balance of the November 2020 Streeterville Note is increased by 2%. From time to time, beginning six months after issuance (i.e., in August 2021), Streeterville may redeem a portion of the March 2021 Streeterville Note, not to exceed $2.125 million. In the event we don\u2019t pay the amount of any requested redemption within three trading days, an amount equal to 25% of such redemption amount is added to the outstanding balance of the March 2021 Streeterville Note. Under certain circumstances, the Company may defer the redemption payments up to three times, for 30 days each, provided that upon each such deferral the outstanding balance of the March 2021 Streeterville Note is increased by 2%. We may not have the required funds to pay the required note redemptions and such redemptions, or penalties in connection therewith, may have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations, and ability to pay our other debts as they come due. Our failure to pay the redemptions, when due, may result in defaults under our agreements with Streeterville.\nIn connection with the Streeterville Secured Promissory Notes, the Company entered into a Security Agreement with Streeterville (the \u201cSecurity Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which the obligations of the Company are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company. As such, Streeterville may enforce its security interests over our assets and/or our subsidiaries which secure the repayment of such obligations, take control of our assets and operations, force us to seek bankruptcy protection or force us to curtail or abandon our current business plans and operations. If that were to happen, any investment in the Company could become worthless.\nWe are subject to requirements, penalties and damages under our agreements with Streeterville.\nAs described in greater detail above under \u201cItem 1. Business-Recent Material Events-Streeterville Note Purchases\u201d, we have entered into various agreements and promissory notes with Streeterville. In addition to the required redemptions discussed above, we may prepay all or any portion of the outstanding balance of the Streeterville notes at any time subject to a prepayment penalty equal to 10% of the amount of the outstanding balance to be prepaid. For so long as the Streeterville notes remain outstanding, the Company has agreed to pay to Streeterville 20% of the gross proceeds that the Company receives from the sale of any of its common stock or preferred stock, towards each outstanding note, which percentage increases to 30% upon the occurrence of, and continuance of, an event of default under each Streeterville note. Each time that we fail to pay an Equity Payment, the outstanding balance of the applicable Streeterville note automatically increases by 10%. Additionally, in the event we fail to timely pay any such Equity Payment, Streeterville may seek an injunction which would prevent us from issuing common or preferred stock until or unless we pay such Equity Payment. The November 2020 Streeterville Note provided that if any of the following events had not occurred on or before April 30, 2021, the then outstanding balance of the note (including accrued and unpaid interest) increases by an amount equal to 25% of the then-current outstanding balance thereof: (a) HotPlay must have become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; (b) HotPlay must have raised at least $15,000,000 in cash through equity investments; (c) upon consummation of the HotPlay Share Exchange, all outstanding debt owed by the Company to HotPlay must have either been forgiven by HotPlay or converted into the Company\u2019s common stock; (d) HotPlay must have become a co-borrower on the Streeterville note; and (e) the Company must have paid off certain liabilities which have been paid in full. As a result of the HotPlay Share Exchange not closing by April 30, 2021, Streeterville has advised us that we owe approximately an additional $1 million on the November 2020 Streeterville Note (representing 25% of the amount due thereunder as of April 30, 2021), pursuant to the stated terms of such note.\nThe March 2021 Streeterville Note has similar terms as the above as to Equity Payments and requires that if any of the following events have not occurred on or before June 30, 2021, the then outstanding balance of the note (including accrued and unpaid interest) increases by an amount equal to 25% of the then-current outstanding balance thereof: (a) HotPlay must have become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; (b) HotPlay must have raised at least $15,000,000 in cash or debt through equity investments; (c) upon consummation of the HotPlay Share Exchange, all outstanding debt owed by the Company to HotPlay must have either been forgiven by HotPlay or converted into the Company\u2019s common stock; and (d) HotPlay must have become a co-borrower on the March 2021 Streeterville Note.\nOn June 1, 2021, Streeterville agreed to defer 50% of the April 2021 Note Increase which was otherwise to occur due to the Company\u2019s failure to timely meet all of the November 2020 Note Transaction Conditions. As such, a total of $506,085 has been capitalized into the outstanding balance of the November 2020 Streeterville Note effective as of April 30, 2021, and the remaining $506,085 of the April 2021 Note Increase will only be added to the balance of the November 2020 Streeterville Note if the Company fails to meet the November 2020 Transaction Conditions by June 30, 2021. Separately, if the Company does not meet the March 2021 Note Transaction Conditions by June 30, 2021, the March 2021 Streeterville Note will be subject to the June 2021 Note Increase.\nBoth Streeterville notes also include various other penalties, liquidated damages and triggers which increase the amount due, or the amounts of the notes. Our failure to comply with the terms of the Streeterville notes or penalties thereunder, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow, and could result in us having to pay significantly more funds to Streeterville and/or seeking bankruptcy protection.\nAxion owes us a substantial amount of money, the payment of which is in default, and which may not be timely repaid, if at all.\nPursuant to the Axion Share Exchange, which closed on November 16, 2020, the Company acquired $7,657,024 of debt owed by Axion. As of June 30, 2019, the last date that publicly available information for Axion is available, Axion had $2.5 million more liabilities than assets. The Axion debt acquired by the Company pursuant to the November 16, 2020 closing of the Axion Share Exchange is currently past due and has not been paid to date. We may have to take legal action to enforce the repayment of such debt. Furthermore, Axion may not have sufficient cash to repay such debt. The debt is unsecured and as such, secured creditors of Axion may have priority rights to Axion\u2019s assets in connection with any liquidation or bankruptcy. In the event the Axion debt is not paid and/or not paid in full, it could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and our ability to pay our debts as they become due. Any continued failure by Axion to timely repay their debt obligations under the Axion debt acquired pursuant to the Axion Share Exchange could cause the value of our securities to decline in value or become worthless.\nIf we are not able to complete software interfaces with our property owners, managers and distributors, in a timely manner, our business is susceptible to shortfalls in revenues due to delays in remitting our ALRs to distributors and/or ALRs not being available for bookings or distribution.\nThe Company contracts with property owners and managers to list their ALRs on the Company\u2019s system. Those ALRs are being populated into the system through an application programming interface (API) from the property owner and/or manager to the Company. If the technology of the API is inadequate, erroneous or corrupted, the Company may incur delays in populating the ALRs into the Company\u2019s system until the issues related to their API are corrected. These delays could cause delays in realizing revenues from bookings from those additional ALRs.\nAlso, the Company plans to provide its ALRs to distributors who will allow its customers to book those ALRs. The Company plans to make those ALRs available to distributors through its own API. If the technology of the distributor cannot write the correct program to request the ALRs from the Company\u2019s operating system, the Company may incur delays in making the ALRs available to the distributor until the issues are resolved and the correct program is written by the distributor. These delays could cause delays in realizing revenues from bookings from those ALRs.\nOur Shareholders Agreement with the founder of Reinhart provides for certain put rights, which if exercised by such founder, could require us to pay significant amounts of money.\nOn January 15, 2021, we entered into a Shareholders\u2019 Agreement with Jan C. Reinhart, the founder of Reinhart. Such Shareholders\u2019 Agreement allows Mr. Reinhart to put his 49% ownership of Reinhart to us on certain dates from January 2024 to January 2026, as described above under \u201cItem 1. Business-Recent Material Events-Reinhart Interactive TV AG Acquisition\u201d. There is no cap on the required purchase price which would be payable to Mr. Reinhart, and such purchase price may be as high as 15 times EBITDA of Reinhart for the applicable periods. We may need to raise additional funding in the future to pay the put amount, and as such may need to seek additional debt or equity financing. Such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If debt financing is available and obtained, our interest expense may increase and we may be subject to the risk of default, depending on the terms of such financing. If equity financing is available and obtained it may result in our shareholders experiencing significant dilution. If such financing is unavailable, we may be in breach of the terms of the put requirement, which could subject us to litigation, damages and penalties. The existence of the put right could make it harder for us to sell our interest in Reinhart, devalue such interest, or cause complex accounting issues which have a material adverse effect on our financial statements and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract and maintain a critical mass of ALR listings and travelers, whether due to competition or other factors, our travel marketplace will become less valuable to property owners and managers and to travelers, and it could significantly decrease our ability to generate revenue and net income from such travel division in the future.\nWe anticipate that moving forward, most of our travel division revenue will be generated when ALRs are booked by either customers to our website or by customers to distributors we provide ALRs to (\u201cDistributors\u201d). Our travel revenue will be the difference between the funds received from our customers and distributors versus the net amount owed to the property owner/manager at the time of booking. Accordingly, the success of our travel division primarily depends on our ability to attract owners, managers and travelers to NextTrip.com, NextTripVacations.com, Maupintour.com (soon to be rebranded as NextTrip Journeys) and to Distributors. If property owners and managers choose not to market their ALRs through our websites or instead list them with a competitor, we may be unable to offer a sufficient supply and variety of ALRs to attract travelers to our websites. Similarly, our volume of new and renewal listings may suffer if we are unable to attract travelers to our websites or, to the Distributors. As a result of any of these events, the perceived usefulness of our online marketplace and the relationships with Distributors may decline, and, consequently, it could significantly decrease our ability to generate travel revenue and net income in the future. As a result, the value of our securities may decline in value or become worthless.\nWe agreed to pay significant amounts to IDS, Inc. pursuant to the Property Purchase Agreement and related agreements.\nEffective on May 18, 2021, the Company, IDS, TD Asset and Ari Daniels, the principal of IDS, entered into an Amendment to Intellectual Property Purchase Agreement (IP Purchase Amendment). Pursuant to the IP Purchase Agreement, the parties amended the IP Purchase Agreement, with the Company agreeing to make a payment to IDS in the amount of $2,850,000, payable by way of an initial payment of $500,000, and twelve monthly payments of approximately $195,833, with such monthly payments beginning 30 days after the initial payment, which is due seven days after the date of the IP Purchase Amendment, and has been paid to date. Such monthly payments may be pre-paid at any time without penalty. At the Company\u2019s option, any portion of the amount due may be paid to IDS by a party separate from the Company (either a related party of Monaker or a third-party), for the benefit of Monaker, which shall be treated for all purposes as a payment by Monaker. As consideration for such Paying Party making such payment on behalf of Monaker, IDS agreed to transfer the Paying Party a number of the IDS Shares equal to the amount of the cash payment(s) made by a Paying Party multiplied by 0.6888 as to the first $500,000 payment (which payment has been made, but which shares have not been transferred to the Company to date), and 0.691 as to the monthly payments (as applicable, the \u201cApplicable Portion\u201d of the IDS Shares).\nIn the event the Company fails to make any payment timely, and the Company does not cure such default within seven days of written notice of default being provided by IDS, IDS is entitled to entry of a default judgment against the Company in the amount of the differential, if any, between the realized value of the IDS Shares upon the future sale thereof in the open market by IDS, and the unpaid amount of any payment due. In the event of any such default, IDS will be entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees incurred to obtain said judgment.\nUpon each payment of amounts due to IDS pursuant to the terms of the IP Agreement Amendment as discussed above by Monaker (instead of a Paying Party), IDS agreed to transfer the portion of the IDS Shares equal to the Applicable Portion, to the Company.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to pay the amounts due to IDS pursuant to the IP Agreement Amendment.\nOur travel revenues and results of travel operations are subject to the ability of our distributors and partners to integrate our ALRs with their websites, and the timing of such integrations.\nThe integration of our ALRs with our distributors and partners\u2019 websites is complicated and may involve various software components and application program interfaces (APIs). The ALR listings of our distributors and partners may be formatted differently or stored differently and may require modifications in order to receive and display our ALR properties correctly.\nThe timing of the integration of our distributors\u2019 ability to access our ALR offerings stored in the Monaker Booking Engine is significantly dependent on the ability of such distributors to implement processes, procedures and in some cases, software or systems to integrate with our API, which will enable them to list our ALRs on their websites. We have little to no control over those processes, or the timing of such integrations.\nOur future travel revenues and results of travel operations are substantially dependent on the timing of those integrations and in some cases the willingness of our distributors and partners to undertake additional steps and processes in order to provide us what we need, and in the form that we need, to implement such integrations. The failure of our partners and/or distributors to undertake the actions required so that we can successfully integrate our offerings, and/or any delay in such integrations, may have a negative effect on our travel revenues and results of travel operations and cause the value of our common stock to decline in value. The actions of our partners and distributors, and/or their ability to undertake such actions, may further be limited by the effects of COVID-19.\nOur travel business will depend substantially on property owners and managers renewing their listings.\nOur travel business will depend substantially on property owners and managers renewing their listings. Significant declines in our listing renewals could harm our expected travel operating results. Property owners and managers will generally market their vacation rentals on our websites with no obligation to renew. We may be unable to predict future listing renewal rates accurately, and our renewal rates may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors. These factors include property owners\u2019 decisions to sell or to cease renting their properties, their decisions to use the services of our competitors, or their dissatisfaction with our pricing, products, services or websites. Property owners and managers may not establish or renew listings if we cannot generate a large number of travelers who book vacation rentals through our marketplace and/or through our distributors. As a result, our revenue may decline and our results of operations may be negatively affected. In addition to the above, property owners may be unable (due to governmental restrictions) or unwilling (due to fear of contagion and other risks) to renew their listings due to COVID-19 and the governmental responses thereto.\nIf Distributors are unable to drive customers to their websites and/or we are unable to drive visitors to our websites, from search engines or otherwise, this could negatively impact transactions on the websites of our Distributor websites as well as our websites and consequently cause our travel revenue to decrease.\nMany visitors find the Distributors and our websites by searching for vacation rental information through Internet search engines. A critical factor in attracting visitors to our websites, and those of our Distributors, is how prominently our Distributors and we are displayed in response to search queries. Accordingly, we utilize search engine marketing, or SEM, as a means to provide a significant portion of our visitor acquisition. SEM includes both paid visitor acquisition (on a cost-per-click basis) and unpaid visitor acquisition, which is often referred to as organic search.\nWe plan to employ search engine optimization, or SEO to acquire visitors. SEO involves developing our websites in order to rank highly in relevant search queries. In addition to SEM and SEO, we may also utilize other forms of marketing to drive visitors to our websites, including branded search, display advertising and email marketing.\nThe various search engine providers, such as Google and Bing, employ proprietary algorithms and other methods for determining which websites are displayed for a given search query and how highly websites rank. Search engine providers may change these methods in a way that may negatively affect the number of visitors to our Distributors\u2019 websites as well as our own websites and may do so without public announcement or detailed explanation. Therefore, the success of our SEO and SEM strategy depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and respond to such changes in a timely and effective manner.\nIn addition, websites must comply with search engine guidelines and policies. These guidelines and policies are complex and may change at any time. If we or our Distributors fail to follow such guidelines and policies properly, the search engine may cause our content to rank lower in search results or could remove the content altogether. If we or our Distributors fail to understand and comply with these guidelines and policies and ensure our websites\u2019 compliance, our SEO and SEM strategy may not be successful.\nIf our Distributors or we are listed less prominently or fail to appear in search result listings for any reason, including as a result of our failure to successfully execute our SEO and SEM strategy, it is likely that we will acquire fewer visitors to our websites. Fewer visitors to our websites could lead to property owners and managers becoming dissatisfied with our websites, as well as fewer travelers inquiring and booking through our websites, either or both of which could adversely impact our revenue. We may not be able to replace this traffic in a cost-effective manner from other channels, such as cost-per-click SEM or display or other advertising, or even at all. Any attempt to replace this traffic through other channels may increase our sales and marketing expenditures, which could adversely affect our operating results relating to our travel division.\nUnfavorable changes in, or interpretations of, government regulations or taxation of the evolving alternative lodging rental (ALR), Internet and e-commerce industries could harm our travel division operating results.\nWe have contracted for ALRs in markets throughout the world, in jurisdictions which have various regulatory and taxation requirements that can affect our travel division operations or regulate the rental activity of property owners and managers.\nCompliance with laws and regulations of different jurisdictions imposing different standards and requirements is very burdensome because each region has different regulations with respect to licensing and other requirements for ALRs. Our online marketplaces are accessible by property owners, managers and travelers in many states and foreign jurisdictions. Our efficiencies and economies of scale depend on generally uniform treatment of property owners, managers and travelers across all jurisdictions. Compliance requirements that vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction impose added costs and increased liabilities for compliance deficiencies. In addition, laws or regulations that may harm our business could be adopted, or interpreted in a manner that affects our activities, including but not limited to the regulation of personal and consumer information and real estate licensing requirements. Violations or new interpretations of these laws or regulations may result in penalties, negatively impact our operations and damage our reputation and business.\nIn addition, regulatory developments may affect the ALR industry and the ability of companies like us to list those vacation rentals online. For example, some municipalities have adopted ordinances that limit the ability of property owners and managers to rent certain properties for fewer than 30 consecutive days and other cities may introduce similar regulations. Some cities also have fair housing or other laws governing whether and how properties may be rented, which they assert apply to ALR. Many homeowners, condominium and neighborhood associations have adopted rules that prohibit or restrict short-term vacation rentals. In addition, many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose taxes or other obligations on travel and lodging companies were established before the growth of the Internet and e-commerce, which creates a risk of these laws being used, in ways not originally intended, that could burden property owners and managers or otherwise harm our business. These and other similar new and newly interpreted regulations could increase costs for, or otherwise discourage, owners and managers from listing their property with us, which could harm our business and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in challenges to, or disputes with government agencies regarding, these regulations. We may not be successful in defending against the application of these laws and regulations. Further, if we were required to comply with regulations and government requests that negatively impact our relations with property owners, managers and travelers, our business, travel division operations and financial results could be adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, new, changed, or newly interpreted or applied tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could increase our property owners\u2019 and managers\u2019 and our compliance, operating and other costs. This, in turn, could deter property owners and managers from renting their ALR properties, negatively affect our new listings and renewals, or increase costs of doing business. Any or all of these events could adversely impact our business and financial performance.\nFurthermore, as we expand or change the products and services that we offer or the methods by which we offer them, we may become subject to additional legal regulations, tax requirements or other risks. Regulators may seek to impose regulations and requirements on us even if we utilize third parties to offer the products or services. These regulations and requirements may apply to payment processing, insurance products or the various other products and services we may now or in the future offer or facilitate through our marketplace. Whether we comply with or challenge these additional regulations, our costs may increase and our business may otherwise be harmed.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our NextTrip brand and the brands associated with each of our websites, our reputation and business may suffer.\nIt is important for us to maintain and enhance our brand identity in order to attract and retain property owners, managers, distributors and travelers. The successful promotion of our brands will depend largely on our marketing and public relations efforts. We expect that the promotion of our brands will require us to make substantial investments, and, as our market becomes more competitive, these branding initiatives may become increasingly difficult and expensive. In addition, we may not be able to successfully build our NextTrip brand identity without losing value associated with, or decreasing the effectiveness of, our other brand identities. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brands, we could lose traveler traffic, which could, in turn, cause property owners and managers to terminate or elect not to renew their listings with us. In addition, our brand promotion activities may not be successful or may not yield revenue sufficient to offset their cost, which could adversely affect our reputation and business.\nOur long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand our property owner, manager and traveler bases outside of the United States and, as a result, our business is susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nWe have limited operating and e-commerce experience in many foreign jurisdictions and are making significant investments to build our international operations. We plan to continue our efforts to expand globally, including acquiring international businesses and conducting business in jurisdictions where we do not currently operate. Managing a global organization is difficult, time consuming and expensive and any international expansion efforts that we undertake may not be profitable in the near or long term or otherwise be successful. In addition, conducting international operations subjects us to risks that include:\n\u25cf the cost and resources required to localize our services, which requires the translation of our websites and their adaptation for local practices and legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf adjusting the products and services we provide in foreign jurisdictions, as needed, to better address the needs of local owners, managers, distributors and travelers, and the threats of local competitors;\n\u25cf being subject to foreign laws and regulations, including those laws governing Internet activities, email messaging, collection and use of personal information, ownership of intellectual property, taxation and other activities important to our online business practices, which may be less developed, less predictable, more restrictive, and less familiar, and which may adversely affect financial results in certain regions;\n\u25cf competition with companies that understand the local market better than we do or who have pre-existing relationships with property owners, managers, distributors and travelers in those markets;\n\u25cf legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the transactions and content on our websites, including online bookings, property listings and other content provided by property owners and managers, including uncertainty resulting from unique local laws or a lack of clear precedent of applicable law;\n\u25cf lack of familiarity with and the burden of complying with a wide variety of other foreign laws, legal standards and foreign regulatory requirements, including invoicing, data collection and storage, financial reporting and tax compliance requirements, which are subject to unexpected changes;\n\u25cf laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses;\n\u25cf challenges associated with joint venture relationships and minority investments;\n\u25cf adapting to variations in foreign payment forms;\n\u25cf difficulties in managing and staffing international operations and establishing or maintaining operational efficiencies;\n\u25cf difficulties in establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls and security over our data and systems;\n\u25cf currency exchange restrictions and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf potentially adverse tax consequences, which may be difficult to predict, including the complexities of foreign value added tax systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u25cf increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities and difficulties in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls;\n\u25cf political, social and economic instability abroad, war, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general;\n\u25cf the potential failure of financial institutions internationally;\n\u25cf varying effects of global pandemics and epidemics, including COVID-19 on different countries;\n\u25cf reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u25cf higher telecommunications and Internet service provider costs.\nOperating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot guarantee that our international expansion efforts in any or multiple territories will be successful. The investment and additional resources required to establish operations and manage growth in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenue or profitability and could instead result in increased costs.\nThe market in which we participate is highly competitive, and we may be unable to compete successfully with our current or future competitors.\nThe market to provide listing, search and marketing services for the ALR industry is very competitive and highly fragmented. In addition, the barriers to entry are low and new competitors may enter. All of the services that we plan to provide to property owners, managers and travelers, including listing and search, are provided separately or in combination by current or potential competitors. Our competitors may adopt aspects of our business model, which could reduce our ability to differentiate our services. Additionally, current or new competitors may introduce new business models or services that we may need to adopt or otherwise adapt to in order to compete, which could reduce our ability to differentiate our business or services from those of our competitors. Furthermore, properties in the ALR industry are not typically marketed exclusively through any single channel, and our listing agreements are not typically exclusive. Accordingly, our competitors could aggregate a set of listings similar to ours. Increased competition could result in a reduction in revenue, rate of new listing acquisition, existing listings or market share.\nThere are thousands of vacation rental listing websites that compete directly with us for listings, travelers, or both, such as Booking.com, HomeAway.com, Airbnb, and TripAdvisor. Many of these competitors offer free or heavily discounted listings or focus on a particular geographic location or a specific type of rental property. Some of them also aggregate property listings obtained through various sources, including the websites of property managers some of whom will also market their properties on our websites.\nCompetitors also operate websites directed at the wider fragmented travel lodging market, such as Airbnb and HomeAway by listing either rooms or the owner\u2019s primary home. These properties increase both the number of rental opportunities available to travelers and the competition for the attention of the traveler. Some vacation rental property owners and managers also list on these websites, and consequently, these companies currently compete with us to some extent.\nWe will also compete with online travel agency websites, such as Expedia, Hotels.com, Kayak, Priceline, Booking.com, Orbitz and Travelocity, which have traditionally provided comprehensive travel services and some of whom are now expanding into the vacation rental category. We also compete with large Internet search companies, such as craigslist, eBay, Google, MSN.com and Yahoo!, which provide listing or advertising services in addition to a wide variety of other products or services. In addition, some competitors, such as Perfect Places, Inc., Atraveo and eDomizil, predominately serve the professional property manager marketplace, and therefore have the ability to create more products and features targeted to property managers. Hotels, corporate travel providers, travel metasearch engines, travel content aggregators, mobile platform travel applications, social media websites, and even mobile computing hardware providers all also have the potential to increase their competitive presence in the areas of our business as well.\nWe believe we will compete primarily on the basis of the quantity and quality of our listings, the quality of the direct relationships we have with distributors, property owners and managers, the volume of expected travelers who will visit our websites, the global diversity of the vacation rentals available on our websites, the quality of our websites, the tools provided to our distributors, property owners and managers to assist them with their business, customer service, brand identity, the success of our marketing programs, and price. If current or potential property owners, managers, distributors or travelers choose to use any of these competitive offerings in lieu of ours, our revenue could decrease and we could be required to make additional expenditures to compete more effectively. Any of these events or results could harm our travel division business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, most of our current or potential competitors are larger and have more resources than we do. Many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition in their markets, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, our current or potential competitors may have access to larger property owner, manager or traveler bases. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or owner, manager or traveler requirements, including, but not limited to those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, because of these advantages, existing and potential owners, managers, distributors and travelers might accept our competitors\u2019 offerings, even if they may be inferior to ours. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.\nIf the businesses and/or assets that we have acquired or invested in do not perform as expected or we are unable to effectively integrate acquired businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed.\nWe have four platforms, a library of travel footage, equity investments in Verus International, Inc, NestBuilder.com, Bettwork Industries Inc, Recruiter.com Group, Inc., Longroot Thailand, Reinhart, and our acquisition of control of IFEB and HotPlay, which are pending, subject to required approvals and closing conditions. The businesses we have acquired, or invested in, may not perform as well as we expect. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies could harm our operating results and our prospects. If the companies we have invested in do not perform well, our investments could become impaired and our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nOur future mergers and acquisitions, if any, will involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u25cf difficulties in integrating and managing the combined operations, technologies, technology platforms and products of the acquired companies and realizing the anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems;\n\u25cf legal or regulatory challenges or post-acquisition litigation, which could result in significant costs or require changes to the businesses or unwinding of the transaction;\n\u25cf failure of the acquired company or assets to achieve anticipated revenue, earnings or cash flow;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention or other resources from our existing business;\n\u25cf our inability to maintain key distributors and business relationships, and the reputations of acquired businesses;\n\u25cf uncertainty resulting from entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience or in which competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u25cf our dependence on unfamiliar affiliates and partners of acquired businesses;\n\u25cf unanticipated costs associated with pursuing acquisitions;\n\u25cf liabilities of acquired businesses, which may not be disclosed to us or which may exceed our estimates, including liabilities relating to non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, such as data protection and privacy controls;\n\u25cf difficulties in assigning or transferring to us or our subsidiaries intellectual property licensed to companies we acquired;\n\u25cf difficulties in maintaining our internal standards, controls, procedures and policies including financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and extending these controls to acquired companies;\n\u25cf potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies;\n\u25cf difficulties in complying with antitrust and other government regulations;\n\u25cf challenges in integrating and auditing the financial statements of acquired companies that have not historically prepared financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and\n\u25cf potential accounting charges to the extent intangibles recorded in connection with an acquisition, such as goodwill, trademarks, customer relationships or intellectual property, are later determined to be impaired and written down in value.\nMoreover, we rely heavily on the representations and warranties provided to us by the sellers of acquired companies and assets, including as they relate to creation, ownership and rights in intellectual property, existence of open-source software and compliance with laws and contractual requirements. If any of these representations and warranties are inaccurate or breached, such inaccuracy or breach could result in costly litigation and assessment of liability for which there may not be adequate recourse against such sellers, in part due to contractual time limitations and limitations of liability.\nIf we are unable to introduce new or upgraded products, services or features that distributors, travelers or property owners and managers recognize as valuable, we may fail to (i) drive additional travelers to the websites of our distributors, (ii) drive additional travelers to our websites, (iii) retain existing property owners and managers, (iv) attract new property owners and managers, (v) retain existing distributors, and/or (vi) attract new distributors. Our efforts to develop new and upgraded services and products could require us to incur significant costs.\nIn order to attract travelers to (i) our distributors, as well as (ii) our own online marketplace while retaining, and attracting new, distributors, property owners and managers, we will need to continue to invest in the development of new products, services and features that both add value for travelers, distributors, property owners and managers and differentiate us from our competitors. The success of new products, services and features depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the product, service or feature. If travelers, distributors, property owners or managers do not recognize the value of our new services or features, they may choose not to utilize our products or list on our online marketplace.\nAttempting to develop and deliver these new or upgraded products, services or features involves inherent hazards and difficulties, and is costly. Efforts to enhance and improve the ease of use, responsiveness, functionality and features of our existing websites have inherent risks, and we may not be able to manage these product developments and enhancements successfully. We may not succeed in developing new or upgraded products, services or features or new or upgraded products, services or features may not work as intended or provide value. In addition, some new or upgraded products, services or features may be difficult for us to market and may also involve unfavorable pricing. Even if we succeed, we cannot guarantee that our property owners and managers will respond favorably.\nIn addition to developing our own improvements, we may choose to license or otherwise integrate applications, content and data from third parties. The introduction of these improvements imposes costs on us and creates a risk that we may be unable to continue to access these technologies and content on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. In the event we fail to develop new or upgraded products, services or features, the demand for our services and ultimately our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe have a relatively limited operating history and we operate in a rapidly evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects. If we fail to predict the manner in which our business will perform or how the market will develop, our business and prospects may suffer materially.\nOur limited operating history, together with our rapidly changing industry, may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries. These include challenges in accurate financial planning and forecasting as we develop new products or strategic plans with little or no historical reference as a basis for such planning and forecasting. These risks will be exacerbated by the effects and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic and the duration thereof. Our business and prospects should be considered in light of the risks and difficulties we may encounter as a company operating in a highly competitive environment where changes to our business, plans, and products may be required to respond to such changes.\nIn addition, the market for online ALRs is relatively new and, in many territories, is unproven with little data or research available regarding the market and industry. It is uncertain whether the ALR market in many territories will continue to develop or if our services will achieve and sustain a level of demand and market acceptance sufficient for us to generate revenue, net income and cash flow growth, at anticipated levels or at all; we may need to focus on, or offer, different types of products and services in order to remain competitive. Our success will depend, to a substantial extent, on the willingness of property owners and managers to use commercial online rental property listing services. Some property managers have developed (and use) their own proprietary online listing services and, therefore, may be reluctant or unwilling to use our services to market their properties. Furthermore, some travelers and property owners and managers may be reluctant or unwilling to use online listing services because of concerns regarding the security of data, the potential for fraudulent activity, including phishing, or the integrity of the online marketplace. If property owners and managers do not perceive the benefits of marketing their properties online, then our market may not develop as we expect, or it may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which could significantly harm our business and operating results. Moreover, our success will depend on travelers\u2019 use of our distributors, as well as our own, online marketplace to search, locate and rent vacation rentals, which will depend on their willingness to use the Internet and their belief in the integrity of the websites. In addition, since we operate in unproven and unstudied markets, we have limited insight into trends that may develop in those markets and may affect our business. We may make errors in predicting and reacting to other relevant business trends, which could harm our business.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nBecause we plan to conduct a significant portion of our business outside the United States but report our results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates, which may cause our revenue and operating results to differ materially from expectations. In addition, fluctuation in our mix of U.S. and foreign currency denominated transactions may contribute to this effect as exchange rates vary. Moreover, as a result of these exchange rate fluctuations, revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses and other operating results may differ materially from expectations when translated from the local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. For example, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to foreign currencies our non-U.S. revenue would be adversely affected when translated into U.S. dollars. Conversely, a decline in the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies would increase our non-U.S. revenue when translated into U.S. dollars. We may enter into hedging arrangements in order to manage foreign currency exposure but such activity may not completely eliminate fluctuations in our operating results.\nOur business depends on retaining and attracting capable management and operating personnel.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management and operating personnel, as well as skilled technical and marketing personnel, who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers. Competition for qualified employees is intense in our industry, and the loss of even a few qualified employees, or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the planned expansion of our business could harm our operating results and impair our ability to grow. To attract and retain key personnel, we use various measures, including an equity incentive program and incentive bonuses for executive officers and other key employees. While we attempt to provide additional or different incentive compensation tools to mitigate this impact, the measures we employ to attract and maintain key personnel may not be effective enough to enable us to attract and retain the personnel we require to operate our business effectively.\nIf we lose the services of our key personnel, including Mr. William Kerby, our Chief Executive Officer, our business would be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we do not have \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance, and we do not presently intend to purchase such insurance, on Mr. Kerby or any of our other key personnel. We believe that our success is substantially dependent upon: (1) our ability to retain and motivate our senior management team and other key employees; and (2) our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other qualified personnel. The development of our business and operations is dependent upon the efforts and talents of our executive officers, whose extensive experience and contacts within the industries in which we wish to compete are a critical component of our business strategy. We may not be successful in retaining the services of any of the members of our senior management team or other key personnel, or in hiring qualified technical, managerial, marketing and administrative personnel. If we do not succeed in retaining our employees and in attracting new employees, our business could suffer significantly.\nThe employment agreements of our officers include limited non-solicitation and non-compete provisions and provide for severance pay upon termination of such agreements for certain reasons.\nWe are party to employment agreements with our Chief Executive Officer, William Kerby, our Chief Financial Officer, Sirapop \u201cKent\u201d Taepakdee, and our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Information Officer, Timothy Sikora.\nMr. Kerby\u2019s employment agreement remains in effect indefinitely until either party provides the other at least 30 days prior written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement, or until terminated pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The agreement includes a non-compete provision, prohibiting Mr. Kerby from competing against the Company during the term of the agreement and for a period of 12 months after termination thereof (subject to certain exceptions), in any state or country in connection with (A) the offer of ALR properties (Vacation Home Rentals) which are distributed on a B2B Basis; (B) the commercial sale of specialty products sold by the Company during the six (6) months preceding the termination date; and (C) any services the Company commercially offered during the six (6) months prior to the termination date (collectively, the \u201cNon-Compete\u201d).\nIn the event of termination of the agreement for death or disability, or termination by Mr. Kerby without good reason (defined in the agreement), or for cause (defined in the agreement) by the Company, Mr. Kerby is due all consideration due and payable to him through the date of termination. In the event of termination of the agreement by Mr. Kerby for good reason or the Company for any reason other than cause (or if Mr. Kerby\u2019s employment is terminated other than for cause within six (6) months before or twenty-four (24) months following the occurrence of a change of control (defined in the agreement) of the Company, provided that we believe the closing of the HotPlay Exchange Agreement will be deemed a change of control under the agreement), Mr. Kerby is due all consideration due and payable through the date of termination; a lump sum payment equal to twelve (12) months of base salary; continued participation in all benefit plans and programs of the Company for twelve (12) months after termination (or at the option of the Company, reimbursement of COBRA insurance premiums for substantially similar coverage as the Company\u2019s plans); and the Non-Compete will not apply to Mr. Kerby.\nMr. Taepakdee, our Chief Financial Officer, entered into an employment agreement, dated January 30, 2020. If the agreement is terminated by Mr. Taepakdee for good reason (as defined in the agreement) or by the Company without cause, and other than due to Mr. Taepakdee\u2019s death or disability, Mr. Taepakdee is due two calendar months of severance pay. If the agreement is terminated due to Mr. Taepakdee\u2019s disability, Mr. Taepakdee is due compensation through the remainder of the month during which such termination is effective. If the Company terminates the agreement within 24 months after a change in control event, then the Company is required to pay Mr. Taepakdee a severance payment equal to twelve (12) months\u2019 salary, plus continue to provide benefits equal to those provided prior to the change in control event for a period of six (6) months (we believe the closing of the HotPlay exchange agreement will be deemed a change of control under the agreement). The agreement includes a one-year non-solicitation and non-competition clause following the date of the termination of the agreement, which non-competition clause prohibits him (without the prior written consent of the Company which consent will not be unreasonably withheld) from directly or through another person or another entity carrying on or being engaged in any business within North America which is competitive with the business of the Company, however, the non-compete shall terminate in the event of a termination of employment by Mr. Taepakdee for good reason or a termination by the Company other than for cause or disability.\nMr. Sikora, our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Information Officer, entered into an employment agreement, dated January 30, 2020. If the agreement is terminated by Mr. Sikora for good reason (as defined in the agreement) or by the Company without cause, and other than due to Mr. Sikora\u2019s death or disability, Mr. Sikora is due two calendar months of severance pay. If the agreement is terminated due to Mr. Sikora\u2019s disability, Mr. Sikora is due compensation through the remainder of the month during which such termination is effective. If the Company terminates the agreement within 24 months after a change in control event, then the Company shall pay Mr. Sikora a severance payment equal to twelve (12) months\u2019 salary, plus continue to provide benefits equal to those provided prior to the change in control event for a period of six (6) months (we believe the closing of the HotPlay exchange agreement will be deemed a change of control under the agreement). The agreement includes a one-year non-solicitation and non-competition clause following the date of the termination of the agreement, which non-competition clause prohibits him (without the prior written consent of the Company which consent will not be unreasonably withheld) from directly or through another person or another entity carrying on or being engaged in any business within North America which is competitive with the business of the Company, however, the non-compete shall terminate in the event of a termination of employment by Mr. Sikora for good reason or a termination by the Company other than for cause or disability.\nThe automatic renewal feature of Mr. Kerby\u2019s agreement may prevent us from terminating the employment of such officer, and the non-solicitation and non-compete provisions of the agreements with the executive officers may not provide us adequate protection from such persons competing with us after their termination, and the severance pay payable to such individuals may make it costly to terminate the employment of such individuals, make us less attractive for potential acquirers or prevent a change of control.\nWe agreed to pay certain fees to Mr. William Kerby, our Chief Executive Officer in consideration for such individual guarantying and continuing to guarantee, certain of our obligations.\nPursuant to Mr. Kerby\u2019s employment agreement, as additional consideration for Mr. Kerby having entered into numerous personal guarantees with the Airline Reporting Commission, sellers of travel services, merchant providers, financial institutions, associations and service providers on behalf of the Company, the Company agreed that, for as long as Mr. Kerby is employed by the Company, provides services under the employment agreement and is willing to continue to support the Company in connection with such guarantees, he will receive a $2,000 per month guarantee fee. In the event Mr. Kerby resigns for good reason (defined in the employment agreement), or his employment is terminated by the Company, the Company agreed to eliminate any and all guarantees within thirty (30) days, failing which, for each month the guarantees remain in place, the monthly guarantee fee will rise to $10,000 per month, until such time as the Company has assumed or terminated all such guarantees.\nThe aggregate of such guaranty fees may be significant and may reduce the amount of available funding available for the Company to undertake its operations, repay its liabilities and/or expand its operations. In the event the guaranty fees rise as described above, the Company may not have available funds to pay such fees, and the amount of such fees may further reduce the amount of cash the Company has for business activities and growth. The amount of such guaranty fees may reduce the trading value of the Company\u2019s common stock and/or have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s available cash and results of operations.\nIf we fail to protect confidential information against security breaches, or if distributors, property owners, managers or travelers are reluctant to use our online marketplace because of privacy or security concerns, we might face additional costs, and activity on our websites could decline.\nWe collect and use personally identifiable information of distributors, property owners, managers and travelers in the operation of our business. Our systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins that our security measures may not detect. Anyone that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate confidential or proprietary information, cause an interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation and business. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Security breaches of our systems, or even the systems of third parties we rely upon, such as credit card processors, could damage our reputation and expose us to litigation and possible liability under various laws and regulations. In addition, industry-wide incidents, or incidents specific to us, could deter people from using our distributors\u2019, as well as our online marketplaces. Concern among distributors, property owners, managers and travelers regarding our use of personal information collected on our websites could keep them from using, or continuing to use, our online marketplace.\nThere are risks of security breaches both on our own systems and on third party systems which store our information as we increase the types of technology that we use to operate our marketplace, such as mobile applications. New and evolving technology systems and platforms may involve security risks that are difficult to predict and adequately guard against. In addition, third parties that process credit card transactions between us and property owners and managers maintain personal information collected from them. Such information could be stolen or misappropriated, and we could be subject to liability as a result. Further, property owners and managers may develop a lack of confidence in these third parties or in their ability to securely conduct credit card transactions on our distributors\u2019 websites, our websites or the Internet in general, which could adversely impact our business, revenue and operating results. Our property owners, managers and travelers may be harmed by such breaches and we may in turn be subject to costly litigation or regulatory compliance costs, and harm to our reputation and brand. Moreover, some property owners, managers and travelers may cease using our marketplace altogether.\nThe laws of some states and countries require businesses that maintain personal information about their residents in electronic databases to implement reasonable measures to keep that information secure. Our practice is to encrypt all sensitive information, but we do not know whether our current practice will be challenged under these laws. In addition, under certain of these laws, if there is a breach of our computer systems and we know or suspect that unencrypted personal data has been stolen, we are required to inform any user whose data was stolen, which could harm our reputation and business. Complying with the applicable notice requirements in the event of a security breach could result in significant costs. We may also be subject to contractual claims, investigation and penalties by regulatory authorities, and claims by persons whose information was disclosed.\nCompounding these legal risks, many states and countries have enacted different and often contradictory requirements for protecting personal information collected and maintained electronically. Compliance with these numerous and contradictory requirements is particularly difficult for us because we collect personal information from users in multiple jurisdictions. While we intend to comply fully with these laws, failure to comply could result in legal liability, cause us to suffer adverse publicity and lose business, traffic and revenue. If we were required to pay any significant amount of money in satisfaction of claims under these or similar laws, or if we were forced to cease our business operations for any length of time as a result of our inability to comply fully, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, third parties may target users of our websites directly with attempts to breach the security of their email accounts or management systems, such as through phishing attacks, which are fraudulent identity theft schemes designed to appear as legitimate emails from us or from our property owners and managers. Criminals may also employ other schemes aimed at defrauding our property owners, managers or travelers in ways that we may not anticipate or be able to adequately guard against. Although phishing attacks and other fraud schemes are generally not carried out through our systems, victims may nevertheless seek recovery from us. As a result, we may be required to defend ourselves in costly litigation and may suffer harm to our reputation, brand and business.\nIn the event any of the above risks were to occur, our reputation could be harmed, we and/or our distributors could lose either website traffic or users, and as a result, our results of operations and the value of our securities could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to adapt to changes in technology, our business could be harmed.\nBecause property owners, managers and travelers can access our websites using a variety of hardware and software platforms, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our service to keep pace with related technological changes. We may not be successful in developing necessary, functional and popular modifications and enhancements. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of these necessary changes could result in unplanned research and development expenses. In addition, any failure of our online marketplace to operate effectively with future technologies could result in dissatisfaction from travelers, distributors, property owners, and managers, any of which could harm our travel division business.\nWe may be subject to liability for the activities of our property owners and managers, which could harm our reputation and increase our operating costs.\nWe may receive complaints related to certain activities on our websites, including disputes over the authenticity of an ALR listing. We may be subject to claims of liability for unauthorized use of credit card and/or bank account information, identity theft, phishing attacks, potential breaches of system security, libel, and infringement of third-party copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights. Fraud may be purported by owners or managers listing properties which either do not exist or are significantly not as described in the listing. The methods used by perpetrators of fraud constantly evolve and are complex. Moreover, our trust and security measures may not detect all fraudulent activity. Consequently, we expect to receive complaints from travelers and requests for reimbursement of their rental fees, as well as actual or threatened related legal action against us in the usual course of business.\nWe may also be subject to claims of liability based on events that occur during travelers\u2019 stays at ALRs, including those related to robbery, injury, death, and other similar incidents. These types of claims could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business and results of operations, even if these claims do not result in liability, as we incur costs related to investigation and defense. The available terms and conditions of our websites specifically state that we are exempt from any liability to travelers relating to these matters. However, the enforceability of these terms varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the laws in this area are consistently evolving. If we are subject to liability or claims of liability relating to the acts of our property owners or managers, or due to fraudulent listings, we may be subject to negative publicity, incur additional expenses and be subject to liability, any of which could harm our business and our operating results.\nLoss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have a material adverse effect on our travel division business and operating results. Credit card acceptance privileges involve additional potential costs relating to reimbursements and fraud.\nThe loss of our credit card acceptance privileges could significantly limit the availability and desirability of our products and services. Moreover, if we fail to fully perform our contractual obligations, we could be obligated to reimburse credit card companies for refunded payments that have been contested by the cardholders. In addition, even when we are in compliance with these obligations, we bear other expenses including those related to the acceptance of fraudulent credit cards. As a result of all of these risks, credit card companies may require us to set aside additional cash reserves, may increase the transaction fees they charge us, or may even refuse to renew our acceptance privileges.\nIn addition, credit card networks, such as Visa, MasterCard and American Express, have adopted rules and regulations that apply to all merchants who process and accept credit cards and include the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, or the PCI DSS. Under these rules, we are required to adopt and implement internal controls over the use, storage and security of card data. We assess our compliance with the PCI DSS rules on a periodic basis and make necessary improvements to our internal controls. Failure to comply may subject us to fines, penalties, damages and civil liability and could prevent us from processing or accepting credit cards. However, we cannot guarantee that compliance with these rules will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft, loss or misuse of the credit card data.\nThe loss of, or the significant modification of, the terms under which we obtain credit card acceptance privileges could have a material adverse effect on our travel division business, revenue and operating results.\nOur travel division revenue, expenses and operating results could be negatively affected by changes in travel, real estate and ALR markets, as well as general economic conditions.\nOur travel division business is particularly sensitive to trends in the travel, real estate and vacation rental markets, which are unpredictable, as well as trends in the general economy. Therefore, our travel division operating results, to the extent they reflect changes in the broader travel, real estate and vacation rental industries, may be subject to significant fluctuations. For example, changes in the travel industry, such as disruptions caused by war, terrorist attacks, pandemics and epidemics (including the recent changes caused by COVID-19), natural disasters, weather, bankruptcies or diseases could significantly reduce the willingness of potential travelers to plan vacation and other travel. Such disruptions that harm or destroy vacation homes could cause the property owners and managers of such homes to cancel or fail to renew their listings. Downturns in real estate markets may result in decreased new building rates and increases in foreclosures, which could also result in fewer vacation rentals available for listing. Also, since vacation travel is generally dependent on discretionary spending, negative general economic conditions could significantly reduce the overall amount that travelers spend on vacation travel.\nAdditionally, property owners may choose or be forced to sell their vacation rentals during periods of economic slowdown or recession. Any or all of these factors could reduce the demand for vacation rentals and our services, thereby reducing our revenue. This in turn could increase our need to make significant expenditures to continue to attract distributors, property owners, managers and travelers to our websites.\nVacation rentals are often located in popular vacation destinations around the world and utilized on a seasonal basis. Factors influencing the desirability of vacation rentals in a particular region or season could adversely affect our ability to obtain new listings and retain existing listings.\nALRs are often located in popular vacation destinations and utilized on a seasonal basis. As a result, our listings involve properties that are often concentrated in particular regions, and our revenue is dependent upon our ability (or willingness) to list properties in those regions. If we became unable (or unwilling) to list properties in a particular region, our listings in the region could decline or cease to grow, and revenue and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Notwithstanding the above, adverse economic conditions, or pandemics, including COVID-19, could result in future seasonal patterns that are different from historical trends.\nIn addition, factors influencing the desirability of ALRs in a particular region or during a specific season could adversely affect our ability to obtain new listings and retain existing listings. A significant natural disaster, political turmoil, pandemic, epidemic or other regional disturbance could reduce the number of available vacation rentals in that area, reducing our listing base and our revenue. In addition, if we do not have sufficient property listings in a newly popular vacation destination, we could fail to attract travelers; consequently, property owners and managers may opt to list their properties with a competitor having a greater presence in that area.\nAs described above, the global travel industry has experienced sharp declines in demand as a result of COVID-19 and the ultimate effects and longevity of such decreased demand is currently not known; however, such decrease in demand is expected to have a material adverse effect on our fiscal 2022 revenues and results of operations.\nWe could face liability for transactions and information on (or accessible through) our or, our distributors\u2019, online marketplaces.\nA significant portion of the information available through our and our distributors\u2019 online marketplaces is submitted by property owners and managers and third parties. Property owners and managers could assert that information concerning them on our websites contains errors or omissions and third parties could seek damages from us for losses incurred if they rely upon such incorrect information. We could also be subject to claims that such information is defamatory, libelous, or infringes on third-party copyrights and privacy and publicity rights. We might be subject to claims that by providing links to third party websites, we are liable for wrongful actions by those third parties. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against these claims.\nIn addition, our services will feature a property review platform, which allows travelers to post property reviews and other information about properties, property owners and managers. Although this feedback is generated by users and not by us, claims of libel, defamation or other injury have been made against other Internet service providers offering similar forums and may be made against us for content posted in this forum. Our potential liability for this information could require us to expend substantial resources to reduce our liability exposure and may limit the attractiveness of our and our distributors\u2019 online marketplace. Moreover, our general liability insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed and as a result we could face significant liability for such claims which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows.\nProperty owner, distributor, manager or traveler complaints or negative publicity about our company, our services or our business activities could diminish use of our online marketplace and our travel division brand.\nProperty owner, distributor, manager or traveler complaints or negative publicity about our company, our services or our business activities could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use of our online marketplace and negatively affect our travel division brand. Our measures to combat risks of fraud and breaches of privacy and security can damage relations with our property owners and managers, for instance when we remove listings which have repeatedly been reported as misleadingly described. These measures heighten the need for prompt and accurate customer service to resolve irregularities and disputes. Effective customer service requires significant personnel expense, and this expense, if not managed properly, could significantly impact our profitability. Failure to manage or train our customer service representatives properly could compromise our ability to handle property owner, manager and traveler complaints effectively. If we do not handle these complaints effectively, our reputation may suffer, and we may lose the confidence of property owners, distributors, managers and travelers. We may also be the subject of blog or forum postings that include inaccurate statements and create negative publicity. As a result of these complaints or negative publicity, property owners, distributors and managers may discontinue their listing or services with us or travelers may discontinue their use of our websites, and our business, brand and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe currently rely on a small number of third-party service providers to host and deliver a significant portion of our services, and any interruptions or delays in services from these third parties could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.\nWe rely on third-party service providers for numerous products and services, including payment processing services, data center services, web hosting services, insurance products for customers and travelers and some customer service functions. We rely on these companies to provide uninterrupted services and to provide their services in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.\nWe use a combination of third-party data centers to host our websites and core services. We do not control the operation of any of the third-party data center facilities we use. These facilities may be subject to break-ins, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, sabotage, acts of vandalism and other misconduct. They are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes and similar events. We currently do not have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan in place nor do our systems provide complete redundancy of data storage or processing. As a result, the occurrence of any of these events, a decision by our third-party service providers to close their data center facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in loss of data as well as a significant interruption in our services and harm to our reputation and brand. Additionally, our third-party data center facility agreements are of limited durations, and our third-party data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with these facilities on commercially reasonable terms, we may experience delays in the provisioning of our services until an agreement with another data center facility can be arranged. This shift to alternate data centers could take more than 24 hours depending on the nature of the event.\nFurthermore, we depend on continuous and uninterrupted access to the Internet through third-party bandwidth providers to operate our business. If we lose the services of one or more of our bandwidth providers for any reason or if their services are disrupted, we could experience disruption in our services or we could be required to retain the services of a replacement bandwidth provider, which could harm our business and reputation.\nOur operations are dependent on the availability of electricity, which also comes from third-party providers. If we or the third-party data center facilities that we use to deliver our services were to experience a major power outage, it could result in disruption of our services and harm to our business.\nIf these companies experience difficulties and are not able to provide services in a reliable and secure manner, if they do not operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and, with respect to payment and card processing companies, if they are unable to effectively combat the use of fraudulent payments on our websites, our results of operations and financial positions could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if such third-party service providers were to cease operations or face other business disruption either temporarily or permanently, or otherwise face serious performance problems, we could suffer increased costs and delays until we find or develop an equivalent replacement, any of which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance.\nOur processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data will expose us to risks of internal or external security breaches and could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.\nThe security of data when engaging in electronic commerce is essential in maintaining consumer and supplier confidence in our services. Substantial or ongoing security breaches whether instigated internally or externally on our systems or other internet-based systems could significantly harm our future business. It is possible that advances in computer circumvention capabilities, new discoveries or other developments, including our own acts or omissions, could result in a compromise or breach of customer transaction data.\nWe cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches or attacks. A party (whether internal, external, an affiliate or unrelated third party) that is able to circumvent our security systems could steal customer information or transaction data, proprietary information or cause significant interruptions in our operations. For instance, from time to time, companies have experienced \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d type attacks that have made portions of websites slow or unavailable for periods of time. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches, and reductions in website availability and response time could cause loss of substantial business volumes during the occurrence of any such incident. Security breaches could result in negative publicity, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject us to regulatory penalties and sanctions. Security breaches could also cause customers and potential customers to lose confidence in our security, which would have a negative effect on the value of our brand.\nWe also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties conducting business over the Internet. Consumers generally are concerned with security and privacy on the Internet, and any publicized security problems could inhibit the growth of the Internet and, therefore, our services as a means of conducting commercial transactions. Additionally, security breaches at third parties such as supplier or distributor systems upon which we may rely could result in negative publicity, damage our reputation, expose us to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject us to regulatory penalties and sanctions.\nIn our processing transactions, we expect to receive a large volume of personally identifiable data but, we will not store personally identifiable data. We could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls, it could adversely affect our financial position and lower our stock price.\nWe are subject to reporting and other obligations under the Exchange Act, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These provisions require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. We also operate in a complex environment and expect these obligations, together with our rapid growth and expansion through acquisitions, to place significant demands on our management and administrative resources, including accounting and tax resources. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, our investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports.\nWe have significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nRisks relating to our indebtedness include:\n\u25cf increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf making it more difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our businesses;\n\u25cf limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate;\n\u25cf possibly placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u25cf limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at rates or on other terms that we find acceptable.\nRisks Relating to The Share Exchanges\nThe number of shares of common stock issuable pursuant to the HotPlay Share Exchange and in connection with the Axion Preferred Conversion will cause significant dilution to existing stockholders and a change of control of the Company.\nPursuant to the HotPlay Share Exchange, following the completion of the HotPlay Share Exchange and at the time the outstanding shares of the Company\u2019s Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and Series C Convertible Preferred Stock automatically converts into common stock of the Company (anticipated to occur five days after the closing of the HotPlay Share Exchange), the current HotPlay securityholders are expected to own approximately 60.0% of the aggregate outstanding shares of common stock of Monaker, and the Axion Stockholders and Axion Creditors are expected to own approximately 13.0% of the aggregate outstanding common stock of Monaker (without taking into account shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Creditor Warrants), with the Monaker stockholders prior to the effective date of the closing and conversion holding approximately 27.1% of the aggregate outstanding common stock of the combined company (without taking into account shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Creditor Warrants). As a result, the total shares of common stock issuable upon closing of the HotPlay Share Exchange and in connection with the Axion Preferred Conversion will cause significant dilution to existing stockholders, and result in a change of control.\nThe Company has not yet been transferred the shares of Axion acquired pursuant to the closing of the Axion Share Exchange into its name.\nAlthough the Axion Share Exchange closed on November 16, 2020, the Company has yet to formally complete the transfer of the ownership of the Axion shares into its name, due to a Cease Trade Order issued by the British Columbia Securities Commission, which impacts Axion, and the Company may choose to not formally complete such transfer, but to instead obtain the contractual rights to vote and receive the economic rights to such shares, until such time as such shares can be formally transferred. In the event the transfer of the Axion shares is not approved, or delayed, the Company may be unable to take title to such shares, which could have adverse effects on the Company\u2019s accounting for such acquisition and may ultimately prevent the Company from recognizing the value of such shares. For example, as of February 28, 2021, the Company has accounted for its 33.85% interest in Axion as an investment in affiliate, valued at the aggregate liquidation preference of the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock issued in consideration for such shares of Axion, as ownership of such Axion shares have not yet been formally transferred to the Company. The Company may also be prohibited by the Cease Trade Order issued by the British Columbia Securities Commission to obtain the contractual rights to vote and receive the economic rights to the shares, and as such, may not be able to obtain the full value of such shares or account for such shares to their greatest value in the Company\u2019s financial statements moving forward. Currently the Company has no written agreements with the holders of the Axion shares acquired; however, the Company believes that such stockholders would, at the request of the Company, agree to vote such shares as requested by the Company from time to time.\nCombining HotPlay and the Company may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and the Company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the HotPlay Share Exchange, including expected financial and operating performance of the combined company.\nThe success of the HotPlay Share Exchange will depend, in part, on the combined company\u2019s ability to realize anticipated cost savings from combining the businesses of the Company and HotPlay. To realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from the HotPlay Share Exchange, the Company and HotPlay must successfully integrate and combine their businesses in a manner that permits those cost savings to be realized. If the Company and HotPlay are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the HotPlay Share Exchange may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual cost savings of the HotPlay Share Exchange could be less than anticipated.\nThe Company and HotPlay have operated and, until the completion of the HotPlay Share Exchange, must continue to operate independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the HotPlay Share Exchange. Integration efforts between the two companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of the Company and HotPlay during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the HotPlay Share Exchange on the combined company.\nThe combined company may be unable to retain Company and/or HotPlay personnel successfully after the HotPlay Share Exchange is completed.\nThe success of the HotPlay Share Exchange will depend in part on the combined company\u2019s ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees currently employed by the Company and HotPlay. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with the Company or HotPlay, as applicable, while the HotPlay Share Exchange is pending, or with the combined company after the HotPlay Share Exchange is consummated. If key employees terminate their employment, the combined company\u2019s business activities may be adversely affected and management\u2019s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating the Company and HotPlay to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause the combined company\u2019s business to suffer. In addition, the Company and HotPlay may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company.\nThe consummation of the HotPlay Share Exchange will result in a change of control of the Company.\nDue to the significant number of shares issuable at the closing of the HotPlay Share Exchange (i.e., 52,000,000 shares of Monaker common stock (currently representing approximately 60.0% of the shares of common stock which will be outstanding at closing, based on Monaker\u2019s current outstanding shares)), a change of control of the Company will be deemed to have occurred, and the owners of HotPlay prior to the HotPlay Share Exchange will obtain control of the Company (both as to the board of directors and voting control over the Company). Additionally, the HotPlay Exchange Agreement requires all but three of our current directors to resign and the appointment of four new directors, which are to be nominated by the principal stockholder of HotPlay, and such principal stockholder and Monaker are required to mutually agree on a seventh, eight and nineth director who will be independent, unless otherwise agreed by the parties (one of which is currently anticipated to be one of Monaker\u2019s current directors). Additionally, the new stockholders obtaining shares in the HotPlay Share Exchange will exercise control in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including the election and removal of directors, mergers, consolidations, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent or cause a further change in control. Any investors who purchase shares or hold shares prior to the HotPlay Share Exchange will be minority stockholders and as such will have little to no say in the direction of the Company and the election of directors. Additionally, it will be difficult if not impossible for investors to remove the directors appointed by the prior owners of HotPlay, which will mean they will remain in control of who serves as officers of the Company as well as whether any changes are made in the board of directors. An owner of the Company\u2019s securities should keep in mind that your shares, and your voting of such shares, will likely have little effect on the outcome of corporate decisions.\nUpon the closing of the HotPlay Share Exchange we plan to transition the majority of our business operations to those of HotPlay.\nWhile we plan to continue to operate in the travel industry, and through Longroot and our other ventures, following the closing of the HotPlay Share Exchange, we anticipate that the more significant portion of our assets and operations will be related to in-game advertising. We have no experience operating as an in-game advertising company and our operations in such industry will be subject to all of the risks of any new business in a new industry. Our change in business structure may not be successful. Additionally, such new controlling stockholders, directors and officers may not be able to properly manage our new direction. If our new management fails to properly manage and direct our operations, we may be forced to scale back or abandon our operations, which may cause the value of our common stock to decline or become worthless.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the HotPlay Share Exchange is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the HotPlay Share Exchange on employees and partners may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the HotPlay Share Exchange is completed, and could cause partners and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships, cease doing business with us or cause potential new partners to delay doing business with us until the HotPlay Share Exchange has been successfully completed or terminated. Retention of certain employees may be challenging during the pendency of the HotPlay Share Exchange, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles or compensation structure. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the business, our business following the HotPlay Share Exchange could be negatively impacted. In addition, the HotPlay Share Exchange restricts us from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the HotPlay Share Exchange is completed without certain consents and approvals. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the HotPlay Share Exchange.\nThe HotPlay Share Exchange limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the HotPlay Share Exchange.\nThe HotPlay Share Exchange contains provisions that could adversely impact competing proposals to acquire us. These provisions include the prohibition on us generally from soliciting any acquisition proposal or offer for a competing transaction. These provisions might discourage a third party that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of our company from considering or proposing an acquisition, even if that party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher value than the current proposed consideration payable pursuant to the HotPlay Share Exchange.\nThe HotPlay Exchange Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the HotPlay Share Exchange may not be completed.\nThe HotPlay Exchange Agreement is subject to several conditions that must be fulfilled in order to complete the HotPlay Share Exchange. These conditions to the closing of the HotPlay Share Exchange may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the HotPlay Share Exchange may not be completed. In addition, the parties to the HotPlay Exchange Agreement can generally terminate such agreement if the transactions contemplated thereby do not close by May 31, 2021, under certain other conditions if the terms of the HotPlay Share Exchange are breached, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the HotPlay Exchange Agreement at any time. In addition, the Company and the counterparties to the HotPlay Exchange Agreement may elect to terminate the HotPlay Exchange Agreement in certain other circumstances. The parties are fully committed to closing the HotPlay Share Exchange and the Company expects to extend the May 31, 2021 date, or otherwise continue to work together with HotPlay and the HotPlay Stockholders to close the HotPlay Share Exchange, following the date of this Report.\nLitigation could prevent or delay the closing of the HotPlay Share Exchange or otherwise negatively impact the business and operations of the Company.\nThe Company may incur costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any stockholder lawsuits filed in connection with the HotPlay Share Exchange. Such litigation could have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and could prevent or delay the consummation of the HotPlay Share Exchange. Such litigation, affecting HotPlay and/or the HotPlay Stockholders, could delay or prevent the closing of the HotPlay Share Exchange.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s warrant holders will need to approve the HotPlay Share Exchange or agree to modify such warrants, or such warrant holders will have the right to require the Company to repurchase such warrants upon the closing of the HotPlay Share Exchange.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s outstanding warrants agreements include provisions which allow such holders the right, following a fundamental transaction, such as the HotPlay Share Exchange, to require the Company to repurchase such securities at their Black Scholes values, which repurchase amounts may be significant and may be several times more than the exercise prices of such warrants, even if they are out-of-the-money. As a result, in the event such warrant holders do not consent to the HotPlay Share Exchange, exercise their warrants prior to the date of closing of the HotPlay Share Exchange, or otherwise agree to modify such warrants, the Company may be forced to expend significant resources repurchasing such warrants and the funding for such repurchases may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, and/or such conditions and requirements may ultimately prevent the HotPlay Share Exchange from closing.\nTermination of the HotPlay Share Exchange could negatively impact the Company.\nIn the event the HotPlay Share Exchange is terminated, our business may have been adversely impacted by our failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the HotPlay Share Exchange, and the market price of our common stock might decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the HotPlay Share Exchange will be completed. If the HotPlay Share Exchange is terminated and our board of directors seeks another acquisition or business combination, our stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration provided for by the HotPlay Share Exchange.\nThe combined company is required to re-meet the initial listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market in order to close the HotPlay Share Exchange.\nThe closing of the HotPlay Share Exchange requires that the Company requalify for initial listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market, pursuant to the applicable guidance and requirements of NASDAQ as of the date of the closing of the HotPlay Share Exchange. The NASDAQ Capital Market initial listing standards include more stringent requirements than The NASDAQ Capital Market continued listing standards. The NASDAQ Capital Market initial listing standards require that issuers meeting one of the following tests: (1) $750,000 of pre-tax income (in either the last fiscal year or two of the three most recent years), $5 million of public float, $4 million of stockholders\u2019 equity and a minimum closing price of $3 per share; (2) $15 million of public float, $5 million of stockholders\u2019 equity, a $3 per share price and 2 years of operating history; or (3) a $50 million market cap; $15 million of public float, $4 million of stockholders\u2019 equity, and a $2 per share price, plus in each case 300 round lot stockholders and 1,000,000 shares of total public float, with at least half of such required number of round lot stockholders holding unregistered securities with a minimum value of $2,500.\nWhile we believe that we will meet the initial listing requirements of NASDAQ following the closing of the HotPlay Share Exchange, if we cannot, we will not be able to close the HotPlay Share Exchange as currently contemplated.\nFailure to complete the HotPlay Share Exchange could negatively impact our stock price and future business and financial results.\nIf the HotPlay Share Exchange is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf we will not realize the benefits expected from the HotPlay Share Exchange, including a potentially enhanced competitive and financial position, expansion of assets and therefore opportunities, and will instead be subject to all the risks we currently face as an independent company;\n\u25cf we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and our partners and employees;\n\u25cf the HotPlay Share Exchange places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the HotPlay Share Exchange or the termination of the HotPlay Share Exchange. Such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of the counterparties to such agreement, may prevent us from making certain acquisitions, taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the HotPlay Share Exchange; and\n\u25cf matters relating to the HotPlay Share Exchange (including integration planning) may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which would otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.\nSignificant costs are expected to be incurred in connection with the consummation of the HotPlay Share Exchange and integration of the Company and HotPlay into a single business, including legal, accounting, financial advisory and other costs.\nIf the HotPlay Share Exchange is consummated, the Company and HotPlay expect to incur significant costs in connection with integrating their operations and personnel. These costs may include costs for:\n\u25cf employee redeployment, relocation or severance;\n\u25cf integration of information systems; and\n\u25cf reorganization or closures of facilities.\nIn addition, the Company and HotPlay expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies, which cannot be estimated accurately at this time. The Company and HotPlay will also incur transaction fees and other costs related to the HotPlay Share Exchange. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of the Company and HotPlay. Although the Company and HotPlay expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may offset incremental transaction and transaction-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. There can be no assurance that the Company and HotPlay will be successful in these integration efforts.\nThe conversion of the HotPlay Notes into common stock pursuant to their terms, will cause immediate and substantial dilution.\nIn certain situations, the HotPlay Notes automatically convert into common stock of the Company at a conversion price of $2.00 per share. If converted in full as of the date of this Report, without taking into account accrued interest, which also converts into common stock at a conversion price of $2.00 per share, HotPlay would be issued an aggregate of 7,500,000 shares of common stock (subject to the NASDAQ Limitation). Such issuance would result in immediate and substantial dilution to the interests of other stockholders.\nRisks Relating to Longroot Thailand\nCryptocurrency exchanges and other trading venues are relatively new.\nWhen cryptocurrency exchanges or other trading venues are involved in fraud or experience security failures or other operational issues, such events could result in a reduction in cryptocurrency prices, impact the success of Longroot Thailand and have a material adverse effect on the ability of Longroot Thailand to continue as a going concern, which correspondingly could harm the business, prospects and operations of the Company. Cryptocurrency market prices depend, directly or indirectly, on the prices set on exchanges and other trading venues, which are new and, in most cases, largely unregulated as compared to established, regulated exchanges for securities, commodities or currencies. In the event Longroot Thailand faces fraud, security failures, operational issues or similar events, such factors would have a material adverse effect on the ability of Longroot Thailand to continue as a going concern, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or operations of Longroot Thailand.\nLongroot Thailand\u2019s business may be adversely affected by market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investors.\nLongroot Thailand\u2019s revenues are derived from the participation in fundraising activities via the issuance of crypto tokens through its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) Portals. Uncertain economic and market conditions, and other poor geopolitical conditions, may adversely affect investor confidence and business activities of potential clients. This could result in declines in size and number of fundraises, which would likely negatively impact Longroot Thailand\u2019s results of operations.\nRegulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of the Company\u2019s ownership of Longroot Thailand or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects Longroot Thailand\u2019s business, prospects or operations.\nAs cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted differently to cryptocurrencies, with certain governments deeming them illegal while others have allowed their use and trade. Thailand, where Longroot Thailand is regulated, is the first country to approve a legal initial coin offering (\u201cICO\u201d) portal for issuers. Under Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cThai SEC\u201d) regulation, all crypto token issuances in Thailand must be approved by the Thai SEC and carried out via an approved ICO Portal such as Longroot Thailand. Governments may in the future take regulatory actions that prohibit or severely restrict the right to acquire, own, hold, sell, use or trade cryptocurrencies or to exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat currency. Similar actions by governments or regulatory bodies could impact the ability of Longroot Thailand to continue to operate and such actions could affect the ability of Longroot Thailand to continue as a going concern, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or operations of the Company.\nFurthermore, tokens issued by Longroot Thailand may be classified as securities depending on the nature of the token and the regulatory frameworks of the respective jurisdictions. Longroot Thailand\u2019s activities may be subject to securities regulations in different jurisdictions, which could limit its business activity, such as limits on the personnel it can issue tokens to, and this may negatively impact Longroot Thailand\u2019s profitability. In addition, compliance with existing laws and regulations, will involve significant amounts of time, including that of Longroot Thailand\u2019s senior leaders and that of dedicated compliance personnel, all of which might negatively impact Longroot Thailand\u2019s results of operations.\nThe development and acceptance of cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of and transactions in cryptocurrencies are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate.\nThe use of cryptocurrencies to, among other things, buy and sell goods and services and complete transactions, is part of a new and rapidly evolving industry that employs digital assets based upon a computer-generated mathematical and/or cryptographic protocol. The growth of this industry in general, and the use of cryptocurrencies in particular, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty, and the slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of developing protocols may occur and is unpredictable.\nLongroot Thailand\u2019s coins might be used for illegal or improper purposes, which could expose Longroot Thailand to additional liability and harm its business.\nLongroot Thailand\u2019s coins remain susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses as criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving internet services, such as money laundering, terrorist financing, drug trafficking, human trafficking, illegal online gaming, romance and other online scams, prohibited sales of pharmaceuticals, fraudulent sale of goods or services, piracy of software, movies, music and other copyrighted or trademarked goods, unauthorized uses of credit and debit cards or bank accounts and similar misconduct. Coinholders may also encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to engage in illegal activities. If the measures Longroot Thailand has taken are too restrictive and inadvertently screen proper transactions, this could diminish customer experience which could harm its business. Thailand\u2019s business could be harmed if customers use its system for illegal or improper purposes.\nAcceptance and/or widespread use of cryptocurrency is uncertain.\nCurrently, there is a relatively small use of cryptocurrencies in the retail and commercial marketplace for goods or services. In comparison, there is relatively large use by speculators contributing to price volatility. The relative lack of acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the retail and commercial marketplace limits the ability of end-users to use them to pay for goods and services. Such lack of acceptance or decline in acceptances would have a material adverse effect on the ability of Longroot Thailand to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or operations of Longroot Thailand and ultimately the Company.\nThere are cyber security risks related to cryptocurrency trading.\nTrading platforms and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to hacking or other malicious activity. As with any computer code generally, flaws in cryptocurrency codes may be exposed to such negative activities. Several errors and defects have been found previously, including those that disabled some functionality for users of cryptocurrency trading platforms and exposed such users\u2019 personal information. Flaws in and exploitations of the source code allowing malicious actors to take or create money have previously occurred. Any of the above events effecting Longroot Thailand may adversely affect its operations and results of operations and ultimately have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nCompeting blockchain platforms and technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers.\nThe development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies may cause consumers to use alternative distributed ledgers or an alternative to distributed ledgers altogether. This may adversely affect Longroot Thailand.\nFuture regulatory changes affecting Longroot Thailand are unable to predict.\nDigital assets in Thailand are regulated under the Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand, and are subject to comprehensive statutes, regulations and margin requirements. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand is authorized to take extraordinary actions in the event of a market emergency, including, for example, the retroactive implementation of speculative position limits or higher margin requirements, the establishment of daily price limits and the suspension of trading. The regulation of digital assets both inside and outside Thailand is a rapidly changing area of law and is subject to modification by government and judicial action. Digital assets also currently face an uncertain regulatory landscape in various jurisdictions. Various foreign jurisdictions may, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect digital assets and its users, particularly digital asset operators and service providers that fall within such jurisdictions\u2019 regulatory scope. Such laws, regulations or directives may conflict with those of Thailand and may negatively impact the acceptance of digital assets by users, merchants and service providers outside of Thailand and may therefore impede the growth of the digital asset economy. The effect of any future domestic or foreign regulatory change on the Longroot Thailand is unable to be predicted, but such change could be substantial and adverse to Longroot Thailand\u2019s operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to our Pending Acquisition of IFEB\nWe have paid a significant amount of cash to certain sellers of the IFEB Shares in connection with the proposed acquisition of the control of IFEB, which transaction may not be approved, and which consideration we have no ability to obtain the return of.\nAs described above under \u201cItem 1. Business-Recent Material Events-IFEB Bank Transaction\u201d, on April 1, 2021, we entered into the Bill of Sale with certain third parties pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase 2,191,489 shares of authorized and outstanding Class A Common Stock of IFEB, which IFEB Shares total approximately 57.1% of the outstanding Class A Common Stock of IFEB. The purchase price of the IFEB Shares was $6,400,000, which amount was paid to the sellers on April 1, 2021. Notwithstanding the terms of the Bill of the Sale, and the payment by the Company of the aggregate purchase price pursuant thereto, the transfer of the IFEB Shares to the Company and the Company\u2019s acquisition of control of IFEB is subject to review of the Company\u2019s financial viability, as well as other matters, by OCIF, and as such, the Company has filed a formal change of control application which must be approved before taking ownership and control of the IFEB Shares. The Company anticipates completing acquisition of the IFEB Shares in or around June 2021, however, the Company has no way of unwinding the transaction to purchase the IFEB Shares, or of obtaining the return of the $6,400,000 paid to the sellers in connection therewith if the transaction is not completed. The Company anticipates that if it is not able to obtain control of the IFEB Shares, it would attempt to sell such shares to a third party. Such sale may not be able to be completed on the same terms as the original proposed acquisition of the IFEB Shares by the Company, or at all. Any failure to complete the transfer of the IFEB Shares may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nCombining IFEB and the Company may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and the Company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of control of IFEB.\nThe success of the acquisition of control of IFEB will depend, in part, on the combined company\u2019s ability to realize anticipated cost savings from combining the businesses of the Company and IFEB. Combining IFEB and the Company may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and the Company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the planned acquisition of IFEB.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties until the acquisition of IFEB is completed.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Bill of Sale on employees and partners may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our and IFEB\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Bill of Sale are completed, and could cause partners and others that deal with us and IFEB to seek to change existing business relationships, cease doing business with us and IFEB or cause potential new partners to delay doing business with us and IFEB until the Bill of Sale transactions have been successfully completed. Retention of certain employees may be challenging during the pendency of the Bill of Sale, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles or compensation structure. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the business, our business following the Bill of Sale could be negatively impacted. In addition, the Exchange Agreements restrict us from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the Bill of Sale are completed without certain consents and approvals. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Bill of Sale.\nFailure to complete the acquisition of IFEB could negatively impact our stock price and future business and financial results.\nIf the acquisition of control of IFEB is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf we will not realize the benefits expected from the acquisition of control of IFEB, including a potentially enhanced competitive and financial position, expansion of assets and therefore opportunities, and will instead be subject to all the risks we currently face as an independent company;\n\u25cf we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and our partners and employees; and\n\u25cf matters relating to the acquisition of control of IFEB (including integration planning) may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which would otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.\nOur inability to fully integrate IFEB\u2019s business into our operations could adversely affect our operations or results.\nOur future growth and profitability depend on our ability to successfully integrate IFEB\u2019s banking operations into our operations. Integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly, sometimes including combining relevant accounting and data processing systems and management controls and policies, as well as managing relevant relationships with employees, clients, suppliers and other business partners. Integration efforts have diverted and could continue to divert management attention and resources, which could adversely affect our operations or results. The loss of key employees in connection with this acquisition could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct the combined operations. There can be no assurance that any of these executives will choose to continue working with us, or if they do, that we will be able to successfully integrate these executives as part of our management team in the combined business.\nThe acquisition of IFEB may result in business disruptions that cause IFEB to lose customers or cause customers to move their accounts or business to competing financial institutions. It is possible that the integration process related to the acquisition could disrupt our ongoing business or result in inconsistencies in customer service that could adversely affect IFEB\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees. Our inability to overcome these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. There is no assurance that our integration efforts will not result in other unanticipated costs.\nThe operations of IFEB are in a completely different industry than our current operations and we may not be successful in that new industry.\nIFEB was incorporated in 2017 as a corporation under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and received its international financial entity license on June 18, 2017 from the Office of the Commissioner of Financial Institutions of Puerto Rico, in Spanish, \u201cOficina del Comisionado de Instituciones Financieras\u201d, as license #51. As a result, IFEB is regulated by OCIF. Our officers do not have significant experience running a bank and we may not be profitable in this new line of business, assuming the acquisition of control of IFEB is approved. Even if we achieve profitability in the future by adopting this new business strategy, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. The operation of IFEB may subject us to unknown costs, liabilities, regulations and expenses which we haven\u2019t budgeted for and we may ultimately be unsuccessful in this new line of business in the event the acquisition of IFEB is approved.\nRisks Related to Monaker\u2019s Common Stock\nStockholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock.\nWherever possible, our board of directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash consideration will consist of restricted shares of our common stock or where shares are to be issued to our officers, directors and applicable consultants, free trading shares pursuant to Form S-8 registration statements. Our board of directors has authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to the market price of such securities. These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders, which may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management\u2019s ability to maintain control of the Company because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management.\nNevada law and our Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue shares of common and preferred stock, which shares may cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nWe have authorized capital stock consisting of 500,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.00001 par value per share, 3,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share, 10,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, $0.00001 par value per share and 3,828,500 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, $ 0.00001 par value per share. As of the date of this Report, we have 23,454,203 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, 10,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, and 3,828,500 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, issued and outstanding. As a result, our board of directors can issue a large number of additional shares of common stock and/or effect a reverse stock split, without stockholder approval, and if additional shares are issued, it could cause substantial dilution to our then stockholders. Additionally, shares of preferred stock may be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval with voting powers, and such preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special rights and powers as determined by our board of directors, which may be greater than the shares of common stock currently outstanding. As a result, shares of preferred stock may be issued by our board of directors which cause the holders to have super-majority voting power over our shares, provide the holders of the preferred stock the right to convert the shares of preferred stock they hold into shares of our common stock, which may cause substantial dilution to our then common stock stockholders and/or have other rights and preferences greater than those of our common stock stockholders. Investors should keep in mind that the board of directors has the authority to issue additional shares of common stock and preferred stock, which could cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders. Additionally, the dilutive effect of any preferred stock, which we may issue may be exacerbated given the fact that such preferred stock may have super-majority voting rights and/or other rights or preferences which could provide the preferred stockholders with voting control over us subsequent to this offering and/or give those holders the power to prevent or cause a change in control. As a result, the issuance of shares of common stock and/or preferred stock may cause the value of our securities to decrease and/or become worthless.\nThe outstanding Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock have a liquidation preference on parity with our common stock.\nIf the HotPlay Share Exchange is not completed, the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, will not be convertible into common stock. If that were to occur Monaker would likely hold another special or annual meeting of stockholders to again request approval for such conversions/exercise separate from the HotPlay Share Exchange, if necessary or required; provided that until converted in full, such Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock, which have a liquidation preference of $9,272,121 and $7,657,000, respectively, will remain outstanding, and will, upon any liquidation of Monaker, reduce pro-rata, the amount of any consideration that the common stock stockholders of Monaker would receive upon liquidation of Monaker.\nOur outstanding warrants may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nAs of the date of this Report, there were outstanding warrants to purchase 1,131,671 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $3.34 per share, not including the creditor warrants. For the life of the warrants, the holders have the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock without assuming the risk of ownership. The issuance of shares upon the exercise of outstanding securities will also dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.\nThe availability of these shares for public resale, as well as any actual resales of these shares, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of outstanding options or warrants or conversion of other securities, or the effect if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock may have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nCertain warrants we have granted include anti-dilutive rights\nThe warrants to purchase 724,000 shares of common stock which we granted to certain purchases in our October 2018 offering (of which warrants to purchase 527,400 shares are currently outstanding) include anti-dilution rights, which provide that if at any time while the warrants are outstanding, we issue or are deemed to have issued (which includes shares issuable upon exercise of warrants and options and conversion of convertible securities) securities for consideration less than the then current exercise price of the warrants, subject to certain excepted issuances, the exercise price of such warrants is automatically reduced to the lowest price per share of consideration provided or deemed to have been provided for such securities, not to be less than $0.57 per share (subject to adjustment for reverse and forward stock splits, recapitalizations and similar transactions). The warrants which originally had an exercise price of $2.85 per share currently have any exercise price of $2.00 per share as a result of our April 2019 underwritten offering.\nOur Common Stock may be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market if we cannot satisfy Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements.\nAmong the conditions required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, Nasdaq requires us to maintain at least $2.5 million in stockholders\u2019 equity or $500,000 in net income over the prior two years or two of the prior three years, to have a majority of independent directors, and to maintain a stock price over $1.00 per share. As of the date of this Report, our stockholders\u2019 equity is above Nasdaq\u2019s $2.5 million minimum and, we have maintained our stock price over $1.00 per share (provided that our stock price traded as low as $0.61 during calendar 2020).\nMoving forward, we may not be able to maintain at least $2.5 million in stockholders\u2019 equity, may not generate over $500,000 of yearly net income, we may not be able to maintain independent directors, we may not be able to maintain a stock price over $1.00 per share and/or may not be able to meet the requirements related to the number of independent directors on our board of directors and/or hold an annual meeting of stockholders on a timely basis. If we fail to timely comply with the applicable requirements, and/or to timely cure the deficiencies described above, our stock may be delisted. In addition, even if we demonstrate compliance with the requirements above, we will have to continue to meet other objective and subjective listing requirements to continue to be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market could make trading our common stock more difficult for investors, potentially leading to declines in our share price and liquidity. Without a Nasdaq Capital Market listing, stockholders may have a difficult time getting a quote for the sale or purchase of our stock, the sale or purchase of our stock would likely be made more difficult and the trading volume and liquidity of our stock could decline. Delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market could also result in negative publicity and could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. The absence of such a listing may adversely affect the acceptance of our common stock as currency or the value accorded by other parties. Further, if we are delisted, we would also incur additional costs under state blue sky laws in connection with any sales of our securities. These requirements could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock in the secondary market. If our common stock is delisted by Nasdaq, our common stock may be eligible to trade on an over-the-counter quotation system, such as the OTCQB market, where an investor may find it more difficult to sell our stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. In the event our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, we may not be able to list our common stock on another national securities exchange or obtain a quotation on an over-the-counter quotation system.\nIf we are delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, your ability to sell your shares of our common stock could also be limited by the penny stock restrictions, which could further limit the marketability of your shares.\nIf our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, it could come within the definition of \u201cpenny stock\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act and would then be covered by Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act. That Rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, Rule 15g-9, if it were to become applicable, would affect the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell our securities, and accordingly would affect the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the public market. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nDue to the fact that our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we are subject to financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements which increase our costs and expenses.\nWe are currently required to file annual and quarterly information and other reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission that are specified in Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Additionally, due to the fact that our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, we are also subject to the requirements to maintain independent directors, comply with other corporate governance requirements, and are required to pay annual listing and stock issuance fees. These obligations require a commitment of additional resources including, but not limited, to additional expenses, and may result in the diversion of our senior management\u2019s time and attention from our day-to-day operations. These obligations increase our expenses and may make it more complicated or time-consuming for us to undertake certain corporate actions because we may require Nasdaq approval for such transactions and/or Nasdaq rules that may require us to obtain stockholder approval for such transactions.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, the risk factors described herein and other factors beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock could include:\n\u25cf variations in our operating results;\n\u25cf variations in operating results of similar companies and competitors;\n\u25cf changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u25cf changes in our outlook for future operating results which are communicated to investors and analysts;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations, new products, services or service enhancements, strategic alliances or agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u25cf marketing and advertising initiatives by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf the increase or decrease of listings;\n\u25cf threatened or actual litigation;\n\u25cf changes in our management;\n\u25cf recruitment or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf market conditions in our industry, the travel industry and the economy as a whole;\n\u25cf the overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u25cf sales of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders;\n\u25cf global pandemics and epidemics, such as COVID-19;\n\u25cf the reports of industry research analysts who cover our competitors and us;\n\u25cf stock-based compensation expense under applicable accounting standards; and\n\u25cf adoption or modification of regulations, policies, procedures or programs applicable to our business.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations and general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance. Each of these factors, among others, could harm the value of our common stock.\nIn the past, many companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation; and we have previously been the target of this type of litigation. Securities litigation against us, regardless of the merits or outcome, could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could materially harm our business.\nIf the holders of our common stock sell a large number of shares all at once or in blocks, the market price of our shares would most likely decline.\nCertain of our stockholders and warrant holders hold shares of common stock that are freely tradable and/or freely tradable upon exercise. Should such holders decide to sell their shares at a price below the market price as quoted on NASDAQ, or any exchange on which our common stock might be listed in the future, the price may continue to decline. A steep decline in the price of our common stock upon being quoted on NASDAQ, or any exchange on which our common stock might be listed in the future, would adversely affect our ability to raise additional equity capital, and even if we were successful in raising such capital, the terms of such raise may be substantially dilutive to current stockholders.\nIf securities analysts and other industry experts do not publish research or publish negative research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research, reports and other media that securities analysts and other industry experts publish about us or our business. If security analysts don\u2019t cover our stock, downgrade our stock or publish negative research about our business, our stock price could decline. If analysts do not cover us in the future, cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the stock market and demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. If one or more industry analysts publish negative statements about our business, our stock price could decline.\nFailure to adequately manage our growth may seriously harm our business.\nWe plan to grow our business as rapidly as possible. If we do not effectively manage our growth, the quality of our services may suffer, which could negatively affect our reputation and demand for our services. Our growth may place a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, and financial resources and our infrastructure. Our future success will depend, in part, upon the ability of our senior management to manage growth effectively. This will require us to, among other things:\n\u25cf implement additional management information systems;\n\u25cf further develop our operating, administrative, legal, financial, and accounting systems and controls;\n\u25cf hire additional personnel;\n\u25cf develop additional levels of management within our company;\n\u25cf locate additional office space;\n\u25cf maintain close coordination among our operations, legal, finance, sales and marketing, and client service and support teams; and\n\u25cf manage our expanding international operations.\nAs a result, we may lack the resources to deploy our services on a timely and cost-effective basis. Failure to accomplish any of these requirements could impair our ability to deliver services in a timely fashion or attract and retain new customers.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. If we do not pay cash dividends, our stockholders could receive a return on their investment in our common stock only if the market price of our common stock has increased when they sell their shares.\nOur incorporation documents and Nevada law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also limit the market price of our common stock, which may inhibit an attempt by our stockholders to change our direction or management.\nNevada law and our articles of incorporation contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our Company. Some of these provisions include the following:\n\u25cf authorize our board of directors to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to, or imposed upon, the preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series without further action by our stockholders; and\n\u25cf prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates.\nThese and other provisions in our articles of incorporation, as amended, and under Nevada law could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions. Furthermore, these provisions may inhibit an attempt by our stockholders to change our direction or management.\nWe adopted provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation limiting the liability of management to stockholders.\nWe have adopted provisions, and will maintain provisions, to our amended and restated articles of incorporation that limit the liability of our directors, and provide for indemnification by us of our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Nevada law. Our Articles of Incorporation and Nevada law provide that directors have no personal liability to third parties for monetary damages for actions taken as a director, except for breach of duty of loyalty, acts or omissions not in good faith involving intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, unlawful payment of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases, or transactions from which the director derived improper personal benefit. Such provisions limit the stockholders\u2019 ability to hold directors liable for breaches of fiduciary duty and reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers.\nIf we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our ability to compete could be impaired.\nOur intellectual property includes the content of our websites, registered domain names, as well as registered and unregistered trademarks. We believe that our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business and that our domain names and our technology infrastructure currently give us a competitive advantage in the online market for ALR listings and cryptocurrency. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our brand, reputation and perceived content value could be harmed, resulting in an impaired ability to compete effectively.\nTo protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws, contractual provisions and our user policy and restrictions on disclosure. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we promptly take action we deem appropriate to protect our rights. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner. The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and, despite these precautions, it may be possible for other parties to copy or otherwise obtain and use the content of our websites without authorization. We may be unable to prevent competitors from acquiring domain names or trademarks that are similar to, infringe upon or diminish the value of our domain names, service marks and our other proprietary rights. Even if we do detect violations and decide to enforce our intellectual property rights, litigation may be necessary to enforce our rights, and any enforcement efforts we undertake could be time-consuming, expensive, distracting and result in unfavorable outcomes. A failure to protect our intellectual property in a cost-effective and meaningful manner could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete.\nEffective trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available over the Internet. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain and still evolving.\nWe may be subject to claims that we violated intellectual property rights of others, which are extremely costly to defend and could require us to pay significant damages and limit our ability to operate.\nCompanies in the Internet and technology industries, and other patent and trademark holders seeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. There may be intellectual property rights held by others, including issued or pending patents and trademarks, that cover significant aspects of our technologies, content, branding or business methods. Any intellectual property claims against us, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert our management\u2019s attention and other resources. These claims also could subject us to significant liability for damages and could result in our having to stop using technology, content, branding or business methods found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights. We might be required or may opt to seek a license for rights to intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot license or develop technology, content, branding or business methods for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business, we may be unable to compete effectively. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which could increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, content, branding or business methods, which could require significant effort and expense and be inferior. Any of these results could harm our operating results.\nUncertainty and illiquidity in credit and capital markets can impair our ability to obtain credit and financing on acceptable terms and can adversely affect the financial strength of our business partners.\nOur ability to obtain credit and capital depends in large measure on the state of the credit and capital markets, which is beyond our control. Our ability to access credit and capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, access to those markets, which could constrain our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. In addition, the cost and availability of debt and equity financing may be adversely impacted by unstable or illiquid market conditions. Protracted uncertainty and illiquidity in these markets also could have an adverse impact on our lenders or our customers, preventing them from meeting their obligations to us.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain necessary funds from financing activities. Uncertainty and illiquidity in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions to fund their commitments to us under our liquidity facilities. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our liquidity facilities to satisfy our cash requirements, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.\nFuture litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and may be involved in governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business. Many of these matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties and complexities. The timing of the final resolutions to these types of matters is often uncertain. Additionally, the possible outcomes or resolutions to these matters could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments, adversely affecting our results of operations and liquidity.\nChanges in our effective tax rate could harm our future operating results.\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by several circumstances, including:\n\u25cf earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates;\n\u25cf effects of certain non-tax-deductible expenses;\n\u25cf changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u25cf transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our intercompany research and development cost sharing arrangement and legal structure;\n\u25cf adverse outcomes resulting from any tax audit;\n\u25cf our ability to utilize our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets; and\n\u25cf changes in accounting principles or changes in tax laws and regulations, or the application of the tax laws and regulations, including possible U.S. changes to the deductibility of expenses attributable to foreign income, or the foreign tax credit rules.\nSignificant judgment is required in the application of accounting guidance relating to uncertainty in income taxes. If tax authorities challenge our tax positions and any such challenges are settled unfavorably, it could adversely impact our provision for income taxes.\nOur websites may encounter technical problems and service interruptions.\nOur websites may in the future experience slower response times or interruptions as a result of increased traffic or other reasons. These delays and interruptions resulting from failure to maintain Internet service connections to our site could frustrate visitors and reduce our future web site traffic, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we do not successfully implement any acquisition strategies, our operating results and prospects could be harmed.\nWe face competition within our industry for acquisitions of businesses, technologies and assets, and, in the future, such competition may become more intense. As such, even if we are able to identify an acquisition that we would like to consummate, we may not be able to complete the acquisition on commercially reasonable terms or at all because of such competition. Furthermore, if we enter into negotiations that are not ultimately consummated, those negotiations could result in the diversion of management time and significant out-of-pocket costs. Even if we are able to complete such acquisitions, we may additionally expend significant amounts of cash or incur substantial debt to finance them, which indebtedness could result in restrictions on our business and use of available cash. In addition, we may finance or otherwise complete acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which could result in dilution of our existing stockholders. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions successfully, we may not be able to realize their benefits. If we are unable to successfully address any of these risks, our business, financial condition or operating results could be harmed.\nBecause we are a small company, the requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company with listed equity securities, we must comply with the federal securities laws, rules and regulations, including certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, related rules and regulations of the SEC, with which a private company is not required to comply. Complying with these laws, rules and regulations will occupy a significant amount of time of our directors and management and will significantly increase our costs and expenses, which we cannot estimate accurately at this time. Among other things, we must:\n\u25cf establish and maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u25cf prepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws;\n\u25cf maintain various internal compliance and disclosures policies, such as those relating to disclosure controls and procedures and insider trading in our common stock;\n\u25cf involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities;\n\u25cf maintain a comprehensive internal audit function; and\n\u25cf maintain an investor relations function.\nIn addition, being a public company subject to these rules and regulations may require us to accept less director and officer liability insurance coverage than we desire or to incur substantial costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors.", "PERMNO": 17324, "SIC": 4700, "TIC": "MKGI"}
