In addition to the other information in this Annual Report and our other filings with the SEC, you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not specified herein, not currently known to us, or currently deemed to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows.\nAny one of these factors or a combination of these factors could materially affect our future results of operations and could influence whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required to do so.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe may not have sufficient liquidity to sustain operations because of net losses, working capital deficits, and other factors, including an adverse change in our relationship with Genesis and GEL, crude supply issues, and financial covenant defaults in secured loan agreements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we reported a net loss of $15,767,448, or a loss of $1.51 per share, compared to net income of $4,403,239, or income of $0.42 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2015. This represented a decrease of 1.93 per share between the periods. We had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (current portion) of $1,152,628 and $3,347,835, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Comparatively, we had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (current portion) of $1,853,875 and $3,175,299, respectively, at December 31, 2015.\nWe had a working capital deficit of $37,812,263 at December 31, 2016 compared to a working capital deficit of $598,807 at December 31, 2015. The significant increase in working capital deficit between the periods primarily related to reclassification of secured long-term debt (and the related debt issue costs) with Sovereign to the current portion within long-term debt. Excluding long-term debt, we had a working capital deficit of $6,099,927 at December 31, 2016. Comparatively, we had a working capital deficit of $598,807 at December 31, 2015. This represented a decrease in working capital of $5,501,120 between the periods. The decrease in working capital was primarily the result of sustaining net losses in 2016 compared to net income in 2015. Net losses in 2016 resulted from lower margins on refined petroleum products, lower refinery throughput and significant refinery downtime, higher refinery operating expenses, and income tax expense. Margins on refined petroleum products decreased primarily because of lower crack spreads.\nWe are currently in a contract-related dispute with GEL. The adverse change in our relationship with Genesis and GEL has had a material adverse effect on our operations, liquidity, and financial condition. In addition, the contract related dispute has affected our ability to obtain financings, prevented us from taking advantage of business opportunities, disrupted normal business operations, and diverted management\u2019s focus away from operations. We expect these effects to continue until the dispute is resolved. As a result of the contract-related dispute, we ceased purchases of crude oil and condensate from GEL in November 2016, and we began using an alternate crude oil and condensate supplier. As a result, we currently do not have a long-term crude supply agreement in place. We are unable to predict the outcome of the current proceedings with Genesis and GEL or their ultimate impact, if any, on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, an unfavorable resolution of the dispute could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and financial condition and results of operations. (Within this \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d section, see also \u201cRisks Related to Our Refining Operations\u201d for a discussion of risks related to our operations being dependent on our relationship with Genesis and GEL.)\nBLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY\nFORM 10-K\nAt December 31, 2016, we were in violation of certain financial covenants in secured loan agreements with Sovereign. Consequently, Sovereign is permitted to declare the amounts owed under these loan agreements immediately due and payable, exercise its rights with respect to collateral securing our obligations under these loan agreements, and/or exercise any other rights and remedies available. Although Sovereign waived the financial covenant defaults as of December 31, 2016, the debt associated with these loans was classified within the current portion of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016 due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet the financial covenants in the future. There can be no assurance that Sovereign will provide future waivers, which may have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. (Within this \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d section, see also \u201cRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\u201d for a discussion of risks related to our financial covenant defaults with Sovereign.)\nWe are currently working to improve our operating performance and our cash, liquidity and financial position. This includes: executing on our business strategies to improve operating performance, exploring alternative funding sources for the purchase of crude oil and condensate, secure new financing to meet ongoing liquidity needs, attempting to negotiate alternative payment terms with creditors, obtaining waivers for financial covenant violations, and pursuing the sale of non-strategic surplus land. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise secure sufficient liquidity to support our short-term and long-term capital requirements, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations or pursue our business strategies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity. Our short-term working capital needs are primarily related to acquisition of crude oil and condensate to operate the Nixon Facility, repayment of debt obligations, and capital expenditures for maintenance, upgrades, and refurbishment of equipment at the Nixon Facility. Our long-term working capital needs are primarily related to repayment of long-term debt obligations. In addition, we continue to utilize capital to reduce operational, safety and environmental risks. We may incur substantial compliance costs in connection with any new environmental, health and safety regulations. Our liquidity will affect our ability to satisfy any of these needs.\nThe dangers inherent in oil and gas operations could expose us to potentially significant losses, costs or liabilities and reduce our liquidity.\nOil and gas operations are inherently subject to significant hazards and risks. These hazards and risks include, but are not limited to, fires, explosions, ruptures, blowouts, spills, third-party interference and equipment failure, any of which could result in interruption or termination of operations, pollution, personal injury and death, or damage to our assets and the property of others. These risks could harm our reputation and business, result in claims against us, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe geographic concentration of our assets creates a significant exposure to the risks of the regional economy and other regional adverse conditions.\nOur primary operating asset, the Nixon Facility, is in Nixon, Texas in the Eagle Ford Shale and we market our refined petroleum products in a single, relatively limited geographic area. In addition, our onshore facilities assets are in Freeport, Texas, and all our pipelines, offshore facilities and oil and gas properties are located within the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, our operations are more susceptible to regional economic conditions than our more geographically diversified competitors. Any changes in market conditions, unforeseen circumstances, or other events affecting the area in which our assets are located could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These factors include, among other things, changes in the economy, weather conditions, demographics, and population.\nCompetition from companies having greater financial and other resources could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe refining industry is highly competitive. Our refining operations compete with domestic refiners and marketers in PADD 3 (Gulf Coast), domestic refiners in other PADD regions, and foreign refiners that import products into the U.S. Certain of our competitors have larger, more complex refineries and may be able to realize higher margins per barrel of production. Several of our principal competitors are integrated national or international oil companies that are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do and have access to proprietary sources of controlled crude oil production. Unlike these competitors, we obtain all of our feedstocks from a single supplier. Because of their integrated operations and larger capitalization, larger, more complex refineries may be more flexible in responding to volatile industry or market conditions, such as crude oil and other feedstocks supply shortages or commodity price fluctuations. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose existing customers or fail to acquire new customers.\nBLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY\nFORM 10-K\nEnvironmental laws and regulations could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to remain in compliance or to remediate current or future contamination that could give rise to material liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the emission or discharge of pollutants into the environment, product specifications and the generation, treatment, storage, transportation, disposal and remediation of solid and hazardous wastes. Violations of these laws and regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial penalties, injunctive orders compelling installation of additional controls, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns.\nIn addition, new environmental laws and regulations, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, increased governmental enforcement of laws and regulations, or other developments could require us to make additional unforeseen expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent, and the cost of compliance with these requirements can be expected to increase over time. The requirements to be met, as well as the technology and length of time available to meet those requirements, continue to develop and change. Expenditures or costs for environmental compliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and profitability.\nThe Nixon Facility operates under several federal and state permits, licenses, and approvals with terms and conditions that contain a significant number of prescriptive limits and performance standards. These permits, licenses, approvals, limits, and standards require a significant amount of monitoring, record keeping and reporting to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit, license, approval, limit or standard. Non-compliance or incomplete documentation of our compliance status may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive relief. Additionally, there may be times when we are unable to meet the standards and terms and conditions of our permits, licenses and approvals due to operational upsets or malfunctions, which may lead to the imposition of fines and penalties or operating restrictions that may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our facilities, and accordingly our financial performance.\nWe are subject to strict laws and regulations regarding personnel and process safety, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and profitability.\nWe are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers, and the proper design, operation and maintenance of our equipment. In addition, OSHA and certain environmental regulations require that we maintain information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that we provide this information to personnel and state and local governmental authorities. Failure to comply with these requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring and control of occupational exposure to regulated substances, may result in significant fines or compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur insurance policies may be inadequate or expensive.\nOur insurance coverage does not cover all potential losses, costs or liabilities. We could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts more than our existing insurance coverage. Our ability to obtain and maintain adequate insurance may be affected by conditions in the insurance market over which we have no control. In addition, if we experience insurable events, we may experience an increase in annual premiums, a limit on coverage, or loss of coverage. Inadequate insurance or loss of coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nBLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY\nFORM 10-K\nLEH holds a significant interest in us, and our related party transactions with LEH and its affiliates may cause conflicts of interest that may adversely affect us.\nJonathan P. Carroll, our Chief Executive Officer, President, Assistant Treasurer and Secretary, is also a majority owner of LEH. LEH owns approximately 81% of our Common Stock, and, pursuant to the Operating Agreement, manages and operates all our properties. LEH and Mr. Carroll have significant influence over matters such as the election of our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), control over our business, policies and affairs and other matters submitted to our stockholders. LEH and Mr. Carroll are entitled to vote the Common Stock owned by LEH in accordance with its interests, which may be contrary to the interests of other stockholders. LEH has interests that may differ from the interests of other stockholders and, as a result, there is a risk that important business decisions will not be made in the best interest of some of our stockholders.\nLEH and its affiliates are not limited in their ability to compete with us and are not obligated to offer us business opportunities. We believe that the transactions and agreements that we have entered with LEH and its affiliates are on terms that are at least as favorable as could reasonably have been obtained at such time from third-parties. However, these relationships could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our Board is faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and LEH or its affiliates. The appearance of conflicts, even if such conflicts do not materialize, might adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of us, as well as our relationship with other companies and our ability to enter new relationships in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business.\nWe are in violation of certain financial covenants in secured loan agreements with Sovereign, and our failure to comply could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2016, we were in violation of certain financial covenants in secured loan agreements with Sovereign. Consequently, Sovereign is permitted to declare the amounts owed under these loan agreements immediately due and payable, exercise its rights with respect to collateral securing our obligations under these loan agreements, and/or exercise any other rights and remedies available. Sovereign waived the financial covenant defaults as of December 31, 2016. However, $31,680,911 of debt associated with these loans was classified within the current portion of long-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016, due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet the financial covenants in the future.\nThere can be no assurance that: (i) our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding long-term debt, either upon maturity or if accelerated, (ii) we would be able to refinance or restructure the payments on the long-term debt, and/or (iii) Sovereign will provide future waivers of covenant defaults. If we fail to comply with financial covenants associated with certain of our long-term debt and such failure is not cured or waived, then Sovereign may exercise any rights and remedies available under the loan agreement(s). Any such action by Sovereign would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to continue as a going concern. (See \u201cPart II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note (10), Long-Term Debt, Net and Note (21) Subsequent Events\u201d for additional disclosures related to our long-term debt and financial covenant violations.)\nOur ability to use net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes is subject to limitation.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cIRC Section 382\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income. Within the meaning of IRC Section 382, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs when the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5% shareholders, applying certain look-through rules) increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders' lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years).\nBLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY\nFORM 10-K\nBlue Dolphin experienced ownership changes in 2005 in connection with a series of private placements, and in 2012 because of a reverse acquisition. The 2012 ownership change limits our ability to utilize NOLs following the 2005 ownership change that were not previously subject to limitation. Limitations imposed on our ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income could cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect, and could cause such NOLs to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such NOLs. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. NOLs generated after the 2012 ownership change are not subject to limitation.\nAt December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $0 and approximately $8.3 million, respectively, in deferred tax assets. As of each reporting date, management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2016. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as our projections for future growth. Based on this evaluation, we recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016.\nTerrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, threats of war, or actual war may negatively affect our operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nEnergy-related assets in the U.S. may be at a greater risk for future terrorist attacks than other potential targets. A direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, any terrorist attack in the U.S. could have an adverse impact on energy prices, including prices for crude oil and refined petroleum products, and refining margins. Disruption or significant increases in energy prices could result in government imposed price controls. While we currently maintain some insurance that provides coverage against terrorist attacks, such insurance has become increasingly expensive and difficult to obtain. As a result, insurance providers may not continue to offer this coverage to us on terms that we consider affordable, or at all.\nOur operations are dependent on our technology infrastructure, which includes a data network, telecommunications system, internet access, and various computer hardware equipment and software applications. Our technology infrastructure is subject to damage or interruption from several potential sources, including natural disasters, software viruses or other malware, power failures, cyber-attacks, and/or other events. To the extent that our technology infrastructure is under our control, we have implemented measures such as virus protection software and emergency recovery processes to address identified risks. However, there can be no assurance that a security breach or cyber-attack will not compromise confidential, business critical information, cause a disruption in our operations, or harm our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Refining Operations\nManagement has determined that there is, and the report of our independent registered public accounting firm expresses, substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur auditors, UHY LLP, have indicated in their report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to recurring losses from operations and the substantial decline in working capital. A \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale of equity, incurring debt, or other financing alternatives. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend upon improved operating margins, the most significant driver of which is crack spreads, the availability and terms of financing for working capital to operate the Nixon Facility, purchase crude oil and condensate, and fund capital expenditures, and resolution of the contract-related dispute with GEL. If we are unable to achieve these goals, our business would be jeopardized and we may not be able to continue.\nBLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY\nFORM 10-K\nRefining margins are volatile, and a reduction in refining margins will adversely affect the amount of cash we will have available for working capital.\nHistorically, refining margins have been volatile, and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Our financial results are primarily affected by the relationship, or margin, between our refined petroleum product sales prices and our crude oil and condensate costs. Our crude oil and condensate acquisition costs and the prices at which we can ultimately sell our refined petroleum products depend upon numerous factors beyond our control.\nThe prices at which we sell refined petroleum products are strongly influenced by the commodity price of crude oil. If crude oil prices increase, our \u201crefinery operations\u201d business segment margins will fall unless we can pass along these price increases to our wholesale customers. Increases in the selling prices for refined petroleum products typically trail the rising cost of crude oil and may be difficult to implement when crude oil costs increase dramatically over a short period.\nThe price volatility of crude oil, other feedstocks, refined petroleum products, and fuel and utility services may have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur refining earnings, cash flows and liquidity from operations depend primarily on the margin above operating expenses (including the cost of refinery feedstocks, such as crude oil and condensate that are processed and blended into refined petroleum products) at which we can sell refined petroleum products. Crude oil refining is primarily a margin-based business. To improve margins, it is important for a crude oil refinery to maximize the yields of high value finished petroleum produces and to minimize the costs of feedstocks and operating expenses. When the margin between refined petroleum product prices and crude oil and other feedstock costs decreases, our margins are negatively affected. Crude oil refining margins have historically been volatile, and are likely to continue to be volatile, because of a variety of factors, including fluctuations in the prices of crude oil, other feedstocks, refined petroleum products, and fuel and utility services. While an increase or decrease in the price of crude oil may result in a similar increase or decrease in prices for refined petroleum products, there may be a time lag in the realization of the similar increase or decrease in prices for refined petroleum products. The effect of changes in crude oil and condensate prices on our refining margins therefore depends, in part, on how quickly and how fully refined petroleum product prices adjust to reflect these changes.\nPrices of crude oil, other feedstocks and refined petroleum products depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of and demand for crude oil, other feedstocks, and refined petroleum products. Such supply and demand are affected by, among other things:\n\u25cf\nchanges in foreign, domestic, and local economic conditions;\n\u25cf\nforeign and domestic demand for fuel products;\n\u25cf\nworldwide political conditions, particularly in significant oil producing regions;\n\u25cf\nforeign and domestic production levels of crude oil, other feedstocks, and refined petroleum products and the volume of crude oil, feedstocks, and refined petroleum products imported into the U.S.;\n\u25cf\navailability of and access to transportation infrastructure;\n\u25cf\ncapacity utilization rates of refineries in the U.S.;\n\u25cf\nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries\u2019 influence on oil prices;\n\u25cf\ndevelopment and marketing of alternative and competing fuels;\n\u25cf\ncommodities speculation;\n\u25cf\nnatural disasters (such as hurricanes and tornadoes), accidents, interruptions in transportation, inclement weather or other events that can cause unscheduled shutdowns or otherwise adversely affect our refineries;\n\u25cf\nfederal and state governmental regulations and taxes; and\nBLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY\nFORM 10-K\n\u25cf\nlocal factors, including market conditions, weather conditions and the level of operations of other refineries and pipelines in our markets.\nOur future success depends on our ability to acquire sufficient levels of crude oil on favorable terms to operate the Nixon Facility.\nOperation of the Nixon Facility depends on our ability to purchase adequate crude supplies on favorable terms. We are currently involved in a contract-related dispute with GEL related to the Crude Supply Agreement. In connection with this dispute, GEL significantly under-delivered crude oil and condensate to the Nixon Facility during 2016 resulting in 59 days of refinery downtime. To mitigate the impact of GEL\u2019s disruption of crude Supply to the Nixon Facility, we entered a month-to-month evergreen crude oil supply contract with a major integrated oil and gas company in June 2016, as back-up to the Crude Supply Agreement. We ceased purchases of crude oil and condensate from GEL in November 2016, and we began using an alternate crude oil and condensate supplier. We believe that adequate supplies of crude oil and condensate for the Nixon Facility will continue to be available to us from the alternate supplier. We are working to put a long-term crude supply agreement in place, however, our ability to purchase crude oil and condensate is dependent on our liquidity and access to capital, which have been adversely affected by net losses, working capital deficits, the contract-related dispute with GEL, and financial covenant defaults in secured loan agreements.\nWe are pursuing alternative sources to finance crude oil and condensate acquisition costs, including commodity sale and repurchase programs, inventory financing, debt financing, equity financing, or other means. We may not be successful in consummating suitable financing transactions in the time required or at all, securing financing on terms favorable to us, or obtaining crude oil and condensate at the levels needed to earn a profit and/or safely operate the Nixon Facility, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDowntime at the Nixon Facility could result in lost margin opportunity, increased maintenance expense, increased inventory, and a reduction in cash available for payment of our obligations.\nThe safe and reliable operation of the Nixon Facility is key to our financial performance and results of operations, and we are particularly vulnerable to disruptions in our operations because all our refining operations are conducted at a single facility. Although operating at anticipated levels, the Nixon Facility is still in a recommissioning phase and may require unscheduled downtime for unanticipated reasons, including maintenance and repairs, voluntary regulatory compliance measures, or cessation or suspension by regulatory authorities. Occasionally, the Nixon Facility experiences a temporary shutdown due to power outages because of high winds and thunderstorms. In the case of such a shutdown, the refinery must initiate a standard start-up process, and such process can last several days although we are typically able to resume normal operations the next day. Any scheduled or unscheduled downtime may result in lost margin opportunity, increased maintenance expense and a build-up of refined petroleum products inventory, which could reduce our ability to meet our payment obligations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, the Nixon Facility operated for a total of 291 days, reflecting 75 days of refinery downtime. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Nixon Facility operated for a total of 341 days, reflecting 24 days of refinery downtime. The significant increase in refinery downtime between the periods was primarily the result of significant under-delivery of crude oil and condensate by GEL, which resulted in 59 of the 75 days of refinery downtime. (See \u201cPart I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d as well as \u201cPart II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note (20) Commitments and Contingencies - Legal Matters\u201d for disclosures related to the current contract-related dispute with GEL.)\nBLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY\nFORM 10-K\nWe may have capital needs for which our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity may not be adequate. Further, LEH may, but is not required to, fund our working capital requirements in the event our internally generated cash flows and other sources of liquidity are inadequate.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise secure sufficient liquidity to support our short-term and long-term capital requirements, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations or pursue our business strategies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity. We have relied on LEH to fund working capital requirements when cash reserves and revenue from operations, including sales of refined petroleum products and rental of petroleum storage tanks, were insufficient to fund our working capital requirements. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, accounts payable to LEH was $0.\nIn the event our working capital requirements are inadequate, or we are otherwise unable to secure sufficient liquidity to support our short term and/or long-term capital requirements, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations, comply with certain deadlines related to environmental regulations and standards, or pursue our business strategies, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or liquidity. Our short-term working capital needs are primarily related to acquisition of crude oil and condensate to operate the Nixon Facility, repayment of debt obligations, and capital expenditures for maintenance, upgrades, and refurbishment of equipment at the Nixon Facility. Our long-term working capital needs are primarily related to repayment of long-term debt obligations. Our liquidity will affect our ability to satisfy all these needs.\nWe are party to a variety of contracts and agreements with Genesis and GEL, and, if we are unable to successfully maintain this relationship, our operations, liquidity and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe are party to a variety of contracts and agreements with Genesis and GEL for the purchase of crude oil and condensate, transportation of crude oil and condensate, inventory risk management, and other services. Certain of these agreements with Genesis and GEL automatically renew for successive one-year terms until August 2019 unless Genesis and/or GEL provide us with notice of nonrenewal at least 180 days prior to expiration of any renewal term.\nWe are currently involved in a contract-related dispute with GEL. The adverse change in our relationship with Genesis and GEL has had a material adverse effect on our operations, liquidity, and financial condition. In addition, the contract-related dispute has affected our ability to obtain financings, prevented us from taking advantage of business opportunities, disrupted normal business operations, and diverted management\u2019s focus away from operations. We expect these effects to continue until the dispute is resolved. We are unable to predict the outcome of the current proceedings with GEL or their ultimate impact, if any, on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, an unfavorable resolution of the dispute could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and financial condition and results of operations. (See \u201cPart I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d as well as \u201cPart II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note (20) Commitments and Contingencies - Genesis Agreements\u201d and \u201cLegal Matters\u201d for disclosures related to a Joint Marketing Agreement (the \u201cJoint Marketing Agreement\u201d) with GEL, Crude Supply Agreement, and the current contract-related dispute with GEL.)\nAn unfavorable outcome of the contract-related dispute with GEL could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are a party to a contract-related dispute with GEL. Litigation and contract-related disputes through arbitration can be expensive, lengthy, disruptive to normal business operations, and divert management\u2019s focus away from operations. We expect these effects to continue until the dispute is resolved. Moreover, the outcomes of complex legal proceedings or contract-related disputes can be difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of a legal proceeding or contract-related dispute could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and reputation. However, an unfavorable resolution of the dispute could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and financial condition and results of operations.\nWe record provisions for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is likely and the loss can reasonably be estimated. Due to the inherent uncertain nature of litigation, the ultimate outcome or actual cost of settlement may materially differ from estimates. We are unable to predict the outcome of the current proceedings with GEL or their ultimate impact, if any, on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Accordingly, we have not recorded an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2016.\nBLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY\nFORM 10-K\nOur business may suffer if any of the executive officers or other key personnel discontinues employment with us. Furthermore, a shortage of skilled labor or disruptions in our labor force may make it difficult for us to maintain productivity.\nOur future success depends on the services of the executive officers and other key personnel and on our continuing ability to recruit, train and retain highly qualified personnel in all areas of our operations. Furthermore, our operations require skilled and experienced personnel with proficiency in multiple tasks. Competition for skilled personnel with industry-specific experience is intense, and the loss of these executives or personnel could harm our business. If any of these executives or other key personnel resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nLoss of market share by a key customer or consolidation among our customer base that could harm our operating results.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we had 4 customers that accounted for approximately 67% of our refined petroleum product sales. At December 31, 2016 these 4 customers represented approximately $1.6 million in accounts receivable. For the year ended December 31, 2016, LEH, a related party, was 1 of our 4 significant customers. LEH accounted for approximately 27% of our refined petroleum product sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. LEH, which resells jet fuel to a government agency, represented approximately $1.6 million in accounts receivable at December 31, 2016. LEH was not a significant customer during 2015. (See \u201cPart II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note (8) Related Party Transactions\u201d for additional disclosures with respect to related parties.)\nOur customers have a variety of suppliers to choose from and therefore can make substantial demands on us, including demands on product pricing and on contractual terms, which often results in the allocation of risk to us as the supplier. Our ability to maintain strong relationships with our principal customers is essential to our future performance. Our operating results could be harmed if a key customer is lost, reduces their order quantity, requires us to reduce our prices, is acquired by a competitor, or suffers financial hardship.\nAdditionally, our profitability could be adversely affected if there is consolidation among our customer base and our customers command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale. We could decide not to sell our refined petroleum products to a certain customer if, because of increased leverage, the customer pressures us to reduce our pricing such that our gross profits are diminished, which could result in a decrease in our revenue. Consolidation may also lead to reduced demand for our products, replacement of our products by the combined entity with those of our competitors, and cancellations of orders, each of which could harm our operating results.\nThe sale of refined petroleum products to the wholesale market is our primary business, and if we fail to maintain and grow the market share of our refined petroleum products, our operating results could suffer.\nOur success in the wholesale market depends in large part on our ability to maintain and grow our image and reputation as a reliable operator and to expand into and gain market acceptance of our refined petroleum products. Adverse perceptions of product quality, whether justified, or allegations of product quality issues, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish our reputation and cause our wholesale customers to choose refined petroleum products offered by our competitors.\nWe are dependent on third-parties for the transportation of crude oil and condensate into and refined petroleum products out of our Nixon Facility, and if these third-parties become unavailable to us, our ability to process crude oil and condensate and sell refined petroleum products to wholesale markets could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on trucks for the receipt of crude oil and condensate into and the sale of refined petroleum products out of our Nixon Facility. Since we do not own or operate any of these trucks, their continuing operation is not within our control. If any of the third-party trucking companies that we use, or the trucking industry in general, become unavailable to transport crude oil, condensate, and/or our refined petroleum products because of acts of God, accidents, government regulation, terrorism or other events, our revenue and net income would be materially and adversely affected.\nBLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY\nFORM 10-K\nOur suppliers source a substantial amount, if not all, of our crude oil and condensate from the Eagle Ford Shale and may experience interruptions of supply from that region.\nOur suppliers source a substantial amount, if not all, of our crude oil and condensate from the Eagle Ford Shale. Consequently, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of supply from that region caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production, unavailability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, plant closures for scheduled maintenance or interruption of transportation of oil or natural gas produced from the wells in that area.\nOur refining operations and customers are primarily located within the Eagle Ford Shale and changes in the supply/demand balance in this region could result in lower refining margins.\nOur primary operating asset, the Nixon Facility, is in the Eagle Ford Shale and we market our refined petroleum products in a single, relatively limited geographic area. Therefore, we are more susceptible to regional economic conditions than our more geographically diversified competitors. Should the supply/demand balance shift in our region due to changes in the local economy, an increase in refining capacity or other reasons, resulting in supply in the PADD 3 (Gulf Coast) region to exceed demand, we would have to deliver refined petroleum products to customers outside of our current operating region and thus incur considerably higher transportation costs, resulting in lower refining margins.\nHedging of our refined petroleum products and crude oil and condensate may limit our gains and expose us to other risks.\nWe are exposed to commodity price risk related to our crude oil and condensate and refined petroleum product inventories. Crack spreads are a significant driver of our operating margins. Our feedstock acquisition costs and refined petroleum products sales prices depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include domestic and foreign market conditions, political affairs, and economic developments; import supply levels and export opportunities; existing domestic inventory levels; operating and production levels of competing refineries; expansion and/or upgrades of competitors\u2019 facilities; governmental regulations; weather conditions; availability of and access to transportation infrastructure; availability of competing fuels; and seasonal fluctuations. Under our inventory risk management policy, we may use derivative instruments as certain of our refined petroleum product inventories exceed certain thresholds to reduce our commodity price risk. If our inventory risk management system fails and/or is implemented poorly or not at all, we could experience a negative effect on our operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nRegulation of greenhouse gas emissions could increase our operational costs and reduce demand for our products.\nContinued political focus on climate change, human activities contributing to the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and potential mitigation through regulation could have a material impact on our operations and financial results. International agreements and federal, state and local regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions are currently in various stages of discussion and implementation. These and other greenhouse gas emissions-related laws, policies, and regulations may result in substantial capital, compliance, operating, and maintenance costs. The level of expenditure required to comply with these laws and regulations is uncertain and is expected to vary depending on the laws enacted in each jurisdiction, our activities in the particular jurisdiction, and market conditions. The effect of regulation on our financial performance will depend on many factors including, among others, the sectors covered, the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required by law, the extent to which we would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations, our ability to acquire compliance related equipment, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits, and our ability to recover incurred regulatory compliance costs through the pricing of our products. Material price increases or incentives to conserve or use alternative energy sources could also reduce demand for products we currently sell and adversely affect our sales volumes, revenues and margins.\nBLUE DOLPHIN ENERGY COMPANY\nFORM 10-K\nRisks Related to Our Pipelines and Oil and Gas Properties\nRequests by the BOEM to increase bonds or other sureties to maintain compliance with the BOEM\u2019s regulations could significantly impact our liquidity and financial condition.\nTo cover the various obligations of lessees on the Outer Continental Shelf, such as the cost to plug and abandon wells and decommission and remove platforms and pipelines at the end of production, the BOEM generally requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability per regulations or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be satisfied, unless the BOEM exempts the lessee from such financial assurance requirements. In 2014, the BOEM issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in which the agency indicated that it was considering changing the financial assurance requirements, and it currently plans to publish a revised notice to lessees in 2016. Part of the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking includes the BOEM revising its supplemental bonding procedures by shifting from the current \u201cwaiver\u201d model for self-insurance to a credit based model. The cost of these bonds or assurances can be substantial, and there is no assurance that they can be obtained in all cases.\nIn 2015, we received notice from the BOEM requesting additional supplemental bonds or acceptable financial assurance of approximately $4.2 million for existing pipeline rights-of-way. We are currently working with the BOEM to develop a tailored plan to address the financial assurance requirements. There can be no assurance that the BOEM will accept a reduced amount of supplemental financial assurance or not require additional supplemental pipeline bonds related to our existing pipeline rights-of-way. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we maintained approximately $0.9 million in credit and cash-backed rights-of-way bonds issued to the BOEM.\nMore stringent requirements imposed by the BOEM and the BSEE related to the decommissioning, plugging, and abandonment of wells, platforms, and pipelines could materially increase our estimate of future AROs.\nIn 2010, the BOEM issued a notice to lessees that establishes a more stringent regimen for the timely decommissioning of what is known as \u201cidle iron\u201d - wells, platforms, and pipelines that are no longer producing or serving exploration or support functions related to an operator\u2019s lease. The notice to lessees sets forth more stringent standards for decommissioning timing by requiring that any well that has not been used during the past five years for exploration or production on active leases and is no longer capable of producing in paying quantities must be permanently plugged or temporarily abandoned within three years. Plugging or abandonment of wells may be delayed by two years if all the well\u2019s hydrocarbon and sulfur zones are appropriately isolated. Similarly, platforms or other facilities which are no longer useful for operations must be removed within five years of the cessation of operations. The triggering of these plugging, abandonment, and removal activities under what may be viewed as an accelerated schedule in comparison to historical decommissioning efforts could cause an increase, perhaps materially, in our future plugging, abandonment, and removal costs, which may translate into a need to increase our estimate of future AROs.\nAlthough management has used its best efforts to determine future AROs, assumptions and estimates can be influenced by many factors beyond management\u2019s control. Such factors include, but are not limited to, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in costs for abandonment related services and technologies, which could increase or decrease based on supply and demand, and/or extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, which may cause structural or other damage to pipeline and related assets and oil and gas properties. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our estimated future asset retirement obligations were approximately $2.0 million. See \u201cPart II, Item 8.
