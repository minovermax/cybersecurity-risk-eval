Because of these factors, past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future results. Set forth below and elsewhere in this document are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this document. The most significant factors affecting our business and operations include the following:\nOur exposure to pending and future asbestos claims and related liabilities, assets, and cash flows is subject to significant uncertainties.\nSubsidiaries of ITT, ITT LLC (f/k/a ITT Corporation) and Goulds Pumps LLC (f/k/a Goulds Pumps, Inc.), have been sued, along with many other companies, in numerous lawsuits in which the plaintiffs claim damages for personal injury arising from exposure to asbestos from component parts of certain products sold or distributed by various defendants, including certain ITT subsidiaries. We expect they will be sued in similar actions in the future. As such, we record an estimated liability related to pending claims and similar claims that we estimate will be filed over the next 10 years based on a number of key assumptions, including the likelihood of suits being filed, claim acceptance rates, disease type, settlement values and defense costs. These assumptions are derived from ITT\u2019s recent experience and reflect our expectations about future claim activities. Although it is probable that the Company will incur additional costs for asbestos claims filed beyond the next 10 years, we do not believe that there is a reasonable basis for estimating those costs at this time.\nIn addition, we record an asset that represents our best estimate of probable recoveries from our insurers for the estimated asbestos liabilities. There are significant assumptions made in developing estimates of asbestos-related recoveries, such as policy triggers, policy or contract interpretation, the methodology for allocating claims to policies, and the continued solvency of the Company\u2019s insurers. All of our primary insurance policies are exhausted, which may result in higher net cash outflows until excess carriers begin accepting claims for reimbursement. Performance by our insurers could differ from the assumptions underlying the recognized asset and could result in lower collections of receivables than are currently expected to reduce the Company\u2019s asbestos costs. In addition, insurance recoveries may vary significantly from period to period, and the recovery rate is expected to decline over time due to gaps in our insurance coverage, reflecting uninsured periods, the insolvency of certain insurers, prior settlements with our insurers and our expectation that certain insurance policies will exhaust within the next 10 years.\nDue to these uncertainties, as well as our inability to reasonably estimate any additional asbestos liability for claims that may be filed beyond the next 10 years, it is difficult to predict the ultimate cost, including potential recoveries, of resolving pending and unasserted asbestos claims. Changes in estimates related to these uncertainties may result in increases or decreases to the net asbestos liability, particularly if the quality, number of claims, or settlement or defense costs change significantly, if there are significant developments in the trend of case law or court procedures, or if\nlegislation or another alternative solution is implemented. The resolution of asbestos claims may take many years. We believe it is possible that the future events affecting the key factors and other variables within the next 10 years, as well as the cost of asbestos claims filed beyond the next 10 years, net of expected recoveries, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in any given period.\nOur operating results and our ability to maintain liquidity or procure capital may be adversely affected by unfavorable or uncertain global economic and capital market conditions.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience volatility in revenues, operating results and profitability due to uncertain global economic and capital market conditions. We have undertaken measures to reduce the impact of this volatility through diversification of markets and expansion of the geographic regions in which we operate. The end markets we serve include automotive, aerospace, oil and gas, industrial, mining, chemical, and defense, each of which is impacted by specific industry and general economic cycles. Important factors impacting our businesses include, but are not limited to, the overall strength of the global economy and our customers\u2019 confidence in local and global macroeconomic conditions, industrial spending, tax rates, interest rates, the availability of commercial financing, and regulations and tariffs in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Instability in the global credit markets and geopolitical environment in many parts of the world may put pressure on global economic conditions. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in key markets or regions deteriorate, we may experience material impacts on our financial statements.\nWe closely monitor the credit-worthiness of our insurers and customers and evaluate their ability to meet their obligations. However, adverse changes to financial conditions could jeopardize these counterparty obligations. A tightening of credit markets may reduce funds available to our customers to pay for our products and services for a prolonged and perhaps unknown period of time. Restrictive credit markets may also result in customers extending terms for payment and may result in our having higher customer receivables with increased risk of default.\nShould market conditions deteriorate, this may also adversely affect our ability to manage inventory levels and maintain current levels of profitability. If, for any reason, we lose access to commercial paper markets or our currently available lines of credit, or if we are required to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or we may be able to do so only on unfavorable terms. Deteriorating market conditions could also indicate an impairment in the value of our goodwill and intangible assets in one or more of our reporting units which would require us to recognize a non-cash charge to our Statement of Operations. We test both goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.\nWe are subject to inherent business risks due to our operations and sales outside the U.S. and in emerging markets.\nOur international operations, including U.S. exports, comprise a growing portion of our operations and are a strategic focus for continued future growth. Our strategy calls for increasing sales in overseas markets, including emerging markets such as Mexico, South America, China, Russia, and the Middle East. In 2019, 68% of our total sales were to customers operating outside of the United States. Our sales from international operations and export sales are subject to varying degrees of risks inherent in doing business outside of the United States. These risks include the following, some of which could be impacted by changes in international trade agreements or the imposition or increase of tariffs or trade sanctions between the United States and other countries:\n\u2022\npossibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nrestrictions, regulations, or tax liabilities on currency repatriation;\n\u2022\npotential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies;\n\u2022\nthe disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire and maintain qualified staff in these regions; and\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs and trade barriers, sanctioned countries and individuals, and import and export licensing requirements.\nOur operations in emerging markets could involve additional uncertainties, including risks that governments may impose limitations on our ability to repatriate funds, impose or increase withholding or other taxes on remittances and other payments to us, seek to nationalize our assets, or impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business. In addition, emerging markets pose other uncertainties, including challenges to our ability to protect our intellectual property, pressure on the pricing of our products, and risks of political instability.\nThe cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing, or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable profit margins.\nSignificant movements in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements.\nA significant portion of our sales are to customers operating outside the U.S.; therefore, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our results of operations. The primary currencies to which we have exposure are the Euro, Mexican peso, Polish zloty, South Korean won, Chinese renminbi, and the Czech koruna. From time to time, we may enter into derivative contracts to hedge some of these foreign currency exposures. However, our hedging strategy may fail to reduce our exposure or could result in unfavorable impact to our operating results.\nAs we continue to grow our business internationally, our operating results could be affected by the relative strength or weakness of global economies and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Any significant change in the value of currencies of the countries in which we do business relative to the value of the U.S. dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may also impact our results when the currency of a transaction differs from the functional currency of our operating unit, or when financial statements in the functional currency of non-U.S. operating units are translated into U.S. dollars.\nRecently announced tariffs remain uncertain and may continue to have a negative impact to our business.\nBeginning in 2018, the U.S. government undertook a series of actions to increase tariffs on certain goods imported into the U.S., including steel and aluminum, and in response governments in Europe and China have imposed retaliatory tariffs on various goods, including on certain goods we sell into those countries. These tariffs have negatively impacted the price of certain parts and materials we purchase to be included in the finished products we sell in the U.S., as well as the cost of the final product when re-exported. Since announced, we have been managing these impacts and will continue attempting to mitigate the impact of these tariffs by lowering input costs through pricing and supply chain actions, efficient utilization of our global manufacturing footprint, and supplier and customer negotiations and diversification strategies. However, we expect that continued trade disputes between the U.S. and Europe, China, and other countries, and other governmental actions related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies may continue to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers and suppliers.\nOur business is impacted by our customers' levels of capital investment and maintenance expenditures, particularly in the oil and gas, chemical, and mining markets.\nDemand for certain industrial products and services depends on the level of capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures of our customers. Our customers' levels of capital expenditures depend, in turn, on general economic conditions, availability of credit, economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior. Additionally, volatility in commodity prices can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders. The ability of our customers to finance capital investment and maintenance may also be affected by factors independent of the conditions in their industries, such as the condition of global credit and capital markets.\nThe businesses of many of our customers, particularly those in the oil and gas, chemical, and mining industries, which represent approximately 10%, 9%, and 3%, respectively, of our 2019 revenue, are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced, and may in the future experience, periodic downturns of varying severity. Our customers in these industries, particularly those whose demand for our products and services is primarily profit-driven, historically have tended to delay large capital projects, including expensive maintenance and upgrades, during economic downturns. Additionally, fluctuating energy demand forecasts and commodity pricing and other macroeconomic factors may cause our customers to be more conservative in their capital planning, which could reduce demand for our products and services. Reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. This reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in our industry. Any of these results could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nAdditionally, some of our industrial products customers may choose to postpone capital investment and maintenance, even during favorable conditions in their industries or markets, which could lead to the delay or cancellation of orders. Despite these favorable conditions, the general health of global credit and capital markets and our customers' ability to access such markets may significantly impact investments in large capital projects, as well as necessary maintenance and upgrades. In addition, the liquidity and financial position of our customers, which are\ntypically directly linked to the economies in which they operate, could impact capital investment decisions and their ability to pay in full and/or on a timely basis. Any of these factors, whether individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, in turn, our business and financial results.\nFailure to compete successfully in our markets could adversely affect our business.\nWe provide products and services to competitive markets. We believe the principal points of competition in our markets are product performance, reliability and innovation, application expertise, brand reputation, energy efficiency, product life cycle cost, timeliness of delivery, proximity of service centers, effectiveness of distribution channels and price.\nMaintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment by us in manufacturing, research and development, engineering, marketing, customer service and support, and our distribution networks. We may not be successful in maintaining our competitive position. Our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products, or may develop more efficient or effective methods of providing products and services or may adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures also could cause us to adjust the prices of certain products to stay competitive. We may not be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors.\nOur operating costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, raw materials, energy and related utilities, freight, tariffs, and cost of labor. In order to remain competitive, we may not be able to recoup all or a portion of these higher costs from our customers through product price increases. Further, our ability to realize financial benefits from efficiency initiatives may not be able to mitigate these manufacturing and operating cost increases and, as a result, could negatively impact our profitability.\nQuality problems with our manufacturing processes or finished goods could harm our reputation for producing high-quality products and erode our competitive advantage, sales, and market share.\nWe manufacture key components that are integral to the operation of systems and manufacturing processes in the automotive, aerospace, rail, oil and gas, industrial, mining, chemical, and defense markets. The reliability and performance of our products are critically important to our customers and the users of their products. Accordingly, quality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the potentially costly consequences of product failure. Our quality certifications, including products manufactured to military specifications, are critical to the marketing success of our goods and services. If we fail to meet these standards, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose customers or the ability to sell certain products, and our revenue and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Our success in part depends on our ability to manufacture to exact tolerances precision-engineered components, subassemblies, and finished devices from multiple materials. If our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards, our reputation as a manufacturer of high-quality components will be harmed, our competitive advantage could be damaged, and we could lose customers, market share or our ability to sell certain products.\nWe are subject to risks related to government contracting, including changes in levels of government spending and regulatory and contractual requirements applicable to sales to the U.S. government.\nOur Connect & Control Technologies and Motion Technologies segments derive a portion of their revenue from sales to U.S. government customers and higher tier contractors who sell to the U.S. government. The government's expenditures are subject to political and budgetary fluctuations and constraints, which may result in significant unexpected changes in levels of demand for our products. In addition, the award, administration and performance of government contracts is subject to regulatory and contractual requirements that differ significantly from the terms and conditions that apply to contracts with our non-governmental customers. We have in the past and may in the future be subject to audits and investigations to evaluate our compliance with these requirements. If we are found to have failed to comply with requirements applicable to government contractors, we may be subject to various actions, including but not limited to fines or penalties, reductions in the value of our government contracts, restrictions on the sale of certain products to the government, or suspension or debarment from government contracting. Failure to comply with applicable requirements also could harm our reputation and our ability to compete for future government contracts or sell equivalent commercial products. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected by raw material price volatility and the inability of suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements.\nOur business relies on third-party suppliers for raw materials, components and contract manufacturing services to produce our products. The supply of raw materials to the Company and to its component parts suppliers could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. Commodity prices and the prices for other raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past, impacting our operating results and significant future increases in commodity prices could adversely affect our results of operations and profit margins. Due to pricing pressure or other factors, we may not be able to pass along increased raw material and component prices to our customers in the form of price increases or our ability to do so could be delayed. Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nFor most of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply, or the required materials are readily available. In limited instances we depend on a single source of supply, manufacturing or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to a limited number of suppliers. While we believe we could obtain and qualify alternative sources for most sole and limited source supplier materials, if necessary, the transition to an alternative source could be complex, costly, and protracted, especially if the change requires us to redesign our systems. Delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers, including production interruptions at suppliers, capacity constraints, labor disputes, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, the ability of suppliers to meet regulatory requirements and suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers. Any delay in our suppliers\u2019 abilities to provide us with sufficient quality or flow of materials or any supplier price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and, accordingly, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nIf we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services effectively, our revenue, gross margin and profitability could suffer. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from a single customer.\nWe use a variety of sales channels to sell our products and services. Successfully managing these sales channels is a complex process as we sell a broad mix of products through a network of approximately 700 distributors, agents, and value-added resellers. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and profit margins, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and profit margins. In addition, changes to the sales channels could introduce additional complexity to our sales and inventory management processes and could cause disruptions to customer service or create channel conflicts.\nFurther, we must manage inventory effectively, particularly with respect to sales to distributors, which involves forecasting demand and potential pricing issues. Distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products. Our reliance on indirect distribution methods may reduce visibility to end-customer demand, generating a time lag to the market trend with potential negative impacts on inventory levels and strategic decisions, including pricing, capital deployment, and operational decisions.\nOur financial results could be adversely affected by the loss of or delays caused by a distributor, the loss or deterioration of some distribution or reseller arrangements, channel conflicts, including the consolidation of third-party distributors, or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken. Some of our distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions, including economic weakness, leading to a slowness or difficulty in the cash collection process.\nSales to Continental, ITT's largest customer, were approximately 10% of our total revenue in 2019. A significant portion of the OEM revenue, typically about half, is derived at the automakers' direction to use an ITT brake pad in Continental's braking systems (calipers), generally through supply agreements signed directly with automakers. The remaining Continental revenue is generated from a long term aftermarket agreement. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nChanges in our effective tax rates as a result of changes in the realizability of our deferred tax assets, the geographic mix of earnings, tax examinations or disputes, tax authority rulings, or changes in the tax laws, may adversely affect our financial results.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. We exercise significant judgment in calculating our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Furthermore, changes in domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain income or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our tax expense and profitability.\nAny significant increase in our future effective tax rates could reduce net income in future periods. Given the global nature of our business, a number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the geographic mix of our profits among jurisdictions with differing statutory income tax rates;\n\u2022\nsustainability of historical income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws applicable to us;\n\u2022\nexpiration, renewal, or application of tax holidays;\n\u2022\nthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; or\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities, and deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\nThe amount of income taxes and other taxes we have paid are subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts paid or reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments. We are currently under routine examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and we may be subject to additional examinations in the future. The tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material items and thereby increase our tax liability. Failure to sustain our position in these matters could result in a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\nFailure to retain our existing senior management, engineering and other key personnel or the inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could negatively impact our ability to operate or grow our business.\nOur success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our ability to retain or attract a significant number of employees in senior management and engineering and other key personnel. The ability to attract or retain employees will depend on our ability to offer competitive compensation, training and cultural benefits. We will need to continue to develop a roster of qualified talent to support business growth and replace departing employees. A failure to retain or attract highly skilled personnel could adversely affect our operating results or our ability to operate or grow our business.\nOur inability to protect our own intellectual property rights, or unintentionally violating the intellectual property rights of others could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nObtaining, maintaining and enforcing our proprietary rights is critical to the success of our business. For certain products and manufacturing processes, we rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, non-disclosure agreements and other contracts to protect these rights. These contracts may be breached, or may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling similar products, and therefore could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, during the normal course of business, we could unintentionally infringe or violate the proprietary rights of others. Intellectual property litigation could be time consuming for management, and could result in significant legal expense to either pursue claims against others, or to defend ourselves. If we are unable to protect our patents, trademarks, or other proprietary rights, or if we infringe or violate the rights of others, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nA material business interruption, particularly at one of our manufacturing facilities, could negatively impact our ability to generate sales and meet customer demand.\nIf operations at one of our manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted as a result of an equipment failure, natural disaster, power outage, fire, explosion, act of terrorism, war, IT system failure, cyber-attack, adverse weather conditions, labor disputes, epidemic illness (including without limitation, 2019 novel coronavirus), relocation of production location, or any other reason, our financial performance could be adversely affected as a result of our inability to meet customer demand for our products. We have business continuity plans in place to mitigate the effects of such interruptions, but these plans may not be sufficient to resolve the issues in a timely manner. A significant interruption in production capability could also require us to make substantial payments due to non-performance, which could negatively affect\nour results of operations. We also have insurance for certain covered losses which we believe to be adequate to offset a significant portion of the costs for reconstruction of facilities and equipment, as well as certain financial losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown. However, any recovery under our insurance policies would be subject to deductibles and, depending on the coverage, may not offset the lost revenues or increased expenses that may be experienced during the disruption of operations.\nRecently, the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus in China has caused temporary restrictions on travel and closures of plants and offices owned by ITT, our suppliers and customers, and other businesses in China while the country attempts to control the virus. At this time, it is unknown when the virus will be fully contained and therefore we may be negatively impacted by future closures, whether mandated by the government or at the discretion of senior management, or the virus may spread to our workforce causing a material business interruption.\nCyber security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties. In the ordinary course of business, we collect and store confidential information, including proprietary business information belonging to us, our customers, suppliers, business partners and other third parties and personally identifiable information of our employees. We have taken many steps to protect our information systems, including the installation of protective systems that monitor, test, and backup our systems, as well as annual employee training. For third parties that manage our confidential data on cloud-based servers, we have a robust process to ensure the third party has appropriate systems and controls in place to manage potential cyber threats.\nOur information technology systems and those of third party service providers may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, cyber-attacks, and user errors. If we experience a disruption in our information technology systems, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could materially adversely affect our business. Moreover, even the most well-protected information systems are vulnerable to internal and external security breaches including, but not limited to, those by computer hackers and cyber terrorists utilizing techniques such as phishing, ransomware or denial of service attacks. In addition, as a provider of products and services to government and commercial customers, and particularly as a government contractor, we are subject to a heightened risk of security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism, including by foreign governments and cyber terrorists. Furthermore, information technology security threats are increasing in sophistication, intensity, and frequency. While we actively manage the risks to our information systems that are within our control, we can provide no assurance that our actions or those of our third party service providers will be successful in eliminating or mitigating risks to our systems, networks or data. Accordingly, a security breach may occur, including breaches that we may be unable to detect. The unavailability of our information systems, the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of security could cause significant disruption to our business or could result in decreased performance and increased costs, causing an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our security processes and procedures and our compliance with evolving government cyber security requirements for government contractors, potentially causing us to lose business. A breach could also result in the loss of our intellectual property, potentially impacting our long-term capability to compete for sales of affected products. In addition, a breach of security of our information systems could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability, as well as increased costs to implement further information security measures. If we are unable to prevent, detect or adequately respond to cyber security breaches, our operations could be disrupted and our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in laws relating to the use and transfer of personal and other information could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe processing and storage of certain information is increasingly subject to privacy and data security regulations, and many such regulations are country-specific. The interpretation and application of data protection laws in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere are uncertain, evolving and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. Compliance with these (including California's Consumer Privacy Act, which became effective on January 1, 2020) various laws may be onerous and require us to incur substantial costs or to change our business practices in a manner that adversely affects our business, while failure to comply with such laws may subject us to substantial penalties. For example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in May 2018, imposed significant new requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant fines for non-compliance. The costs of compliance with the GDPR and the potential for fines and other related costs in the event of a breach of the GDPR or other information security or privacy requirements may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nPortfolio management strategies for growth, including cost-saving initiatives, may not meet expectations.\nWe regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through the acquisition of other companies, assets and product lines that either complement or expand our existing businesses. Although we conduct what we believe to be a prudent level of investigation regarding the operating and financial condition of the businesses we purchase, a level of risk remains regarding the actual operating condition of these businesses. Until we actually assume operating control of these businesses and their operations, we may not be able to ascertain the actual value or understand the potential liabilities of, or challenges facing, the acquired businesses and their operations. Acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial results, and business, including that an acquired business could under-perform relative to our expectations, the failure to realize expected synergies, difficulty in the integration of technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems, the possibility that we have acquired substantial undisclosed liabilities, potentially insufficient internal controls over financial activities or financial reporting at an acquired company that could impact us on a consolidated basis, diversion of management attention from other businesses, loss of key employees of the acquired businesses, increased capital requirements and customer dissatisfaction.\nOur portfolio reviews also include the potential for cost-saving initiatives through restructuring and other initiatives. We strive for and expect to achieve cost savings in connection with certain initiatives, including: (i) manufacturing process and supply chain rationalization; (ii) streamlining redundant administrative overhead and support activities; and (iii) restructuring and realignment actions. Cost savings expectations are inherently uncertain and, therefore, we cannot provide assurance that we will achieve any expected, or any actual cost savings. Our restructuring activities may place substantial demands on our management, which could lead to the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business priorities and result in a reduced customer focus. In addition, restructuring activities may result in a loss of knowledge or expertise or could negatively impact employee performance and retention. If any of these outcomes occur, it could have a material adverse impact on our business or financial results.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the inability of suppliers to provide us with certifications relating to conflict minerals.\nSince our supply chain is complex, ultimately we may not be able to sufficiently discover the origin of the conflict minerals (generally defined as the minerals tin, tantalum, titanium and gold which have been extracted from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries) used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may adversely affect our reputation with our customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of our products are certified as conflict mineral free. If we are not able to meet such requirements, customers may choose not to purchase our products, which could adversely affect our sales and the value of portions of our inventory. Further, there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free minerals and, as a result, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain metals, if necessary, from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Any one or a combination of these various factors could harm our business, reduce market demand for our products, and adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in environmental laws or regulations, the discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, or the failure of a potentially responsible party to perform may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, discharge or disposal of certain toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals, gases and other substances used in manufacturing our products. Some of these laws in the United States include the Federal Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, and similar state and foreign statutes and regulations. In the European Union (EU), we are subject to the EU regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals. Compliance with these laws and regulations could require us to incur substantial expenses. Environmental laws and regulations allow for the assessment of substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations, and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges. In addition, the discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination at a site which the Company previously operated or currently operates could suddenly subject the Company to costly remediation efforts. We also could be affected by changes in environmental laws or regulations, including, for example, those imposed in response to vapor intrusion or climate change concerns.\nDevelopments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations, violations by us of such laws and regulations, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, litigation involving environmental impacts, the adequacy of insurance policies, our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments, or\nfinancial insolvency of other potentially responsible parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other applicable anti-corruption legislation, as well as export controls and trade sanctions, could result in fines or criminal penalties.\nWe operate in a number of countries throughout the world, including countries known to have a reputation for corruption. We are committed to doing business in accordance with applicable anti-corruption laws. However, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or applicable non-U.S. laws, including anti-bribery, competition, trade sanctions and regulation, and other laws including but not limited to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, as well as trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Commerce. Any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, suspension or debarment from government contracts, or curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and might adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or financial position. Furthermore, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management. Even the allegation or appearance of our employees, agents or business partners acting improperly or illegally could damage our reputation and result in significant expenditures in investigating and responding to such actions.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those related to product liability and other matters.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of products for the markets we serve. In addition, many of the devices we manufacture and sell are critical components designed to be used in harsh environments for long periods of time where the cost of failure is high. Component failures, manufacturing defects, design flaws, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, an end-user of our products. The occurrence of such a problem could result in product liability claims or a recall of, or safety alert relating to, one or more of our products which could ultimately result, in certain cases, in the removal of such products from the marketplace and claims regarding costs associated therewith. Product liability claims or product recalls in the future, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers for our products.\nWe are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Any violations or failure to comply with securities laws, trade or tax rules or similar regulations could create a substantial liability for us, and also could cause harm to our reputation. Changes in laws, ordinances, regulations or other government policies, the nature, timing, and effect of which are uncertain, may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.\nFrom time to time we are involved in legal proceedings that are incidental to the operation of our businesses. Some of these proceedings allege damages relating to personal injury claims, employment and employee benefit matters and commercial or contractual disputes, sometimes related to acquisitions or divestitures. Additionally, we may become subject to significant claims of which we are currently unaware or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate or can estimate.\nPast divestitures and spin-offs may expose us to potential liabilities.\nWe have divested a number of businesses, including as part of spin-offs in 1995 and 2011. With respect to some of these former businesses, we have contractually agreed to indemnify the counterparties against, or otherwise retain, certain liabilities, including, for example certain lawsuits, tax liabilities, product liability claims, asbestos claims, or environmental matters. Even without ongoing contractual indemnification obligations, we could be exposed to liabilities arising out of such divestitures. In addition, the counterparties to those divestitures may have agreed to indemnify us or assume certain liabilities relating to those divestitures. Similarly, there can be no assurance that the indemnity or assumption of liability by the counterparties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these liabilities, or that a counterparty will be able to fully satisfy its obligations. Third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that a counterparty agreed to assume. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering any amounts for which we were initially held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Indiana law could delay or prevent a change in control.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. For example, the articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock. In addition, the articles of incorporation and by-laws, among other things, do not permit action by written consent of the shareholders. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. Indiana law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 10% or more of our outstanding common stock and us as well as certain restrictions on the voting rights of \"control shares\" of an \"issuing public corporation.\"", "PERMNO": 12570, "SIC": 3561, "TIC": "ITT"}
