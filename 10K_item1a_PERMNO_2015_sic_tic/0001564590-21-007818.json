Risk Factors\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in this report as well as our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has and may continue to adversely impact our business, including the commercialization of our medicines, our supply chain, our clinical trials, our liquidity and access to capital markets and our business development activities.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization made the assessment that a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 disease, was a pandemic. The President of the United States declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency and many states and municipalities in the Unites States took aggressive actions to reduce the spread of the disease, including limiting non-essential gatherings of people, ceasing all non-essential travel, ordering certain businesses and government agencies to cease non-essential operations at physical locations and issuing \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders which direct individuals to shelter at their places of residence (subject to limited exceptions). Similarly, the Irish government has limited gatherings of people and encouraged employees to work from their homes, and may implement more aggressive policies in the future. In addition, in mid-March 2020 we implemented work-from-home policies for all employees and moved to a \u201cvirtual\u201d model with respect to our physician, patient and partner support activities. As certain U.S. states started to reduce restrictions, we saw physician offices beginning to reopen, which reopening has varied on a state-by-state basis. As a result, our sales representatives in some areas have transitioned to being back out in the field and are working on ways to re-engage patients and physicians in person. However, as COVID-19 cases have increased in certain areas, certain U.S. states have started to reimplement restrictions and we have seen some physician offices re-establish limits on in-person visits. Restrictions in response to COVID-19 may continue to fluctuate in U.S. states and other geographies and we cannot guarantee that additional U.S. states that have previously reduced restrictions will not reimplement them or that other states will reduce restrictions in the near-term. The effects of government actions and our policies and those of third parties to reduce the spread of COVID-19 may negatively impact productivity and our ability to market and sell our medicines, cause disruptions to our supply chain and ongoing and future clinical trials and impair our ability to execute our business development strategy. These and other disruptions in our operations and the global economy could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe commercialization of our medicines has been and will continue to be adversely impacted by COVID-19 and actions taken to slow its spread. For example, patients have postponed visits to healthcare provider facilities, certain healthcare providers have temporarily closed their offices or are restricting patient visits, healthcare provider employees may become generally unavailable and there could be disruptions in the operations of payers, distributors, logistics providers and other third parties that are necessary for our medicines to be prescribed, reimbursed and administered to patients. In March 2020, we transitioned our sales force to a virtual model such that they no longer had in-person interactions with healthcare professionals and while we have been working on ways to re-engage patients and physicians as certain U.S. states have started to reduce restrictions, the virtual model is still being used. While we have attempted to maintain the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts in the virtual model, it may not be as effective as in-person interactions in terms of conveying key information about our medicines or aiding physicians and their staff in prescribing and helping their patients obtain appropriate reimbursement for our medicines. Many physicians, in particular in primary care practices that prescribe our inflammation segment medicines, have reduced their operations in light of COVID-19, including delaying patient visits and writing new prescriptions, and this has negatively impacted sales in our inflammation segment. Similarly, many patients have deferred non-essential visits to healthcare providers, which has had a negative impact on prescriptions being written and filled. For example, due to reduced willingness of patients to visit physician offices and infusion centers, sales of KRYSTEXXA have been negatively impacted, and we expect this impact to continue in future quarters until healthcare activities and patient visits return to normal levels. In addition, while we experienced a much higher number of new patients in 2020 for TEPEZZA than our initial estimates, the impact from COVID-19 has slowed the generation of patient enrollment forms for TEPEZZA, which drive new patient starts. It is also possible that a prolonged period of \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders and social distancing behaviors and the associated reduction of physician office visits could force various healthcare practices to permanently close or to consolidate with larger practices or healthcare groups, which could cause us to lose previously-established physician relationships. We cannot predict how long the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact sales of our medicines and we expect that even after government-mandated restrictions are lifted, our sales force activities, healthcare provider operations and patients\u2019 willingness to visit healthcare facilities will continue to be limited. We also cannot predict how effective our virtual patient, physician and partner support initiatives will be with respect to marketing and supporting the administration and reimbursement of our medicines, or when we will be able to resume other in-person sales and marketing activities.\nQuarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders, or the perception that such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations could occur, related to COVID-19 or other infectious diseases could impact personnel at third-party manufacturing facilities upon which we rely, or the availability or cost of materials, which could disrupt the supply chain for our medicines. In particular, some of our suppliers of certain materials used in the production of our medicines are located in regions that have been subject to COVID-19-related actions and policies that limit the conduct of normal business operations. To the extent our suppliers and service providers are unable to comply with their obligations under our agreements with them or they are otherwise unable to deliver or are delayed in delivering goods and services to us due to COVID-19, our ability to continue meeting commercial demand for our medicines in the United States or advancing development of our medicine candidates may become impaired. For example, On December 17, 2020, we announced that we expected a short-term disruption in TEPEZZA supply as a result of recent U.S. government-mandated COVID-19 vaccine production pursuant to the Defense Production Act of 1950, or DPA, that have dramatically restricted capacity available for the production of TEPEZZA at our drug product contract manufacturer, Catalent. Refer to the Impact of COVID-19 section in Item 1 of Part I, Business, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. At this time, we consider our inventories on hand of all of our other medicines to be sufficient to meet our commercial requirements.\nOur clinical trials may be affected by COVID-19. As described in the Impact of COVID-19 section in Item 1 of Part I, Business, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, two of our clinical trials for TEPEZZA have been delayed due to the impact of the TEPEZZA supply disruption at Catalent. In addition, clinical site initiation and patient enrollment may be delayed due to prioritization of hospital and healthcare resources toward COVID-19. Current or potential patients in our ongoing or planned clinical trials may also choose to not enroll, not participate in follow-up clinical visits or drop out of the trial as a precaution against contracting COVID-19. Further, some patients may not be able or willing to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Some clinical sites in the United States have slowed or stopped further enrollment of new patients in clinical trials, denied access to site monitors or otherwise curtailed certain operations. Similarly, our ability to recruit and retain principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19, may be adversely impacted. These events could delay our clinical trials, increase the cost of completing our clinical trials and negatively impact the integrity, reliability or robustness of the data from our clinical trials.\nThe spread of COVID-19 and actions taken to reduce its spread may also materially affect us economically. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to slow its spread, the global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any additional debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly or more dilutive. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, there could be a significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity and financial position or our business development activities.\nCOVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact the commercialization of our medicines, our supply chain, our clinical trials, our access to capital and our business development activities, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the pandemic, the duration of the pandemic and the efforts by governments and business to contain it, business closures or business disruptions and the impact on the economy and capital markets.\nOur ability to generate revenues from our medicines is subject to attaining significant market acceptance among physicians, patients and healthcare payers.\nOur current medicines, and other medicines or medicine candidates that we may develop or acquire, may not attain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payers or the medical community. Some of our medicines, in particular TEPEZZA, have not been on the market for an extended period of time, which subjects us to numerous risks as we attempt to increase our market share. We believe that the degree of market acceptance and our ability to generate revenues from our medicines will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ntiming of market introduction of our medicines as well as competitive medicines;\n\u2022\nefficacy and safety of our medicines;\n\u2022\ncontinued projected growth of the markets in which our medicines compete;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which physicians diagnose and treat the conditions that our medicines are approved to treat;\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\nif and when we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for additional indications for our medicines;\n\u2022\nacceptance by patients, physicians and applicable specialists;\n\u2022\navailability of, and ability to maintain, coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing from government and other third-party payers;\n\u2022\npotential or perceived advantages or disadvantages of our medicines over alternative treatments, including cost of treatment and relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nstrength of sales, marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nthe price of our medicines, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nimpact of past and limitation of future medicine price increases;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain a continuous supply of our medicines for commercial sale;\n\u2022\nthe effect of current and future healthcare laws;\n\u2022\nthe extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the extent to which physicians and patients delay visits or writing or filling prescriptions for our medicines, the extent to which operations of healthcare facilities, including infusion centers, are reduced and the length of time and the extent to which our sales force must continue operating in a virtual model;\n\u2022\nthe performance of third-party distribution partners, over which we have limited control; and\n\u2022\nmedicine labeling or medicine insert requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or other regulatory authorities\nWith respect to TEPEZZA, sales will depend on market acceptance and adoption by physicians and healthcare payers, as well as the ability and willingness of physicians who do not have in-house infusion capability to refer patients to infusion sites of care. With respect to KRYSTEXXA, our ability to grow sales will be affected by the success of our sales, marketing and clinical strategies, which are intended to expand the patient population and usage of KRYSTEXXA. This includes our marketing efforts in nephrology and our studies designed to improve the response rate to KRYSTEXXA, to evaluate a shorter infusion time, and to evaluate the use of KRYSTEXXA in kidney transplant patients. With respect to RAVICTI, which is approved to treat a very limited patient population, our ability to grow sales will depend in large part on our ability to transition urea cycle disorder, or UCD, patients from BUPHENYL or generic equivalents, which are comparatively much less expensive, to RAVICTI and to educate patients and physicians on the benefits of continuing RAVICTI therapy once initiated. With respect to PROCYSBI, which is also approved to treat a very limited patient population, our ability to grow sales will depend in large part on our ability to transition patients from the first-generation immediate-release cysteamine therapy to PROCYSBI, to identify additional patients with nephropathic cystinosis and to educate patients and physicians on the benefits of continuing therapy once initiated. With respect to ACTIMMUNE, while it is the only FDA-approved treatment for chronic granulomatous disease, or CGD, and severe, malignant osteopetrosis, or SMO, they are very rare conditions and, as a result, our ability to grow ACTIMMUNE sales will depend on our ability to identify additional patients with such conditions and educate patients and physicians on the benefits of continuing treatment once initiated. With respect to each of PENNSAID 2% w/w, or PENNSAID 2%, RAYOS and DUEXIS, their higher cost compared to the generic or branded forms of their active ingredients alone may limit adoption by physicians, patients and healthcare payers. With respect to DUEXIS, if physicians remain unaware of, or do not otherwise believe in, the benefits of combining gastrointestinal protective agents with NSAIDs, our market opportunity will be limited. If our current medicines or any other medicine that we may seek approval for, or acquire, fail to attain market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenue to sustain profitability, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects (including, possibly, the value of our ordinary shares).\nOur future prospects are highly dependent on our ability to successfully develop and execute commercialization strategies for each of our medicines. Failure to do so would adversely impact our financial condition and prospects.\nA substantial majority of our resources are focused on the commercialization of our current medicines. Our ability to generate significant medicine revenues and to achieve commercial success in the near-term will initially depend almost entirely on our ability to successfully commercialize these medicines in the United States. With respect to our rare disease medicines, TEPEZZA, KRYSTEXXA, RAVICTI, PROCYSBI and ACTIMMUNE, our commercialization strategy includes efforts to increase awareness of the rare conditions that each medicine is designed to treat, enhancing efforts to identify target patients and in certain cases pursue opportunities for label expansion and more effective use through clinical trials. Our comprehensive post-launch commercial strategy for TEPEZZA aims to enable more thyroid eye disease, or TED, patients to benefit from TEPEZZA. We are doing this by: (i) facilitating continued TEPEZZA uptake in the treatment of acute and chronic TED through continued promotion of TEPEZZA to treating physicians; (ii) continuing to develop the TED market by increasing physician awareness of the disease severity, the urgency to diagnose and treat it, as well as the benefits of treatment with TEPEZZA; (iii) driving accelerated disease identification and time to treatment through our digital and broadcast marketing campaigns; (iv) enhancing the patient journey with our high-touch, patient-centric model as well as support for the patient and site-of-care referral processes; and (v) expanding more timely access to TEPEZZA for TED patients. Our strategy with respect to KRYSTEXXA includes existing rheumatology account growth, new rheumatology account growth and accelerating nephrology growth, as well as development efforts to enhance response rates through combination treatment with methotrexate and to shorten the infusion time. With respect to RAVICTI and PROCYSBI, our strategy includes accelerating the transition of patients from first-generation therapies, increasing the diagnosis of the associated rare conditions through patient and physician outreach; and increasing compliance rates. Our strategy with respect to ACTIMMUNE, includes increasing awareness and diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease and increasing compliance rates.\nWe are focusing a significant portion of our commercial activities and resources on TEPEZZA, and we believe our ability to grow our long-term revenues, and a significant portion of the value of our company, relates to our ability to successfully commercialize TEPEZZA in the United States. As a newly launched medicine for a disease that had no previously-approved treatments, successful commercialization of TEPEZZA is subject to many risks. There are numerous examples of unsuccessful product launches and failures to meet high expectations of market potential, including by pharmaceutical companies with more experience and resources than us. While we have established our commercial team and U.S. sales force, we will need to further train and develop the team in order to successfully commercialize TEPEZZA. There are many factors that could cause commercialization of TEPEZZA to be unsuccessful, including a number of factors that are outside our control. Because no medicine has previously been approved by the FDA for the treatment of TED, it is especially difficult to estimate TEPEZZA\u2019s market potential or the time it will take to increase patient and physician awareness of TED and change current treatment paradigms. For example, shortly after the launch of TEPEZZA, we transitioned our sales force to a virtual model in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which, combined with physicians generally reducing their own availability, has made it more challenging to execute on our strategy to educate physicians about TEPEZZA and the treatment of TED. In addition, some physicians that are potential prescribers of TEPEZZA do not have the necessary infusion capabilities to administer the medicine and may not otherwise be able or willing to refer their patients to third-party infusion centers, which may discourage them from treating their patients with TEPEZZA. The commercial success of TEPEZZA depends on the extent to which patients and physicians accept and adopt TEPEZZA as a treatment for TED. For example, if the patient population suffering from TED is smaller than we estimate, if it proves difficult to identify TED patients or educate physicians as to the availability and potential benefits of TEPEZZA, or if physicians are unwilling to prescribe or patients are unwilling to take TEPEZZA, the commercial potential of TEPEZZA will be limited. In addition, the current disruption in TEPEZZA supply has resulted in existing patients stopping therapy and an inability of new patients to initiate therapy. Once TEPEZZA supply normalizes, we cannot be certain how many prior TEPEZZA patients will re-initiate therapy or whether or when growth in TEPEZZA adoption will return to levels seen prior to the supply disruption. We also have limited information regarding how physicians, patients and payers will respond to the pricing of TEPEZZA. Physicians may not prescribe TEPEZZA and patients may be unwilling to use TEPEZZA if coverage is not provided or reimbursement is inadequate to cover a significant portion of the cost. Thus, significant uncertainty remains regarding the commercial potential of TEPEZZA. If the continued commercialization of TEPEZZA becomes unsuccessful or perceived as disappointing, the price of our ordinary shares could decline significantly and long-term success of the medicine and our company could be harmed.\nWith respect to our inflammation segment medicines, PENNSAID 2% and DUEXIS, our strategy has included entering into rebate agreements with pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, for certain of our inflammation segment medicines where we believe the rebates and costs justify expanded formulary access for patients and ensuring patient assistance to these drugs when prescribed through our HorizonCares program. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure additional rebate agreements on commercially reasonable terms, that expected volume growth will sufficiently offset the rebates and fees paid to PBMs or that our existing agreements with PBMs will have the intended impact on formulary access. In addition, as the terms of our existing agreements with PBMs expire, we may not be able to renew the agreements on commercially favorable terms, or at all. For each of our inflammation segment medicines, we expect that our commercial success will depend on our sales and marketing efforts in the United States, reimbursement decisions by commercial payers, the expense we incur through our patient assistance program for fully bought down contracts and the rebates we pay to PBMs, as well as the impact of numerous efforts at federal, state and local levels to further reduce reimbursement and net pricing of inflammation segment medicines.\nOur strategy for RAYOS in the United States is to focus on the rheumatology indications approved for RAYOS, including our collaboration with the Alliance for Lupus Research, to study the effect of RAYOS on the fatigue experienced by systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE, patients.\nIf any of our commercial strategies are unsuccessful or we fail to successfully modify our strategies over time due to changing market conditions, our ability to increase market share for our medicines, grow revenues and to sustain profitability will be harmed.\nWe are dependent on wholesale distributors for distribution of our products in the United States and, accordingly, our results of operations could be adversely affected if they encounter financial difficulties\nIn 2020, four wholesale distributors accounted for substantially all of our sales in the United States. If one of our significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties, such distributor may decrease the amount of business that it does with us, and we may be unable to collect all the amounts that the distributor owes on a timely basis or at all, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nIn order to increase adoption and sales of our medicines, we will need to continue developing our commercial organization as well as recruit and retain qualified sales representatives.\nPart of our strategy is to continue to build a biotech company to successfully execute the commercialization of our medicines in the U.S. market, and in selected markets outside the United States where we have commercial rights. We may not be able to successfully commercialize our medicines in the United States or in any other territories where we have commercial rights. In order to commercialize any approved medicines, we must continue to build our sales, marketing, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 460 sales representatives in the field, consisting of approximately 215 orphan sales representatives and 245 inflammation sales representatives. We currently have limited resources compared to some of our competitors, and the continued development of our own commercial organization to market our medicines and any additional medicines we may acquire will be expensive and time-consuming. We also cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to successfully develop this capability.\nAs we continue to add medicines through development efforts and acquisition transactions, the members of our sales force may have limited experience promoting certain of our medicines. To the extent we employ an acquired entity\u2019s sales forces to promote acquired medicines, we may not be successful in continuing to retain these employees and we otherwise will have limited experience marketing these medicines under our commercial organization. In addition, none of the members of our sales force have promoted TEPEZZA or any other medicine for the treatment of TED prior to the launch of TEPEZZA. We are required to expend significant time and resources to train our sales force to be credible and able to educate physicians on the benefits of prescribing and pharmacists dispensing our medicines. In addition, we must train our sales force to ensure that a consistent and appropriate message about our medicines is being delivered to our potential customers. Our sales representatives may also experience challenges promoting multiple medicines when we call on physicians and their office staff. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, turnover of the sales representatives that we hired or will hire, requiring us to train new sales representatives. If we are unable to effectively train our sales force and equip them with effective materials, including medical and sales literature to help them inform and educate physicians about the benefits of our medicines and their proper administration and label indication, as well as our patient assistance programs, our efforts to successfully commercialize our medicines could be put in jeopardy, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, share price and operations. For example, we have had to train our sales force to operate in a virtual environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic and are continuing to learn and implement new strategies and techniques to promote our medicines without the benefit of in-person interactions with healthcare providers and their staff. We may not be successful in finding effective ways to promote our medicines remotely or our competitors may be more successful than we are at adapting to virtual marketing.\nAs a result of the evolving role of various constituents in the prescription decision making process, we focus on hiring sales representatives for our inflammation segment medicines with successful business to business experience. For example, we have faced challenges due to pharmacists switching a patient\u2019s intended prescription from DUEXIS to a generic or over-the-counter brand of their active ingredients, despite such substitution being off-label in the case of DUEXIS. We have faced similar challenges for PENNSAID 2% and RAYOS with respect to generic brands. While we believe the profile of our representatives is suited for this environment, we cannot be certain that our representatives will be able to successfully protect our market for PENNSAID 2%, DUEXIS and RAYOS or that we will be able to continue attracting and retaining sales representatives with our desired profile and skills. We will also have to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain commercial personnel. To the extent we rely on additional third parties to commercialize any approved medicines, we may receive less revenue than if we commercialized these medicines ourselves. In addition, we may have little or no control over the sales efforts of any third parties involved in our commercialization efforts. In the event we are unable to successfully develop and maintain our own commercial organization or collaborate with a third-party sales and marketing organization, we may not be able to commercialize our medicines and medicine candidates and execute on our business plan.\nCoverage and reimbursement may not be available, or reimbursement may be available at only limited levels, for our\nmedicines, which could make it difficult for us to sell our medicines profitably or to successfully execute planned medicine price increases.\nMarket acceptance and sales of our medicines will depend in large part on global coverage and reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures, both in the United States and other key international markets. Successful commercialization of our medicines will depend in part on the availability of governmental and third-party payer reimbursement for the cost of our medicines. Government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally provide reimbursement for healthcare. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payers often provide reimbursement for medicines and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. In the United States, the European Union, or EU, and other significant or potentially significant markets for our medicines and medicine candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medicines and services, particularly for new and innovative medicines and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. Further, the increased scrutiny of prescription drug pricing practices and emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the EU and other significant or potentially significant markets will put additional pressure on medicine pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our medicine sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. These pressures may create negative reactions to any medicine price increases, or limit the amount by which we may be able to increase our medicine prices, which may adversely affect our medicine sales and results of operations.\nWe expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our medicines due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals relating to outcomes and quality. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, increased the mandated Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1%, expanded the rebate to Medicaid managed care utilization and increased the types of entities eligible for the federal 340B drug discount program. As concerns continue to grow over the need for tighter oversight, there remains the possibility that the Health Resources and Services Administration or another agency under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, will propose a similar regulation or that Congress will explore changes to the 340B program through legislation. For example, a bill was introduced in 2018 that would require hospitals to report their low-income utilization of the program. Further, the CMS issued a final rule in 2018 that implemented civil monetary penalties for manufacturers who exceeded the ceiling price methodology for a covered outpatient drug when selling to a 340B covered entity. Pursuant to the final rule, after January 1, 2019, manufacturers must calculate 340B program ceiling prices on a quarterly basis. Moreover, manufacturers could be subject to a $5,000 penalty for each instance where they knowingly and intentionally overcharge a covered entity under the 340B program. With respect to KRYSTEXXA, the \u201cadditional rebate\u201d methodology of the 340B pricing rules, as applied to the historical pricing of KRYSTEXXA both before and after we acquired the medicine, have resulted in a 340B ceiling price of one penny. A material portion of KRYSTEXXA prescriptions (normally in the range of 15 percent to 20 percent) are written by healthcare providers that are eligible for 340B drug pricing and therefore the reduction in 340B pricing to a penny has negatively impacted our net sales of KRYSTEXXA. The CMS had also finalized a proposal in calendar years 2018, 2019 and 2020 that would revise the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system by creating a new, significantly reduced reimbursement methodology for drugs purchased under the 340B program for Medicare patients at hospital and other settings. These reductions were upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in July 2020, and it is unclear whether this matter will be subject to further litigation. Further, the CMS final rule for calendar year 2021 continues these reductions for drugs acquired through the 340B program.\nPatients are unlikely to use our medicines unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our medicines. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific medicines on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved medicines for a particular indication. Moreover, a third-party payer\u2019s decision to provide coverage for a medicine does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Additionally, one third-party payer\u2019s decision to cover a particular medicine does not ensure that other payers will also provide coverage for the medicine, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. Even though we have contracts with some PBMs in the United States, that does not guarantee that they will perform in accordance with the contracts, nor does that preclude them from taking adverse actions against us, which could materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the existence of such PBM contracts does not guarantee coverage by such PBM\u2019s contracted health plans or adequate reimbursement to their respective providers for our medicines. For example, some PBMs have placed some of our medicines on their exclusion lists from time to time, which has resulted in a loss of coverage for patients whose healthcare plans have adopted these PBM lists. Additional healthcare plan formularies may also exclude our medicines from coverage due to the actions of certain PBMs, future price increases we may implement, our use of the HorizonCares program or other free medicine programs whereby we assist qualified patients with certain out-of-pocket expenditures for our medicine, including donations to patient assistance programs offered by charitable foundations, or any other co-pay programs, or other reasons. If our strategies to mitigate formulary exclusions are not effective, these events may reduce the likelihood that physicians prescribe our medicines and increase the likelihood that prescriptions for our medicines are not filled.\nIn light of such policies and the uncertainty surrounding proposed regulations and changes in the coverage and reimbursement policies of governments and third-party payers, we cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any of our medicines in any additional markets or for any other medicine candidates that we may develop. Also, we cannot be sure that reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our medicines. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or are available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our medicines.\nThere may be additional pressure by payers, healthcare providers, state governments, federal regulators and Congress, to use generic drugs that contain the active ingredients found in our medicines or any other medicine candidates that we may develop or acquire. If we fail to successfully secure and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement for our medicines or are significantly delayed in doing so, we will have difficulty achieving market acceptance of our medicines and expected revenue and profitability which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe may also experience pressure from payers as well as state and federal government authorities concerning certain promotional approaches that we may implement such as our HorizonCares program or any other co-pay programs. Certain state and federal enforcement authorities and members of Congress have initiated inquiries about co-pay assistance programs. Some state legislatures have implemented or have been considering implementing laws to restrict or ban co-pay coupons for branded drugs. For example, legislation was signed into law in California that would limit the use of co-pay coupons in cases where a lower cost generic drug is available and if individual ingredients in combination therapies are available over the counter at a lower cost. It is possible that similar legislation could be proposed and enacted in additional states. Additionally, numerous organizations, including pharmaceutical manufacturers, have been subject to ongoing litigation, enforcement actions and settlements related to their patient assistance programs and support. If we are unsuccessful with our HorizonCares program or any other co-pay programs, or we alternatively are unable to secure expanded formulary access through additional arrangements with PBMs or other payers, we would be at a competitive disadvantage in terms of pricing versus preferred branded and generic competitors. We may also experience financial pressure in the future which would make it difficult to support investment levels in areas such as managed care contract rebates, HorizonCares and other access tools.\nOur medicines are subject to extensive regulation, and we may not obtain additional regulatory approvals for our medicines.\nThe clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution and other possible activities relating to our medicines and our medicine candidates are, and will be, subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. Failure to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements may, either before or after medicine approval, subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions.\nTo market any drugs or biologics outside of the United States, we and current or future collaborators must comply with numerous and varying regulatory and compliance related requirements of other countries. For example, we are pursuing a global expansion strategy to bring TEPEZZA to patients with TED outside of the United States, including Japan. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional medicine testing and additional administrative review periods, including obtaining reimbursement and pricing approval in select markets. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks associated with FDA approval as well as additional, presently unanticipated, risks. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.\nApplications for regulatory approval, including a marketing authorization application, or MAA, for marketing new drugs in the European Economic Area, or EEA, must be supported by extensive clinical and pre-clinical data, as well as extensive information regarding chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the applicable medicine candidate. The number and types of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for regulatory approval varies depending on the medicine candidate, the disease or the condition that the medicine candidate is designed to target and the regulations applicable to any particular medicine candidate. Despite the time and expense associated with pre-clinical and clinical studies, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to repeat or perform additional pre-clinical studies, CMC studies or clinical trials. Regulatory authorities could delay, limit or deny approval of a medicine candidate for many reasons, including because they:\n\u2022\nmay not deem a medicine candidate to be adequately safe and effective;\n\u2022\nmay not find the data from pre-clinical studies, CMC studies and clinical trials to be sufficient to support a claim of safety and efficacy;\n\u2022\nmay interpret data from pre-clinical studies, CMC studies and clinical trials significantly differently than we do;\n\u2022\nmay not approve the manufacturing processes or facilities associated with our medicine candidates;\n\u2022\nmay conclude that we have not sufficiently demonstrated long-term stability of the formulation for which we are seeking marketing approval;\n\u2022\nmay change approval policies (including with respect to our medicine candidates\u2019 class of drugs) or adopt new regulations; or\n\u2022\nmay not accept a submission due to, among other reasons, the content or formatting of the submission.\nEven if we believe that data collected from our pre-clinical studies, CMC studies and clinical trials of our medicine candidates are promising and that our information and procedures regarding CMC are sufficient, our data may not be sufficient to support marketing approval by regulatory authorities, or regulatory interpretation of these data and procedures may be unfavorable. Even if approved, medicine candidates may not be approved for all indications requested and such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the medicine may be marketed, restricted distribution methods or other limitations. Our business and reputation may be harmed by any failure or significant delay in obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of any of our medicine candidates. We cannot predict when or whether regulatory approval will be obtained for any medicine candidate we develop.\nThe ultimate approval and commercial marketing of any of our medicines in additional indications or geographies is subject to substantial uncertainty. Failure to gain additional regulatory approvals would limit the potential revenues and value of our medicines and could cause our share price to decline.\nSince a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom, or UK, applicable to our business and our products is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit has and will continue to impact the regulatory regime with respect to the development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our products in the UK. Great Britain is no longer covered by the centralized procedures for obtaining EEA-wide marketing authorizations from the European Commission, or EC. Our product candidates require a separate marketing authorization for Great Britain, and it is unclear as to whether the relevant authorities in the EU and the UK are adequately prepared for the additional administrative burden caused by Brexit. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, could prevent us from or delay us commercializing our product candidates in the UK and/or the EEA and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the UK and/or EEA for our product candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business.\nBrexit may influence the attractiveness of the UK as a place to conduct clinical trials. The EU\u2019s regulatory environment for clinical trials is being harmonized as part of the Clinical Trial Regulation but it is currently unclear as to what extent the UK will seek to align its regulations with the EU. Failure of the UK to closely align its regulations with the EU may have an effect on the cost of conducting clinical trials in the UK as opposed to other countries and/or make it harder to seek a marketing authorization for our product candidates in the EU on the basis of clinical trials conducted in the UK.\nIn the short term there is a risk of disrupted import and export processes due to a lack of administrative processing capacity by the respective UK and EU customs agencies that may delay time-sensitive shipments and may negatively impact our product supply chain.\nWe may be subject to penalties and litigation and large incremental expenses if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience problems with our medicines.\nEven after we achieve regulatory approvals, we are subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review with respect to many operational aspects including our manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, storage, adverse event monitoring and reporting, dispensation, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, ongoing maintenance of medicine registration and continued compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, good clinical practices, or GCPs, good pharmacovigilance practice, good distribution practices and good laboratory practices, or GLPs. If we, our medicines or medicine candidates, or the third-party manufacturing facilities for our medicines or medicine candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022\nimpose injunctions or restrictions on the marketing, manufacturing or distribution of a medicine, suspend or withdraw medicine approvals, revoke necessary licenses or suspend medicine reimbursement;\n\u2022\nissue warning letters, show cause notices or untitled letters describing alleged violations, which may be publicly available;\n\u2022\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials or delay or prevent the initiation of clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelay or refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications we have filed;\n\u2022\nrefuse to permit drugs or precursor or intermediary chemicals to be imported or exported to or from the United States;\n\u2022\nsuspend or impose restrictions or additional requirements on operations, including costly new manufacturing quality or pharmacovigilance requirements;\n\u2022\nseize or detain medicines or require us to initiate a medicine recall; and/or\n\u2022\ncommence criminal investigations and prosecutions.\nMoreover, existing regulatory approvals and any future regulatory approvals that we obtain will be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses and patient populations for which our medicines may be marketed, the conditions of approval, requirements for potentially costly, post-market testing and requirements for surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the medicines. Physicians nevertheless may prescribe our medicines to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label or that is off-label. Positive clinical trial results in any of our medicine development programs increase the risk that approved pharmaceutical forms of the same active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, may be used off-label in those indications. If we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses of approved medicines, we may be subject to significant sanctions, civil and criminal fines and injunctions prohibiting us from engaging in specified promotional conduct.\nIn addition, engaging in improper promotion of our medicines for off-label uses in the United States can subject us to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes. These false claims statutes in the United States include the federal False Claims Act, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company on behalf of the federal government alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims or causing to present such false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal program such as Medicare or Medicaid. Growth in false claims litigation has increased the risk that a pharmaceutical company will have to defend a false claim action, pay civil money penalties, settlement fines or restitution, agree to comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations and be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.\nThe regulations, policies or guidance of regulatory agencies may change and new or additional statutes or government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our medicine candidates or further restrict or regulate post-approval activities. For example, in January 2014, the FDA released draft guidance on how drug companies can fulfill their regulatory requirements for post-marketing submission of interactive promotional media, and though the guidance provided insight into how the FDA views a company\u2019s responsibility for certain types of social media promotion, there remains a substantial amount of uncertainty regarding internet and social media promotion of regulated medical products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from pending or future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are unable to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance, we will not be permitted to market our drugs, which would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have rights to medicines in certain jurisdictions but have no control over third parties that have rights to commercialize those medicines in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our commercialization of these medicines.\nFollowing our sale of the rights to RAVICTI (i) outside of North America and Japan to Medical Need Europe AB, part of the Immedica Group, or Immedica, in December 2018 and (ii) in Japan to Immedica, Immedica has marketing and distribution rights to RAVICTI in those regions. Following our sale of the rights to PROCYSBI in the Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, regions to Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A., or Chiesi, in June 2017, or the Chiesi divestiture, Chiesi has marketing and distribution rights to PROCYSBI in the EMEA regions. Miravo Healthcare (formerly known as Nuvo Pharmaceuticals Inc.), or Miravo, has retained its rights to PENNSAID 2% in territories outside of the United States. In March 2017, Miravo announced that it had entered into an exclusive license agreement with Sayre Therapeutics PVT Ltd. to distribute, market and sell PENNSAID 2% in India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal, and in December 2017 Miravo announced that it had entered into a license and distribution agreement with Gebro Pharma AG for the exclusive right to register, distribute, market and sell PENNSAID 2% in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. We have little or no control over Immedica\u2019s activities with respect to RAVICTI outside of North America, over Chiesi\u2019s activities with respect to PROCYSBI in the EMEA, or over Miravo\u2019s or its existing and future commercial partners\u2019 activities with respect to PENNSAID 2% outside of the United States even though those activities could impact our ability to successfully commercialize these medicines. For example, Immedica or its assignees, Chiesi or its assignees or Miravo or its assignees can make statements or use promotional materials with respect to RAVICTI, PROCYSBI or PENNSAID 2% , respectively, outside of the United States that are inconsistent with our positioning of the medicines in the United States, and could sell RAVICTI, PROCYSBI or PENNSAID 2%, respectively, in foreign countries at prices that are dramatically lower than the prices we charge in the United States. These activities and decisions, while occurring outside of the United States, could harm our commercialization strategy in the United States. In addition, medicine recalls or safety issues with these medicines outside the United States, even if not related to the commercial medicine we sell in the United States, could result in serious damage to the brand in the United States and impair our ability to successfully market them. We also rely on Immedica, Chiesi and Miravo, or their assignees to provide us with timely and accurate safety information regarding the use of these medicines outside of the United States, as we have or will have limited access to this information ourselves.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture commercial supplies of all of our medicines, and we currently intend to rely on third parties to manufacture commercial supplies of any other approved medicines. The commercialization of any of our medicines could be stopped, delayed or made less profitable if those third parties fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of medicine or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices or fail to maintain or achieve satisfactory regulatory compliance.\nThe facilities used by our third-party manufacturers to manufacture our medicines and medicine candidates must be approved by the applicable regulatory authorities. We do not control the manufacturing processes of third-party manufacturers and are currently completely dependent on our third-party manufacturing partners.\nWe rely on AGC Biologics A/S (formerly known as CMC Biologics A/S), or AGC Biologics, as our exclusive manufacturer of the TEPEZZA drug substance and Catalent Indiana, LLC, or Catalent, for TEPEZZA drug product. On December 17, 2020, we announced that we expected a short-term disruption in TEPEZZA supply as a result of recent U.S. government-mandated COVID-19 vaccine production orders pursuant to the DPA that dramatically restricted capacity available for the production of TEPEZZA at our drug product contract manufacturer, Catalent. To offset the reduced slots allowed by the DPA and Catalent, we accelerated plans to increase the production scale of TEPEZZA drug product. In January 2021, we submitted a prior approval supplement to the FDA to support increased scale production of TEPEZZA drug product for the treatment of TED. The submission includes data to support more product output with each manufacturing slot than is currently approved by the FDA. We will continue to discuss potential additional data requirements and approval timeline with the FDA, but we cannot guarantee when the FDA will approve the submission, if at all. We continue to anticipate the disruption could last through the first quarter of 2021, however the length of the TEPEZZA supply disruption will depend on future manufacturing slots and whether future manufacturing slots are successfully completed, as well as on decisions by the FDA regarding the increased scale manufacturing process of TEPEZZA. While we are not currently aware of any manufacturing facilities other than Catalent that are part of the supply chain for our medicines that are being utilized for the manufacture of vaccines for COVID-19, similar circumstances could arise in the future and could result in supply disruption to our other medicines.\nFurther, following the highly successful launch of TEPEZZA, which significantly exceeded expectations, we began the process of expanding our production capacity in 2020 to meet anticipated future demand for TEPEZZA. If AGC Biologics fails to supply TEPEZZA drug substance or if Catalent fails to supply TEPEZZA drug product for a period beyond our current expectation or either manufacturer is otherwise unable to meet our volume requirements due to unexpected market demand for TEPEZZA, it may lead to further TEPEZZA supply constraints. We rely on NOF Corporation, or NOF, as our exclusive supplier of the PEGylation agent that is a critical raw material in the manufacture of KRYSTEXXA. If NOF fails to supply such PEGylation agent, it may lead to KRYSTEXXA supply constraints. A key excipient used in PENNSAID 2% as a penetration enhancer is dimethyl sulfoxide, or DMSO. We and Miravo, our exclusive supplier of PENNSAID 2%, rely on a sole proprietary form of DMSO for which we maintain a substantial safety stock. However, should this supply become inadequate, damaged, destroyed or unusable, we and Miravo may not be able to qualify a second source. We rely on an exclusive supply agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals, for manufacturing and supply of ACTIMMUNE. ACTIMMUNE is manufactured by starting with cells from working cell bank samples which are derived from a master cell bank. We and Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals separately store multiple vials of the master cell bank. In the event of catastrophic loss at our or Boehringer Ingelheim Biopharmaceuticals\u2019 storage facility, it is possible that we could lose multiple cell banks and have the manufacturing capacity of ACTIMMUNE severely impacted by the need to substitute or replace the cell banks.\nIf any of our third-party manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the applicable regulatory authorities\u2019 strict regulatory requirements, or pass regulatory inspection, they will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for the manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of third-party manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or any other applicable regulatory authorities do not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our medicines or if they withdraw any such approval in the future, or if our suppliers or third-party manufacturers decide they no longer want to supply our primary active ingredients or manufacture our medicines, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our medicines. To the extent any third-party manufacturers that we engage with respect to our medicines are different from those currently being used for commercial supply in the United States, the FDA will need to approve the facilities of those third-party manufacturers used in the manufacture of our medicines prior to our sale of any medicine using these facilities.\nAlthough we have entered into supply agreements for the manufacture and packaging of our medicines, our manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may terminate their agreements with us. We currently rely on single source suppliers for certain of our medicines. If our manufacturers terminate their agreements with us, we may have to qualify new back-up manufacturers. We rely on safety stock to mitigate the risk of our current suppliers electing to cease producing bulk drug product or ceasing to do so at acceptable prices and quality. However, we can provide no assurance that such safety stocks would be sufficient to avoid supply shortfalls in the event we have to identify and qualify new contract manufacturers.\nThe manufacture of medicines requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of medicines often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up and validating initial production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the medicine, quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. Furthermore, if microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in the medicines or in the manufacturing facilities in which our medicines are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. We cannot assure that issues relating to the manufacture of any of our medicines will not occur in the future. Additionally, our manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations, our ability to commercialize our medicines or provide any medicine candidates to patients in clinical trials would be jeopardized.\nAny delay or interruption in our ability to meet commercial demand for our medicines will result in the loss of potential revenues and could adversely affect our ability to gain market acceptance for these medicines. In addition, any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely.\nFailures or difficulties faced at any level of our supply chain, including any further potential disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, could materially adversely affect our business and delay or impede the development and commercialization of any of our medicines or medicine candidates and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including those marketing generic medicines and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive. We have competitors both in the United States and international markets, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, such as larger research and development staff, experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations and well-established sales forces. Additional consolidations in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors and we will have to find new ways to compete and may have to potentially merge with or acquire other businesses to stay competitive. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or in-licensing on an exclusive basis, medicines that are more effective and/or less costly than our medicines.\nAlthough TEPEZZA does not face direct competition, other therapies, such as corticosteroids, have been used on an off-label basis to alleviate some of the symptoms of TED. While these therapies have not proved effective in treating the underlying disease, and carry with them significant side effects, their off-label use could reduce or delay treatment in the addressable patient population for TEPEZZA. Immunovant Inc., or Immunovant, is conducting Phase 2 clinical trials of a fully human anti-FcRn monoclonal antibody candidate for the treatment of active TED, also referred to as Graves\u2019 ophthalmopathy. On February 2, 2021, Immunovant announced a voluntary pause in the clinical dosing of the candidate due to elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels in patients treated with the candidate. Immunovant has indicated it intends to continue developing the candidate but did not provide an estimate of when the dosing might resume. Viridian Therapeutics, Inc. is pursuing development of an anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody for TED and has announced plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial in the second half of 2021. While KRYSTEXXA faces limited direct competition, a number of competitors have medicines in clinical trials, including Selecta Biosciences Inc., or Selecta, which has initiated a Phase 3 trial of a candidate for the treatment of chronic refractory gout. In September 2020, Selecta announced topline clinical data that did not meet the primary endpoint or demonstrate statistical superiority for their Phase 2 trial that compared their candidate, which includes an immunomodulator, to KRYSTEXXA alone. In July 2020, Selecta and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB, or Sobi, entered into a strategic licensing agreement under which Sobi will assume responsibility for certain development, regulatory, and commercial activities for this candidate. RAVICTI could face competition from a few medicine candidates that are in early-stage development, including a gene-therapy candidate by Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc., a generic taste-masked formulation option of BUPHENYL by ACER Therapeutics Inc., an enzyme replacement for a specific UCD subtype (ARG) by Aeglea Bio Therapeutics Inc. and a mRNA-based therapeutic for a specific UCD subtype (OTC) by Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc. PROCYSBI faces competition from Cystagon (immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate capsules) for the treatment of cystinosis, Cystadrops (cysteamine ophthalmic solution) for the treatment of corneal cystine crystal deposits and Cystaran (cysteamine ophthalmic solution) for treatment of corneal crystal accumulation in patients with cystinosis. Additionally, we are also aware that AVROBIO, Inc. has an early-stage gene therapy candidate in development for the treatment of cystinosis. PENNSAID 2% faces competition from generic versions of diclofenac sodium topical solutions that are priced significantly less than the price we charge for PENNSAID 2%. The generic version of Voltaren Gel is the market leader in the topical NSAID category. Legislation enacted in most states in the United States allows, or in some instances mandates, that a pharmacist dispense an available generic equivalent when filling a prescription for a branded medicine, in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician. DUEXIS faces competition from other NSAIDs, including Celebrex\u00ae, marketed by Pfizer Inc., and celecoxib, a generic form of the medicine marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. DUEXIS also faces significant competition from the separate use of NSAIDs for pain relief and GI protective medications to reduce the risk of NSAID-induced upper GI ulcers. Both NSAIDs and GI protective medications are available in generic form and may be less expensive to use separately than DUEXIS, despite such substitution being off-label in the case of DUEXIS. Because pharmacists often have economic and other incentives to prescribe lower-cost generics, if physicians prescribe PENNSAID 2% or DUEXIS, those prescriptions may not result in sales. If physicians do not complete prescriptions through our HorizonCares program or otherwise provide prescribing instructions prohibiting generic diclofenac sodium topical solutions as a substitute for PENNSAID 2%, the substitution of generic ibuprofen and famotidine separately as a substitution for DUEXIS, sales of PENNSAID 2% and DUEXIS may suffer despite any success we may have in promoting PENNSAID 2% or DUEXIS to physicians. In addition, other medicine candidates that contain ibuprofen and famotidine in combination or naproxen and esomeprazole in combination, while not currently known or FDA approved, may be developed and compete with DUEXIS in the future.\nWe have also entered into settlement and license agreements that may allow certain of our competitors to sell generic versions of certain of our medicines in the United States, subject to the terms of such agreements. We granted (i) a non-exclusive license (that is only royalty-bearing in some circumstances) to manufacture and commercialize a generic version of DUEXIS in the United States after January 1, 2023, (ii) non-exclusive licenses to manufacture and commercialize generic versions of PENNSAID 2% in the United States after October 17, 2027, (iii) a non-exclusive license to manufacture and commercialize a generic version of RAYOS tablets in the United States after December 23, 2022, and (iv) non-exclusive licenses to manufacture and commercialize generic versions of RAVICTI in the United States after July 1, 2025, or earlier under certain circumstances.\nPatent litigation is currently pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Actavis Laboratories UT, Inc., formerly known as Watson Laboratories, Inc., Actavis, Inc. and Actavis plc, or collectively Actavis, who intend to market a generic version of PENNSAID 2% prior to the expiration of certain of our patents listed in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book, or the Orange Book. These cases arise from Paragraph IV Patent Certification notice letters from Actavis advising it had filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of PENNSAID 2% before the expiration of the patents-in-suit.\nOn February 27, 2020, following a judgment in federal court invalidating certain patents covering VIMOVO, Dr. Reddy\u2019s launched a generic version of VIMOVO in the United States. While patent litigation against Dr. Reddy\u2019s for infringement continues on additional patents in the New Jersey District Court, we now face generic competition for VIMOVO, which has negatively impacted net sales of VIMOVO in 2020. As a result, we have repositioned our promotional efforts previously directed to VIMOVO to the other inflammation segment medicines and expect that our VIMOVO net sales will continue to decrease in future periods.\nPatent litigation is currently pending in the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals and the United States District Court of New Jersey against Alkem Laboratories, Inc., or Alkem, and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., or Teva USA, respectively, who each intend to market a generic version of DUEXIS prior to the expiration of certain of our patents listed in the Orange Book. These cases arise from Paragraph IV Patent Certification notice letters from Alkem and Teva USA advising they had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of DUEXIS before the expiration of the patents-in-suit.\nOn June 27, 2020, we received notice from Lupin Limited, or Lupin, that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking approval of a generic version of PROCYSBI. The ANDA contained a Paragraph IV Patent Certification alleging that the patents covering PROCYSBI are invalid and/or will not be infringed by Lupin\u2019s manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of PROCYSBI. Patent litigation is currently pending in the United States District Court of New Jersey against Lupin seeking to prevent Lupin from selling its generic version of PROCYSBI before the expiration of the patents-in-suit.\nIf we are unsuccessful in any of the PENNSAID 2% cases, DUEXIS cases or PROCYSBI case, we will likely face generic competition with respect to PENNSAID 2%, DUEXIS, and/or PROCYSBI and sales of PENNSAID 2%, DUEXIS, and/or PROCYSBI will be substantially harmed.\nACTIMMUNE is the only medicine currently approved by the FDA specifically for the treatment of CGD and SMO. While there are additional or alternative approaches used to treat patients with CGD and SMO, there are currently no medicines on the market that compete directly with ACTIMMUNE. A widely accepted protocol to treat CGD in the United States is the use of concomitant \u201ctriple prophylactic therapy\u201d comprising ACTIMMUNE, an oral antibiotic agent and an oral antifungal agent. However, the FDA-approved labeling for ACTIMMUNE does not discuss this \u201ctriple prophylactic therapy,\u201d and physicians may choose to prescribe one or both of the other modalities in the absence of ACTIMMUNE. Because of the immediate and life-threatening nature of SMO, the preferred treatment option for SMO is often to have the patient undergo a bone marrow transplant which, if successful, will likely obviate the need for further use of ACTIMMUNE in that patient. Likewise, the use of bone marrow transplants in the treatment of patients with CGD is becoming more prevalent, which could have a material adverse effect on sales of ACTIMMUNE and its profitability. We are aware of a number of research programs investigating the potential of gene therapy as a possible cure for CGD. Additionally, other companies may be pursuing the development of medicines and treatments that target the same diseases and conditions which ACTIMMUNE is currently approved to treat. As a result, it is possible that our competitors may develop new medicines that manage CGD or SMO more effectively, cost less or possibly even cure CGD or SMO. In addition, U.S. healthcare legislation passed in March 2010 authorized the FDA to approve biological products, known as biosimilars, that are similar to or interchangeable with previously approved biological products, like ACTIMMUNE, based upon potentially abbreviated data packages. Biosimilars are likely to be sold at substantially lower prices than branded medicines because the biosimilar manufacturer would not have to recoup the research and development and marketing costs associated with the branded medicine. Though we are not currently aware of any biosimilar under development, the development and commercialization of any competing medicines or the discovery of any new alternative treatment for CGD or SMO could have a material adverse effect on sales of ACTIMMUNE and its profitability. We have licenses to U.S. patents covering ACTIMMUNE. If not otherwise invalidated, those patents expire in 2022.\nBUPHENYL\u2019s composition of matter patent protection and orphan drug exclusivity have expired. Because BUPHENYL has no regulatory exclusivity or listed patents, there is nothing to prevent a competitor from submitting an ANDA for a generic version of BUPHENYL and receiving FDA approval. Generic versions of BUPHENYL to date have been priced at a discount relative to RAVICTI, and physicians, patients, or payers may decide that this less expensive alternative is preferable to RAVICTI. If this occurs, sales of RAVICTI could be materially reduced, but we would nevertheless be required to make royalty payments to Bausch Health Companies Inc. (formerly Ucyclyd Pharma, Inc.), or Bausch, and another external party, at the same royalty rates. While Bausch and its affiliates are generally contractually prohibited from developing or commercializing new medicines, anywhere in the world, for the treatment of UCD or hepatic encephalopathy, or HE, which are chemically similar to RAVICTI, they may still develop and commercialize medicines that compete with RAVICTI. For example, medicines approved for indications other than UCD and HE may still compete with RAVICTI if physicians prescribe such medicines off-label for UCD or HE. We are also aware that Recordati S.p.A (formerly known as Orphan Europe SARL), or Recordati, is conducting clinical trials of carglumic acid to assess the efficacy for acute hyperammonemia in some of the UCD enzyme deficiencies for which RAVICTI is approved for chronic treatment. Carglumic acid is approved for maintenance therapy for chronic hyperammonemia and to treat hyperammonemic crises in N-acetylglutamate synthase deficiency, a rare UCD subtype, and is sold under the name Carbaglu. If the results of this trial are successful and Recordati is able to complete development and obtain approval of Carbaglu to treat additional UCD enzyme deficiencies, RAVICTI may face additional competition from this compound.\nThe availability and price of our competitors\u2019 medicines could limit the demand, and the price we are able to charge, for our medicines. We will not successfully execute on our business objectives if the market acceptance of our medicines is inhibited by price competition, if physicians are reluctant to switch from existing medicines to our medicines, or if physicians switch to other new medicines or choose to reserve our medicines for use in limited patient populations.\nIn addition, established pharmaceutical companies may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to acquire novel compounds that could make our medicines obsolete. Our ability to compete successfully with these companies and other potential competitors will depend largely on our ability to leverage our experience in clinical, regulatory and commercial development to:\n\u2022\ndevelop and acquire medicines that are superior to other medicines in the market;\n\u2022\nattract qualified clinical, regulatory, and sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nobtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for our medicines and technologies;\n\u2022\nobtain required regulatory approvals; and\n\u2022\nsuccessfully collaborate with pharmaceutical companies in the discovery, development and commercialization of new medicine candidates.\nIf we are unable to maintain or realize the benefits of orphan drug exclusivity, we may face increased competition with respect to certain of our medicines.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may designate a medicine as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. A company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for the specified rare disease or condition receives orphan drug marketing exclusivity for that drug for a period of seven years from the date of its approval. PROCYSBI received ten years of market exclusivity, through 2023, as an orphan drug in Europe. PROCYSBI received seven years of market exclusivity, through 2022, for patients two years of age to less than six years of age, and seven years of market exclusivity, through 2024, for patients one year of age to less than two years of age, as an orphan drug in the United States. In addition, TEPEZZA has been granted orphan drug exclusivity for treatment of active (dynamic) phase Graves\u2019 ophthalmopathy, which we expect will provide orphan drug marketing exclusivity in the United States until January 2027. However, despite orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA can still approve another drug containing the same active ingredient and used for the same orphan indication if it determines that a subsequent drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care, and orphan exclusivity can be lost if the orphan drug manufacturer is unable to ensure that a sufficient quantity of the orphan drug is available to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Orphan drug exclusivity may also be lost if the FDA later determines that the initial request for designation was materially defective. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving competing drugs for the same or similar indication containing a different active ingredient. If orphan drug exclusivity is lost and we were unable to successfully enforce any remaining patents covering the applicable medicine, we could be subject to generic competition and revenues from the medicine could decrease materially. In addition, if a subsequent drug is approved for marketing for the same or a similar indication as our medicines despite orphan drug exclusivity, we may face increased competition and lose market share with respect to these medicines.\nIf we cannot successfully implement our patient assistance programs or increase formulary access and reimbursement for our medicines in the face of increasing pressure to reduce the price of medications, the adoption of our medicines by physicians, patients and payers may decline.\nThere continues to be immense pressure from healthcare payers, PBMs and others to use less expensive or generic medicines or over-the-counter brands instead of certain branded medicines. For example, some PBMs have placed certain of our medicines on their exclusion lists from time to time, which has resulted in a loss of coverage for patients whose healthcare plans have adopted these PBM lists. Additional healthcare plans, including those that contract with these PBMs but use different formularies, may also choose to exclude our medicines from their formularies or restrict coverage to situations where a generic or over-the-counter medicine has been tried first. Many payers and PBMs also require patients to make co-payments for branded medicines, including many of our medicines, in order to incentivize the use of generic or other lower-priced alternatives instead. Legislation enacted in most states in the United States allows, or in some instances mandates, that a pharmacist dispenses an available generic equivalent when filling a prescription for a branded medicine, in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician. Because our medicines (other than BUPHENYL and VIMOVO) do not currently have FDA-approved generic equivalents in the United States, we do not believe our medicines should be subject to mandatory generic substitution laws. We understand that some pharmacies may attempt to obtain physician authorization to switch prescriptions for DUEXIS to prescriptions for multiple generic medicines with similar APIs to ensure payment for the medicine if the physician\u2019s prescription for the branded medicine is not immediately covered by the payer, despite such substitution being off-label in the case of DUEXIS. If these limitations in coverage and other incentives result in patients refusing to fill prescriptions or being dissatisfied with the out-of-pocket costs of their medications, or if pharmacies otherwise seek and receive physician authorization to switch prescriptions, not only would we lose sales on prescriptions that are ultimately not filled, but physicians may be dissuaded from writing prescriptions for our medicines in the first place in order to avoid potential patient non-compliance or dissatisfaction over medication costs, or to avoid spending the time and effort of responding to pharmacy requests to switch prescriptions.\nPart of our commercial strategy to increase adoption and access to our medicines in the face of these incentives to use generic alternatives is to offer physicians the opportunity to have eligible patients fill prescriptions through independent pharmacies participating in our HorizonCares patient assistance program, including shipment of prescriptions to patients. We also have contracted with a third-party prescription clearinghouse that offers physicians a single point of contact for processing prescriptions through these independent pharmacies, reducing physician administrative costs, increasing the fill rates for prescriptions and enabling physicians to monitor refill activity. Through HorizonCares, financial assistance may be available to reduce eligible patients\u2019 out-of-pocket costs for prescriptions filled. Because of this assistance, eligible patients\u2019 out-of-pocket cost for our medicines when dispensed through HorizonCares may be significantly lower than such costs when our medicines are dispensed outside of the HorizonCares program. However, to the extent physicians do not direct prescriptions currently filled through traditional pharmacies, including those associated with or controlled by PBMs, to pharmacies participating in our HorizonCares program, we may experience a significant decline in PENNSAID 2% and DUEXIS prescriptions. Our ability to increase utilization of our patient assistance programs will depend on physician and patient awareness and comfort with the programs, and we do not control whether physicians will ultimately use our patient assistance programs to prescribe our medicines or whether patients will agree to receive our medicines through our HorizonCares program. In addition, the HorizonCares program is not available to federal health care program (such as Medicare and Medicaid) beneficiaries. We have also contracted with certain PBMs and other payers to secure formulary status and reimbursement for certain of our inflammation segment medicines, which generally require us to pay administrative fees and rebates to the PBMs and other payers for qualifying prescriptions. While we have business relationships with two of the largest PBMs, Express Scripts, Inc., or Express Scripts, and CVS Caremark, as well as rebate agreements with other PBMs, and we believe these agreements will secure formulary status for certain of our medicines, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to agree to terms with other PBMs and other payers, or that such terms will be commercially reasonable to us. Despite our agreements with PBMs, the extent of formulary status and reimbursement will ultimately depend to a large extent upon individual healthcare plan formulary decisions. If healthcare plans that contract with PBMs with which we have agreements do not adopt formulary changes recommended by the PBMs with respect to our medicines, we may not realize the expected access and reimbursement benefits from these agreements. In addition, we generally pay higher rebates for prescriptions covered under plans that adopt a PBM-chosen formulary than for plans that adopt custom formularies. Consequently, the success of our PBM contracting strategy will depend not only on our ability to expand formulary adoption among healthcare plans, but also upon the relative mix of healthcare plans that have PBM-chosen formularies versus custom formularies. If we are unable to realize the expected benefits of our contractual arrangements with the PBMs we may continue to experience reductions in net sales from our inflammation segment medicines and/or reductions in net pricing for our inflammation segment medicines due to increasing patient assistance costs. If we are unable to increase adoption of HorizonCares for filling prescriptions of our medicines and to secure formulary status and reimbursement through arrangements with PBMs and other payers, particularly with healthcare plans that use custom formularies, our ability to achieve net sales growth for our inflammation segment medicines would be impaired.\nThere has been negative publicity and inquiries from Congress and enforcement authorities regarding the use of specialty pharmacies and drug pricing. Our patient assistance programs are not involved in the prescribing of medicines and are solely to assist in ensuring that when a physician determines one of our medicines offers a potential clinical benefit to their patients and they prescribe one for an eligible patient, financial assistance may be available to reduce the patient\u2019s out-of-pocket costs. In addition, all pharmacies that fill prescriptions for our medicines are fully independent, including those that participate in HorizonCares. We do not own or possess any option to purchase an ownership stake in any pharmacy that distributes our medicines, and our relationship with each pharmacy is non-exclusive and arm\u2019s length. All of our sales are processed through pharmacies independent of us. Despite this, the negative publicity and interest from Congress and enforcement authorities regarding specialty pharmacies may result in physicians being less willing to participate in our patient assistance programs and thereby limit our ability to increase patient assistance and adoption of our medicines.\nWe may also encounter difficulty in forming and maintaining relationships with pharmacies that participate in our patient assistance programs. We currently depend on a limited number of pharmacies participating in HorizonCares to fulfill patient prescriptions under the HorizonCares program. If these HorizonCares participating pharmacies are unable to process and fulfill the volume of patient prescriptions directed to them under the HorizonCares program, our ability to maintain or increase prescriptions for our medicines will be impaired. The commercialization of our medicines and our operating results could be affected should any of the HorizonCares participating pharmacies choose not to continue participation in our HorizonCares program or by any adverse events at any of those HorizonCares participating pharmacies. For example, pharmacies that dispense our medicines could lose contracts that they currently maintain with managed care organizations, or MCOs, including PBMs. Pharmacies often enter into agreements with MCOs. They may be required to abide by certain terms and conditions to maintain access to MCO networks, including terms and conditions that could limit their ability to participate in patient assistance programs like ours. Failure to comply with the terms of their agreements with MCOs could result in a variety of penalties, including termination of their agreement, which could negatively impact the ability of those pharmacies to dispense our medicines and collect reimbursement from MCOs for such medicines.\nThe HorizonCares program may implicate certain federal and state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, healthcare kickbacks, tortious interference with patient contracts and statutory or common law fraud. We have a comprehensive compliance program in place to address adherence with various laws and regulations relating to the selling, marketing and manufacturing of our medicines, as well as certain third-party relationships, including pharmacies. Specifically, with respect to pharmacies, the compliance program utilizes a variety of methods and tools to monitor and audit pharmacies, including those that participate in the HorizonCares program, to confirm their activities, adjudication and practices are consistent with our compliance policies and guidance. Despite our compliance efforts, to the extent the HorizonCares program is found to be inconsistent with applicable laws or the pharmacies that participate in our patient assistance programs do not comply with applicable laws, we may be required to restructure or discontinue such programs, terminate our relationship with certain pharmacies, or be subject to other significant penalties. In November 2015, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York requesting documents and information related to our patient assistance programs and other aspects of our marketing and commercialization activities. We are unable to predict how long this investigation will continue or its outcome, but we have incurred and anticipate that we may continue to incur significant costs in connection with the investigation, regardless of the outcome. We may also become subject to similar investigations by other governmental agencies or Congress. The investigation by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and any additional investigations of our patient assistance programs and sales and marketing activities may result in significant damages, fines, penalties, exclusion, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight or other administrative sanctions against us.\nIf the cost of maintaining our patient assistance programs increases relative to our sales revenues, we could be forced to reduce the amount of patient financial assistance that we offer or otherwise scale back or eliminate such programs, which could in turn have a negative impact on physicians\u2019 willingness to prescribe and patients\u2019 willingness to fill prescriptions of our medicines. While we believe that our arrangements with PBMs will result in broader inclusion of certain of our inflammation segment medicines on healthcare plan formularies, and therefore increase payer reimbursement and lower our cost of providing patient assistance programs, these arrangements generally require us to pay administrative and rebate payments to the PBMs and/or other payers and their effectiveness will ultimately depend to a large extent upon individual healthcare plan formulary decisions that are beyond the control of the PBMs. If our arrangements with PBMs and other payers do not result in increased prescriptions and reductions in our costs to provide our patient assistance programs that are sufficient to offset the administrative fees and rebate payments to the PBMs and/or other payers, our financial results may continue to be harmed.\nIf we are unable to successfully implement our commercial plans and facilitate adoption by patients and physicians of any approved medicines through our sales, marketing and commercialization efforts, then we will not be able to generate sustainable revenues from medicine sales which will have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nOur business operations may subject us to numerous commercial disputes, claims and/or lawsuits and such litigation may be costly and time-consuming and could materially and adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\nOperating in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly the commercialization of medicines, involves numerous commercial relationships, complex contractual arrangements, uncertain intellectual property rights, potential product liability and other aspects that create heightened risks of disputes, claims and lawsuits. In particular, we may face claims related to the safety of our medicines, intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition, sales and marketing practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition or divestiture-related matters. Any commercial dispute, claim or lawsuit may divert management\u2019s attention away from our business, we may incur significant expenses in addressing or defending any commercial dispute, claim or lawsuit, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nWe are currently in litigation with multiple generic drug manufacturers regarding intellectual property infringement. For example, we are currently involved in Hatch Waxman litigation with generic drug manufacturers related to DUEXIS, PENNSAID 2%, VIMOVO, and PROCYSBI.\nSimilarly, from time to time we are involved in disputes with distributors, PBMs and licensing partners regarding our rights and performance of obligations under contractual arrangements. For example, we were previously in litigation with Express Scripts related to alleged breach of contract claims.\nLitigation related to these disputes may be costly and time-consuming and could materially and adversely impact our financial position and results of operations if resolved against us.\nA variety of risks associated with operating our business internationally could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, we have operations in Ireland, Bermuda, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, or Luxembourg, Switzerland, Germany and in Canada. Furthermore, we are pursuing a global expansion strategy to bring TEPEZZA to patients with TED outside of the United States, including Japan. We face risks associated with our international operations, including possible unfavorable political, tax and labor conditions, which could harm our business. We are subject to numerous risks associated with international business activities, including:\n\u2022\ncompliance with Irish laws and the maintenance of our Irish tax residency with respect to our overall corporate structure and administrative operations, including the need to generally hold meetings of our board of directors and make decisions in Ireland, which may make certain corporate actions more cumbersome, costly and time-consuming;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nforeign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements;\n\u2022\nU.S. and foreign government tariffs, trade restrictions, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nanti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, natural disasters, war, events of terrorism or political instability in particular foreign countries;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations related to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws, regulations and restrictions for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u2022\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships; and\n\u2022\nchallenges in enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States.\nOur business activities outside of the United States are subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate. The FCPA and similar anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to non-U.S. government officials in order to improperly influence any act or decision, secure any other improper advantage, or obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the company and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. As described above, our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, any dealings with these prescribers and purchasers may be subject to regulation under the FCPA. Recently the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, private individuals who report to the SEC original information that leads to successful enforcement actions may be eligible for a monetary award. We are engaged in ongoing efforts that are designed to ensure our compliance with these laws, including due diligence, training, policies, procedures and internal controls. However, there is no certainty that all employees and third-party business partners (including our distributors, wholesalers, agents, contractors, and other partners) will comply with anti-bribery laws. In particular, we do not control the actions of manufacturers and other third-party agents, although we may be liable for their actions. Violation of these laws may result in civil or criminal sanctions, which could include monetary fines, criminal penalties, and disgorgement of past profits, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nWe are subject to tax audits around the world, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our recorded income tax provisions and accruals. The ultimate results of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made and could result in increases to our overall tax expense in subsequent periods.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to develop or acquire other medicine candidates or medicines, our business and prospects would be limited.\nA key element of our strategy is to develop or acquire and commercialize a portfolio of other medicines or medicine candidates in addition to our current medicines, through business or medicine acquisitions such as our pending acquisition of Viela Bio, Inc. or Viela. Because we do not engage in proprietary drug discovery, the success of this strategy depends in large part upon the combination of our regulatory, development and commercial capabilities and expertise and our ability to identify, select and acquire approved or clinically enabled medicine candidates for therapeutic indications that complement or augment our current medicines, or that otherwise fit into our development or strategic plans on terms that are acceptable to us. Identifying, selecting and acquiring promising medicines or medicine candidates requires substantial technical, financial and human resources expertise. Efforts to do so may not result in the actual acquisition or license of a particular medicine or medicine candidate, potentially resulting in a diversion of our management\u2019s time and the expenditure of our resources with no resulting benefit, which results may occur if we do not close our pending acquisition of Viela. If we are unable to identify, select and acquire suitable medicines or medicine candidates from third parties or acquire businesses at valuations and on other terms acceptable to us, or if we are unable to raise capital required to acquire businesses or new medicines, our business and prospects will be limited.\nMoreover, any medicine candidate we acquire may require additional, time-consuming development or regulatory efforts prior to commercial sale or prior to expansion into other indications, including pre-clinical studies if applicable, and extensive clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All medicine candidates are prone to the risk of failure that is inherent in pharmaceutical medicine development, including the possibility that the medicine candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and/or effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot assure that any such medicines that are approved will be manufactured or produced economically, successfully commercialized or widely accepted in the marketplace or be more effective or desired than other commercially available alternatives.\nIn addition, if we fail to successfully commercialize and further develop our medicines, there is a greater likelihood that we will fail to successfully develop a pipeline of other medicine candidates to follow our existing medicines or be able to acquire other medicines to expand our existing portfolio, and our business and prospects would be harmed.\nWe have experienced growth and expanded the size of our organization substantially in connection with our acquisition transactions, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth as well as potential additional growth in connection with future medicine, development program or company acquisitions.\nAs of December 31, 2013, we employed approximately 300 full-time employees as a consolidated entity. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 1,395 full-time employees, including approximately 460 sales representatives, representing a substantial change to the size of our organization. If our pending acquisition of Viela is completed, we will experience a further increase in headcount. We have also experienced, and may continue to experience, turnover of the sales representatives that we hired or will hire in connection with the commercialization of our medicines, requiring us to hire and train new sales representatives. Our management, personnel, systems and facilities currently in place may not be adequate to support anticipated growth, and we may not be able to retain or recruit qualified personnel in the future due to competition for personnel among pharmaceutical businesses.\nAs our commercialization plans and strategies continue to develop, including as a result of our pending acquisition of Viela, we will need to continue to recruit and train sales and marketing personnel. Our ability to manage any future growth effectively may require us to, among other things:\n\u2022\ncontinue to manage and expand the sales and marketing efforts for our existing medicines;\n\u2022\nenhance our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures;\n\u2022\nexpand our international resources;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully identify, recruit, hire, train, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees;\n\u2022\nestablish and increase our access to commercial supplies of our medicines and medicine candidates;\n\u2022\nexpand our facilities and equipment; and\n\u2022\nmanage our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors, collaborators, distributors and other third parties.\nOur acquisitions have resulted in many changes, and our pending acquisition of Viela may result in additional changes, including significant changes in the corporate business and legal entity structure, the integration of other companies and their personnel with us, and changes in systems. We may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving growth prospects from combining third-party businesses with our business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of operations and systems;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of employees and corporate cultures;\n\u2022\nchallenges in preparing financial statements and reporting timely results at both a statutory level for multiple entities and jurisdictions and at a consolidated level for public reporting;\n\u2022\nchallenges in keeping existing physician prescribers and patients and increasing adoption of acquired medicines;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities, adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the transaction; and\n\u2022\nchallenges in attracting and retaining key personnel.\nIf any of these factors impair our ability to continue to integrate our operations with those of any companies or businesses we acquire, including Viela if our pending acquisition is completed, we may not be able to realize the business opportunities, growth prospects and anticipated tax synergies from combining the businesses. In addition, we may be required to spend additional time or money on integration that otherwise would be spent on the development and expansion of our business. For example, we will need to spend additional time and money on the integration of Viela\u2019s research and development and sales and marketing functions with our own functions.\nWe may not be successful in growing our commercial operations outside the United States, and could encounter other challenges in growing our commercial presence, including due to risks associated with political and economic instability, operating under different legal requirements and tax complexities. If we are unable to manage our commercial growth outside of the United States, our opportunities to expand sales in other countries will be limited or we may experience greater costs with respect to our ex-U.S. commercial operations.\nWe have also broadened our acquisition strategy to include development-stage assets or programs, which entails additional risk to us. For example, if we are unable to identify programs that ultimately result in approved medicines, we may spend material amounts of our capital and other resources evaluating, acquiring and developing medicines that ultimately do not provide a return on our investment. We have less experience evaluating development-stage assets and may be at a disadvantage compared to other entities pursuing similar opportunities. Regardless, development-stage programs generally have a high rate of failure and we cannot guarantee that any such programs will ultimately be successful. While we have significantly enhanced our research and development function in recent years, we may need to enhance our clinical development and regulatory functions to properly evaluate and develop earlier-stage opportunities, which may include recruiting personnel that are knowledgeable in therapeutic areas we have not yet pursued. If we are unable to acquire promising development-stage assets or eventually obtain marketing approval for them, we may not be able to create a meaningful pipeline of new medicines and eventually realize a return on our investments. For example, a core strategic rationale for the Viela acquisition is Viela\u2019s pipeline of medicine candidates and research and development capabilities, but if we experience clinical failures with respect to Viela\u2019s medicine candidates and research programs or such candidates and programs do not otherwise result in marketed medicines, we will not realize the expected benefits from the substantial investment we intend to make in the acquisition and subsequent development of the Viela pipeline.\nOur management may also have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from day-to-day activities and toward managing these growth and integration activities. Our future financial performance and our ability to execute on our business plan will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth and our failure to effectively manage growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur prior medicine and company acquisitions and any other strategic transactions that we may pursue in the future could have a variety of negative consequences, and we may not realize the benefits of such transactions or attempts to engage in such transactions.\nWe have completed multiple medicine and company acquisitions and our strategy is to engage in additional strategic transactions with third parties, such as acquisitions of companies or divisions of companies and asset purchases of medicines, medicine candidates or technologies that we believe will complement or augment our existing business. We may also consider a variety of other business arrangements, including spin-offs, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and other investments. Any such transaction may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, pose significant integration challenges, create additional tax, legal, accounting and operational complexities in our business, require additional expertise, result in dilution to our existing shareholders and disrupt our management and business, which could harm our operations and financial results.\nWe are subject to contractual obligations under an amended and restated license agreement with the Regents of the University of California, San Diego, or UCSD, as amended, with respect to PROCYSBI. To the extent that we fail to perform our obligations under the agreement, UCSD may, with respect to applicable indications, terminate the license or otherwise cause the license to become non-exclusive. If this license was terminated, we would have no further right to use or exploit the related intellectual property, which would limit our ability to develop PROCYSBI in other indications, and could impact our ability to continue commercializing PROCYSBI in its approved indications.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic transaction opportunities and the negotiation process for any strategic transaction can be time-consuming and complex. In addition, we may not be successful in our efforts to engage in certain strategic transactions because our financial resources may be insufficient and/or third parties may not view our commercial and development capabilities as being adequate. We may not be able to expand our business or realize our strategic goals if we do not have sufficient funding or cannot borrow or raise additional capital. There is no assurance that following any of our recent acquisition transactions or any other strategic transaction, including the pending acquisition of Viela, we will achieve the anticipated revenues, net income or other benefits that we believe justify such transactions. In addition, any failures or delays in entering into strategic transactions anticipated by analysts or the investment community could seriously harm our consolidated business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.\nWe may not be able to successfully maintain our current advantageous tax status and resulting tax rates, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nOur parent company is incorporated in Ireland and has subsidiaries maintained in multiple jurisdictions, including Ireland, the United States, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Germany, Canada and Bermuda. We are able to achieve a favorable tax rate through the performance of certain functions and ownership of certain assets in tax-efficient jurisdictions, including Ireland and Bermuda, together with the use of intercompany service and transfer pricing agreements, each on an arm\u2019s length basis. Our effective tax rate may be different than experienced in the past due to numerous factors including, changes to the tax laws of jurisdictions that we operate in, the enactment of new tax treaties or changes to existing tax treaties, changes in the mix of our profitability from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the implementation of the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (see further discussion below), the implementation of the Bermuda Economic Substance Act 2018 (effective December 31, 2018) and our inability to secure or sustain acceptable agreements with tax authorities (if applicable). Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations. Taxing authorities, such as the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, actively audit and otherwise challenge these types of arrangements, and have done so in the pharmaceutical industry. We expect that these challenges will continue as a result of the recent increase in scrutiny and political attention on corporate tax structures. The IRS and/or the Irish tax authorities may challenge our structure and transfer pricing arrangements through an audit or lawsuit. Responding to or defending such a challenge could be expensive and consume time and other resources, and divert management\u2019s time and focus from operating our business. We cannot predict whether taxing authorities will conduct an audit or file a lawsuit challenging this structure, the cost involved in responding to any such audit or lawsuit, or the outcome. If we are unsuccessful in defending such a challenge, we may be required to pay taxes for prior periods, as well as interest, fines or penalties, and may be obligated to pay increased taxes in the future, any of which could require us to reduce our operating expenses, decrease efforts in support of our medicines or seek to raise additional funds, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe IRS may not agree with our conclusion that our parent company should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes following the combination of the businesses of Horizon Pharma, Inc., or HPI, our predecessor, and Vidara Therapeutics International Public Limited Company, or Vidara.\nAlthough our parent company is incorporated in Ireland, the IRS may assert that it should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. A corporation is generally considered a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Because our parent company is an Irish incorporated entity, it would generally be classified as a foreign corporation (and, therefore, a non-U.S. tax resident) under these general rules. Section 7874 of the Code provides an exception pursuant to which a foreign incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIn July 2018, the IRS issued regulations under Section 7874. We do not believe that our classification as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes is affected by Section 7874 or the regulations thereunder, though the IRS may disagree.\nRecent and future changes to U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws could materially adversely affect our company.\nUnder current law, we expect our parent company to be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, changes to the rules in Section 7874 of the Code or regulations promulgated thereunder or other guidance issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or the U.S. Treasury, or the IRS could adversely affect our parent company\u2019s status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes or the taxation of transactions between members of our group, and any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application. If our parent company is treated as a domestic corporation, more of our income will be taxed by the United States which may substantially increase our effective tax rate.\nIn addition, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or the OECD, released its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project final report on October 5, 2015. This report provides the basis for international standards for corporate taxation that are designed to prevent, among other things, the artificial shifting of income to tax havens and low-tax jurisdictions, the erosion of the tax base through interest deductions on intercompany debt and the artificial avoidance of permanent establishments (i.e., tax nexus with a jurisdiction). Legislation to adopt these standards has been enacted or is currently under consideration in a number of jurisdictions. On June 7, 2017, several countries, including many countries that we operate and have subsidiaries in, participated in the signing ceremony adopting the OECD\u2019s Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, commonly referred to as the MLI. The MLI came into effect on July 1, 2018. In January 2019, Ireland deposited the instrument of ratification of Ireland\u2019s MLI choices with the OECD. Ireland\u2019s MLI came into force on May 1, 2019, however the provisions in respect of withholding taxes and other taxes levied by Ireland did not come into effect for us until January 1, 2020 (with application also depending on whether the MLI has been ratified in other jurisdictions whose tax treaties with Ireland are affected). The MLI may modify affected tax treaties making it more difficult for us to obtain advantageous tax-treaty benefits. The number of affected tax treaties could eventually be in the thousands. As a result, our income may be taxed in jurisdictions where it is not currently taxed and at higher rates of tax than it is currently taxed, which may increase our effective tax rate.\nThe Irish Finance Act 2019, or Finance Act 2019, which was signed into law on December 22, 2019, introduced changes to Ireland\u2019s transfer pricing rules, which came into force with effect from January 1, 2020. The changes introduce the 2017 version of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, or 2017 OECD Guidelines, as the reference guidelines for Ireland\u2019s domestic transfer pricing regime. The 2017 OECD Guidelines were already applicable under Ireland\u2019s international tax treaties and therefore the introduction of these guidelines should only affect transactions with non-tax treaty countries. In addition to updating Irish tax law for the 2017 OECD Guidelines, these changes also extend the transfer pricing rules to certain non-trading transactions and to certain capital transactions. We have restructured certain intercompany arrangements, such that we do not expect there to be a material impact on our effective tax rate as a result of the introduction of these provisions.\nOn July 12, 2016, the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, or ATAD, was formally adopted by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council of the EU. The stated objective of the ATAD is to provide for the effective and swift coordinated implementation of anti-base erosion and profit shifting measures at EU level. Like all directives, the ATAD is binding as to the results it aims to achieve though EU Member States are free to choose the form and method of achieving those results. In addition, the ATAD contains a number of optional provisions that present an element of choice as to how it will be implemented into law. On December 25, 2018, the Finance Act 2018 was signed into Irish law, which introduced certain elements of the ATAD, such as the Controlled Foreign Company, or CFC, regime, into Irish law. The CFC regime became effective as of January 1, 2019. The ATAD also set out a high-level framework for the introduction of Anti-hybrid provisions. Finance Act 2019 introduced Anti-hybrid legislation in Ireland with effect from January 1, 2020. It is anticipated that Finance Act 2021 will introduce further ATAD measures, such as the interest limitation rules and anti-hybrid rules to neutralize reverse-hybrid mismatches into Irish law with effect from January 1, 2022. Although it is difficult at this stage to determine with precision the impact that these remaining provisions will have, their implementation could materially increase our effective tax rate.\nOn December 22, 2017, U.S. federal income tax legislation was signed into law (H.R. 1, \u201cAn Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018\u201d, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act) that significantly revised the Code in the United States. The Tax Act, among other things, contained significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), implementation of a \u201cbase erosion anti-abuse tax\u201d which requires U.S. corporations to make an alternative determination of taxable income without regard to tax deductions for certain payments to affiliates, taxation of certain non-U.S. corporations\u2019 earnings considered to be \u201cglobal intangible low taxed income\u201d, or GILTI, repeal of the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, for corporations and changes to a taxpayer\u2019s ability to either utilize or refund the AMT credits previously generated, changes to the limitation on deductions for certain executive compensation particularly with respect to the removal of the previously allowed performance based compensation exception, changes in the attribution rules relating to shareholders of certain \u201ccontrolled foreign corporations\u201d, limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one-time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. For example, U.S. federal income tax law resulting in additional taxes owed by U.S. shareholders under the GILTI rules, together with the Tax Act\u2019s change to the attribution rules related to \u201ccontrolled foreign corporations\u201d may discourage U.S. investors from owning or acquiring 10% or greater of our outstanding ordinary shares, which other shareholders may have viewed as beneficial or may otherwise negatively impact the trading price of our ordinary shares.\nOn March 27, 2020, H.R.748, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, was enacted in the United States, which provides temporary relief from certain aspects of the Tax Act that had imposed limitations on the utilization of certain losses, interest expense deductions, and the timing of refunds of alternative minimum tax credits.\nWe are unable to predict what tax laws may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business. To the extent new tax laws are enacted, or new guidance released, this could have an adverse effect on our future effective tax rate. It could also lead to an increase in the complexity and cost of tax compliance. We urge our shareholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our ordinary shares.\nIf a United States person is treated as owning at least 10% of our ordinary shares, such holder may be subject to adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences.\nIf a United States person is treated as owning (directly, indirectly, or constructively) at least 10% of the value or voting power of our ordinary shares, such person may be treated as a \u201cUnited States shareholder\u201d with respect to each \u201ccontrolled foreign corporation\u201d in our group (if any). Because our group includes one or more U.S. subsidiaries, certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries could be treated as controlled foreign corporations (regardless of whether or not we are treated as a controlled foreign corporation). A United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation may be required to report annually and include in its U.S. taxable income its pro rata share of \u201cSubpart F income,\u201d \u201cglobal intangible low-taxed income,\u201d and investments in U.S. property by controlled foreign corporations, regardless of whether we make any distributions. An individual that is a United States shareholder with respect to a controlled foreign corporation generally would not be allowed certain tax deductions or foreign tax credits that would be allowed to a U.S. corporation that is a United States shareholder with respect to a controlled foreign corporation. Failure to comply with these reporting and tax paying obligations may subject a United States shareholder to significant monetary penalties and may prevent the statute of limitations from starting with respect to such shareholder\u2019s U.S. federal income tax return for the year for which reporting was due. We cannot provide any assurances that we will assist investors in determining whether any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries is treated as a controlled foreign corporation or whether any investor is treated as a United States shareholder with respect to any such controlled foreign corporation or furnish to any United States shareholders information that may be necessary to comply with the aforementioned reporting and tax paying obligations. A United States investor should consult its advisors regarding the potential application of these rules to an investment in our ordinary shares.\nIf we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. We are highly dependent on our management, sales and marketing and scientific and medical personnel, including our executive officers. In order to retain valuable employees at our company, in addition to salary and annual cash incentives, we provide a mix of performance stock units, or PSUs, that vest subject to attainment of specified corporate performance goals and continued services, stock options and restricted stock units, or RSUs, that vest over time subject to continued services. The value to employees of PSUs, stock options and RSUs will be significantly affected by movements in our share price that are beyond our control, and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies.\nDespite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, sales and marketing, regulatory affairs, clinical development, medical affairs and development teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. Although we have written employment arrangements with all of our employees, these employment arrangements generally provide for at-will employment, which means that our employees can leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees and our inability to find suitable replacements could potentially harm our business, financial condition and prospects. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or the lives of any of our other employees. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled junior, mid-level, and senior managers as well as junior, mid-level, and senior sales and marketing and scientific and medical personnel.\nMany of the other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with whom we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and longer histories in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high quality candidates than that which we have to offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can develop and commercialize medicines and medicine candidates will be limited.\nWe are subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review by the FDA and equivalent foreign regulatory agencies, which may result in significant additional expense and significant penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our medicines.\nAny regulatory approvals that we obtain for our medicine candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the medicine may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the medicine candidate. In addition, with respect to our current FDA-approved medicines (and with respect to our medicine candidates, if approved), the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the medicine are subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMPs, GCPs, International Council for Harmonisation, or ICH, guidelines and GLPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all of our medicines in clinical development, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval.\nIn addition, the FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics. The FDA does not regulate the behaviour of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturers\u2019 promotional communications. A significant number of pharmaceutical companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations by various U.S. federal and state regulatory, investigative, prosecutorial and administrative entities in connection with the promotion of medicines for off-label uses and other sales practices. These investigations have alleged violations of various U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including claims asserting antitrust violations, violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, false claims laws, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, anti-kickback laws, and other alleged violations in connection with the promotion of medicines for unapproved uses, pricing and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement.\nLater discovery of previously unknown problems with a medicine, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the medicine, withdrawal of the medicine from the market, or voluntary or mandatory medicine recalls;\n\u2022\nrefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our strategic partners, or suspension or revocation of medicine license approvals;\n\u2022\nmedicine seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of medicines; and\n\u2022\ninjunctions, the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, or exclusion, debarment or suspension from government healthcare programs.\nIf we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not sustain profitability, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations and implementation or changes to such healthcare laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals that change the healthcare system in ways that could impact profitability. In the United States and abroad there is significant interest in implementing regulations and legislation with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality, and/or expanding access. The pharmaceutical industry has been a focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, particularly in the United States.\nThe healthcare system is highly regulated in the United States and, as a biotech company that participates in government-regulated healthcare programs, we are subject to complex laws and regulations. Violation of these laws, or any other federal or state regulations, may subject us to significant administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, damages, disgorgement, fines, exclusion, imprisonment, additional reporting requirements, and/or oversight from federal health care programs that could require the restructuring of our operations. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we ultimately are successful in our defense, will cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention away from the operation of our business.\nThere were efforts by the Trump administration as well as Congressional and judicial actions taken to replace or weaken certain aspects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the ACA). For example, President Trump signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to eliminate, delay or otherwise modify the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation that would repeal and/or replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA. In particular, the Tax Act included a provision which decreased, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA to $0. Commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate,\u201d this provision imposed a fine on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of the year. In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. Finally, Congress increased the manufacturer coverage gap discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drugs and biosimilars who participate in Medicare Part D from 50% to 70%.\nChallenges to the ACA are also taking place in courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, with some lower court\u2019s ruling some or all of the ACA unconstitutional. For example, on December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case, although it is unclear when a decision will be made. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. There is a wide range of potential outcomes to this litigation and it is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA\u2019s many different provisions affecting the health system, the pharmaceutical sector and our business.\nIn addition, drug pricing by pharmaceutical companies in the United States has come under increased scrutiny. Specifically, there have been several recent state and U.S. congressional inquiries into pricing practices by pharmaceutical companies.\nAt the federal level, the Trump Administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals and issuing executive orders and proposals in an effort to reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies, while calling on Congress to pass legislation that addresses drug prices and competition.\nAdditionally, in 2020, the Administration advanced its agenda on drug pricing through a series of executive orders. For example, on July 24, 2020, President Trump announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the Trump Administration proposals, including a policy that would tie both Medicare Part B and Part D drug prices to international drug prices, or the \u201cmost favored nation price,\u201d the details of which were released on September 13, 2020; one that directs HHS to finalize the Canadian drug importation proposed rule previously issued by HHS and makes other changes allowing for personal importation of drugs from Canada; one that directs HHS to finalize the rulemaking process on modifying the anti-kickback law safe harbors for plans, pharmacies, and PBMs, commonly known as the \u201crebate rule\u201d; and one that reduces the cost of insulin and injectable epinephrine to patients acquired through the 340B program. Further, on August 6, 2020, the Trump administration issued another executive order that instructs the federal government to develop a list of \u201cessential\u201d medicines and then buy them and other medical supplies from U.S. manufacturers instead of from companies around the world, including China. The order is meant to reduce regulatory barriers to domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing and catalyze manufacturing technologies needed to keep drug prices low and the production of drug products in the United States. The FDA issued the list of \u201cessential\u201d medicines pursuant to this order on October 30, 2020.\nIn November 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule, or IFR, implementing the Most Favored Nation, or MFN, Model basing Medicare Part B reimbursement rates for the top fifty drugs covered by Part B based to the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita. The MFN Model mandates participation for providers prescribing drugs included on the list and will apply in all U.S. states and territories for a seven-year period that was scheduled to begin on January 1, 2021 and end December 31, 2027. However, several lawsuits were filed challenging the rule. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. One court granted a preliminary injunction enjoining CMS from moving forward with the rule until CMS completed regular notice and comment rulemaking, delaying implementation. It is unclear if the Biden Administration will support, modify, or reverse the MFN model or implement other alternative measures. President Biden\u2019s presidential election campaign had indicated that Biden would direct Medicare to negotiate drug prices using international prices as a reference. The FDA released a final rule implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans. Several states have acted to implement importation plans or have introduced legislation to do so. FDA also finalized guidance for manufacturers to obtain an additional National Drug Code for an FDA-approved drug as part of a process to provide a manufacturer a means to import its drugs that were originally intended to be marketed in and authorized for sale in a foreign country. In addition, HHS and FDA are in the process of accepting industry proposals to facilitate personal importation of prescription drugs. On November 20, 2020, HHS also finalized the \u201crebate rule\u201d regulation by removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through PBMs, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between PBMs, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until March 22, 2021.\nCongress continued to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. For example, in June 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill, H.R. 1425, \u201cPatient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act\u201d, which would strengthen and expand parts of the ACA and incentivize Medicaid expansion, but also proposes to implement a \u201cFair Price Negotiation Program\u201d to utilize international price referencing metrics for certain drugs that are considered high-cost or are reimbursable by both Medicare Part D and Part B, while giving commercial payers, including employer and individual market plans, access to the reference price. The majority of our medicines are purchased by private payers, and much of the focus of pending legislation is on government program reimbursement.\nAdditionally, certain proposals have been contemplated that would implement a cap on annual price increases for certain drugs covered under Medicare at the rate of inflation or require the respective manufacturers to pay a rebate. There has also been advocacy for increasing the Medicaid drug rebates cap, currently at 100% of a drug's average manufacturer price or removing such cap in its entirety.\nIn addition to the federal government, many states have taken action in an effort to address rising health care costs. Generally, states have been more focused on introducing and enacting legislation that brings more transparency to drug pricing by requiring drug companies subject to these laws to notify insurers and government regulators of price increases and provide an explanation of the reasons for the increases, reducing the out-of-pocket cost of prescription drugs, and reviewing the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. However, in the 2020 budget, the California legislature directed the California Health and Human Services Agency to develop a process to use international reference pricing for Medicaid drugs. Certain states, including California, have enacted drug transparency laws requiring drug manufacturers to provide advance notice and explanation for price increases above a certain threshold. In addition, a growing number of states have implemented, or are contemplating implementing, drug affordability boards to establish \u201callowable rates\u201d for certain high-cost drugs identified by such boards.\nIn addition to the aforementioned price reform measures, there are other potential reform measures relating to the pharmaceutical industry. For example, there have been efforts to amend the Orphan Drug Act, including a bill passed in the House of Representatives in November 2020, the Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act, that would have limited manufacturers\u2019 ability to receive orphan drug exclusivity under the \u201ccost recovery\u201d pathway under the Orphan Drug Act. While the Senate did not take further action on this bill in 2020, the bill\u2019s co-sponsors were re-elected, and it remains unclear whether it will be re-introduced. Further, on December 31, 2020, CMS issued a final rule that broadened the definition of \u201cline extension\u201d under the ACA. It is unclear whether this final rule will be challenged similar to other final rules that were issued shortly prior to the change in presidential administration.\nIn countries in the EU, legislators, policymakers, and healthcare insurance funds continue to propose and implement cost-containing measures to keep healthcare costs down, due in part to the attention being paid to healthcare cost containment in the EU. Certain of these changes could impose limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our products and any approved product candidates or the amounts of reimbursement available for these products from governmental agencies or third-party payers, may increase the tax obligations on pharmaceutical companies such as ours, or may facilitate the introduction of generic competition with respect to our products.\nThe implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our current medicines and/or those for which we may receive regulatory approval in the future.\nWe are subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse, transparency laws and false claims laws. Prosecutions under such laws have increased in recent years and we may become subject to such litigation. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nIn the United States, we are subject directly, or indirectly through our customers and other third parties, to various state and federal fraud and abuse and transparency laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, civil monetary penalty statutes prohibiting, among other things, beneficiary inducements, and similar state and local laws, federal and state privacy and security laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, sunshine laws, government price reporting laws, and other fraud laws. Some states, such as Massachusetts, make certain reported information public. In addition, there are state and local laws that require pharmaceutical representatives to be licensed and comply with codes of conduct, transparency reporting, and other obligations. Collectively, these laws may affect, among other things, our current and proposed research, sales, marketing and educational programs, as well as other possible relationships with customers, pharmacies, physicians, payers, and patients. We are subject to similar laws in the EU/EEA, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679), or GDPR, under which fines of up to \u20ac20.0 million or up to 4% of the annual global turnover of the infringer, whichever is greater, could be imposed for significant non-compliance.\nCompliance with these laws, including the development of a comprehensive compliance program, is difficult, costly and time consuming. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Moreover, state governmental agencies may propose or enact laws and regulations that extend or contradict federal requirements. These risks may be increased where there are evolving interpretations of applicable regulatory requirements, such as those applicable to manufacturer co-pay programs. Pharmaceutical manufacturer co-pay programs, including pharmaceutical manufacturer donations to patient assistance programs offered by charitable foundations, are the subject of ongoing litigation, enforcement actions and settlements (involving other manufacturers and to which we are not a party) and evolving interpretations of applicable regulatory requirements and certain state laws, and any change in the regulatory or enforcement environment regarding such programs could impact our ability to offer such programs. Other recent legislation and regulatory policies contain provisions that disincentivizes the use of co-pay coupons by requiring their value to be included in average sales price or best price calculations, potentially lowering reimbursement for drugs with a high use of copay coupons in Medicare Part B and Medicaid. If we are unsuccessful with our co-pay programs, we would be at a competitive disadvantage in terms of pricing versus preferred branded and generic competitors, or be subject to significant penalties. We are engaged in various business arrangements with current and potential customers, and we can give no assurance that such arrangements would not be subject to scrutiny under such laws, despite our efforts to properly structure such arrangements. Even if we structure our programs with the intent of compliance with such laws, there can be no certainty that we would not need to defend our business activities against enforcement or litigation. Further, we cannot give any assurances that prior business activities or arrangements of other companies that we acquire will not be scrutinized or subject to enforcement or litigation. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have an impact on our business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative sanctions, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, imprisonment, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nThere has also been a trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The ACA, among other things, imposed reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians, defined to include dentists, podiatrists, optometrists and licensed chiropractors, and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding payments and transfers of value provided during the previous year to include physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives. Failure to submit required information may result in significant civil monetary penalties.\nOn March 5, 2019, we received a civil investigative demand, or CID, from the DOJ pursuant to the Federal False Claims Act regarding assertions that certain of our payments to PBMs were potentially in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. The CID requests certain documents and information related to our payments to PBMs, pricing and our patient assistance program regarding DUEXIS, VIMOVO and PENNSAID 2%. We are cooperating with the investigation. While we believe that our payments and programs are compliant with the Anti-Kickback Statute, no assurance can be given as to the timing or outcome of the DOJ\u2019s investigation, or that it will not result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are unable to predict whether we could be subject to other actions under any of these or other healthcare laws, or the impact of such actions. If we are found to be in violation of, or to have encouraged or assisted the violation by third parties of any of the laws described above or other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, including significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, withdrawal of regulatory approval, imprisonment, exclusion from government healthcare reimbursement programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions and other associated remedies, or private \u201cqui tam\u201d actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nOur medicines or any other medicine candidate that we develop may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent regulatory approval or commercialization, result in medicine re-labeling or withdrawal from the market or have a significant impact on customer demand.\nUndesirable side effects caused by any medicine candidate that we develop could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications, or cause us to evaluate the future of our development programs. In our Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating TEPEZZA for the treatment of active TED, the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events were muscle spasms, nausea, alopecia, diarrhea, fatigue, hyperglycemia, hearing impairment, dysgeusia, headache and dry skin. With respect to KRYSTEXXA, the most commonly reported serious adverse reactions in the pivotal trial were gout flares, infusion reactions, nausea, contusion or ecchymosis, nasopharyngitis, constipation, chest pain, anaphylaxis, exacerbation of pre-existing congestive heart failure and vomiting. With respect to RAVICTI, the most common side effects are diarrhea, nausea, decreased appetite, gas, vomiting, high blood levels of ammonia, headache, tiredness and dizziness. The most common adverse events reported in a Phase 2 clinical trial of PENNSAID 2% were application site reactions, such as dryness, exfoliation, erythema, pruritus, pain, induration, rash and scabbing. With respect to PROCYSBI, the most common side effects include vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, breath odor, diarrhea, skin odor, fatigue, rash and headache. In our two Phase 3 clinical trials with DUEXIS, the most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events were nausea, dyspepsia, diarrhea, constipation and upper respiratory tract infection. The most common side effects observed in pivotal trials for ACTIMMUNE were \u201cflu-like\u201d or constitutional symptoms such as fever, headache, chills, myalgia and fatigue. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events in the Phase 3 clinical trials with RAYOS included flare in rheumatoid arthritis related symptoms, abdominal pain, nasopharyngitis, headache, flushing, upper respiratory tract infection, back pain and weight gain.\nThe FDA or other regulatory authorities may also require, or we may undertake, additional clinical trials to support the safety profile of our medicines or medicine candidates.\nIn addition, if we or others identify undesirable side effects caused by our medicines or any other medicine candidate that we may develop that receives marketing approval, or if there is a perception that the medicine is associated with undesirable side effects:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the medicine or place restrictions on the way it is prescribed;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way the medicine is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the medicine or implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy; and\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to increased exposure to product liability and/or personal injury claims.\nIf any of these events occurred with respect to our medicines, our ability to generate significant revenues from the sale of these medicines would be significantly harmed.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our pre-clinical and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines or if they experience regulatory compliance issues, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our medicine candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe have agreements with third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, to conduct our clinical programs, including those required for post-marketing commitments, and we expect to continue to rely on CROs for the completion of on-going and planned clinical trials. We may also have the need to enter into other such agreements in the future if we were to develop other medicine candidates or conduct clinical trials in additional indications for our existing medicines. We also rely heavily on these parties for the execution of our clinical studies and control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol. We, our CROs and our academic research organizations are required to comply with current GCP or ICH regulations. The FDA, and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, enforce these GCP or ICH regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or our CROs or collaborators fail to comply with applicable GCP or ICH regulations, the data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and our submission of marketing applications may be delayed or the FDA, or such other regulatory authorities, may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure that, upon inspection, the FDA, or such other regulatory authorities, will determine that any of our clinical trials comply or complied with GCP or ICH regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with medicine produced under cGMP regulations, and may require a large number of test subjects. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of our CROs or collaborators violates federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or privacy and security laws. We must also obtain certain third-party institutional review board, or IRB, and ethics committee approvals in order to conduct our clinical trials. Delays by IRBs and ethics committees in providing such approvals may delay our clinical trials.\nIf any of our relationships with these third-party CROs or collaborators terminate, we may not be able to enter into similar arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If CROs or collaborators do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our medicines and medicine candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our medicines and medicine candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nSwitching or adding additional CROs or collaborators can involve substantial cost and require extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO or collaborator commences work. As a result, delays may occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs and collaborators, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or prospects. In particular, the ability of our CROs to conduct certain of their operations, including monitoring of clinical sites, has been limited by the COVID-19 pandemic, and to the extent that our CROs are unable to fulfil their contractual obligations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or government orders in response to the pandemic, we may have limited or no recourse under the terms of our contractual agreements with our CROs.\nClinical development of drugs and biologics involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials of potential medicine candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Medicine candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through pre-clinical studies and initial clinical testing. For example, in December 2016, we announced that the Phase 3 trial, Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of ACTIMMUNE Dose Escalation in Friedreich\u2019s ataxia, evaluating ACTIMMUNE for the treatment of Friedreich\u2019s ataxia did not meet its primary endpoint. Additionally, we discontinued our ACTIMMUNE investigator-initiated trials in oncology to focus on our strategic pipeline where we see more promise and long-term intellectual property protection.\nWe may experience delays in clinical trials or investigator-initiated studies. We do not know whether any additional clinical trials will be initiated in the future, begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u2022\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022\nobtaining IRB or ethics committee approval at each site;\n\u2022\nrecruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022\nhaving patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nclinical sites dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022\nadding new sites; or\n\u2022\nmanufacturing sufficient quantities of medicine candidates for use in clinical trials.\nOur clinical trials may also be affected by COVID-19. For example, two of our clinical trials for TEPEZZA have been delayed until later in 2021 due to the impact of the TEPEZZA supply disruption at Catalent. In addition, clinical site initiation and patient enrollment may be delayed due to prioritization of hospital and healthcare resources toward COVID-19. Current or potential patients in our ongoing or planned clinical trials may also choose to not enroll, not participate in follow-up clinical visits or drop out of the trial as a precaution against contracting COVID-19. Further, some patients may not be able or willing to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Some clinical sites in the United States have slowed or stopped further enrollment of new patients in clinical trials, denied access to site monitors or otherwise curtailed certain operations. Similarly, our ability to recruit and retain principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19, may be adversely impacted. These events could delay our clinical trials, increase the cost of completing our clinical trials and negatively impact the integrity, reliability or robustness of the data from our clinical trials.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the medicine candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs or biologics that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. In addition, if patients drop out of our trials, miss scheduled doses or follow-up visits or otherwise fail to follow trial protocols, or if our trials are otherwise disputed due to COVID-19 or actions taken to slow its spread, the integrity of data from our trials may be compromised or not accepted by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which would represent a significant setback for the applicable program.\nWe could encounter delays if prescribing physicians encounter unresolved ethical issues associated with enrolling patients in clinical trials of our medicine candidates in lieu of prescribing existing treatments that have established safety and efficacy profiles. Further, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, our collaborators, the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a medicine candidate, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. If we experience delays in the completion of, or if we terminate, any clinical trial of our medicine candidates, the commercial prospects of our medicine candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate medicine revenues from any of these medicine candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our medicine development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence medicine sales and generate revenues.\nMoreover, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA. The FDA may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation of the study. The FDA may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of one or more of our medicine candidates.\nAny of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our medicine candidates.\nBusiness interruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics or health pandemics, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions. While we carry insurance for certain of these events and have implemented disaster management plans and contingencies, the occurrence of any of these business interruptions could seriously harm our business and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. We conduct significant management operations at both our global headquarters located in Dublin, Ireland and our U.S. office located in Deerfield, Illinois. If our Dublin or Deerfield offices were affected by a natural or man-made disaster or other business interruption, our ability to manage our domestic and foreign operations could be impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We currently rely, and intend to rely in the future, on third-party manufacturers and suppliers to produce our medicines and third-party logistics partners to ship our medicines. Our ability to obtain commercial supplies of our medicines could be disrupted and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if the operations of these third-party suppliers or logistics partners were affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption. The ultimate impact of such events on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure is unknown.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data, which exposes us to data security risks.\nWe generate and store sensitive data, including research data, intellectual property, personal data, and proprietary business information owned or controlled by ourselves or our employees, partners and other parties. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing a combination of our own on-site systems and third-party information technology systems, including cloud-based data centers. We are dependent upon such systems, infrastructure and data, including mobile technologies, to operate our business. The multitude and complexity of our computer systems may make them vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, disruption of data integrity, inadvertent errors that expose our data or systems, malicious intrusion, or random attacks. Likewise, data privacy or security incidents or breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including our intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information of our employees, patients, customers or other business partners may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyber incidents are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity.\nCyber incidents could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Changes in how our employees work and access our systems during the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to additional opportunities for bad actors to launch cyberattacks or for employees to cause inadvertent security risks or incidents. Our business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. A security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure or modification of or prevents access to patient information, including personally identifiable information or protected health information, could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to litigation or other liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data, any of which could disrupt our business and/or result in increased costs or loss of revenue. The effects of a security breach or privacy violation could be further amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property.\nDespite significant efforts to create security barriers to the above described threats, it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate these risks. We may be unable to anticipate or prevent techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to compromise our systems because they change frequently and are generally not detected until after an incident has occurred. In addition, an accidental or intentional cybersecurity event could result in significant increases in costs, including costs for remediating the effects of such an event, fines imposed by regulators, lost revenues due to decrease in customer trust and network downtime, increases in insurance premiums due to cybersecurity incidents and damages to our reputation because of any such incident. While we have invested, and continue to invest, in the protection of our data and information technology infrastructure, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions, or identify vulnerabilities or breaches in our systems, that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us. In addition, we cannot be certain that (a) our liability insurance will be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches; (b) such coverage will cover any indemnification claims against us relating to any incident, will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all; or (c) any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations related to data privacy, and our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing data privacy and the protection of personal information. These laws and regulations govern our processing of personal data, including the collection, access, use, analysis, modification, storage, transfer, security breach notification, destruction and disposal of personal data. There are foreign and state law versions of these laws and regulations to which we are currently and/or may in the future, be subject. For example, the collection and use of personal health data in the EU is governed by the GDPR. The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information disclosed to the individuals about our privacy practices, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the United States, provides an enforcement authority and imposes potentially large monetary penalties for noncompliance. The GDPR requirements apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information within our company, including employee information. The GDPR and similar data privacy laws of other jurisdictions place significant responsibilities on us and create potential liability in relation to personal data that we or our third-party service providers process, including in clinical trials conducted in the United States and EU. In addition, we expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards relating to privacy and data protection in the United States, the EU and other jurisdictions, and we cannot determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business.\nThe UK\u2019s vote in favor of exiting the EU, often referred to as Brexit, and ongoing developments in the UK have created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the UK. As of January 1, 2021, and the expiry of transitional arrangements agreed to between the UK and EU, data processing in the UK is governed by a UK version of the GDPR (combining the GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018), exposing us to two parallel regimes, each of which potentially authorizes similar fines and other potentially divergent enforcement actions for certain violations. Pursuant to the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or TCA, which went into effect on January 1, 2021, the UK and EU agreed to a specified period during which the UK will be treated like an EU member state in relation to transfers of personal data to the UK for four months from January 1, 2021. This period may be extended by two further months. Unless the EC makes an \u2018adequacy finding\u2019 in respect of the UK before the expiration of such specified period, the UK will become an \u2018inadequate third country\u2019 under the GDPR and transfers of data from the EEA to the UK will require an \u2018transfer mechanism,\u2019 such as the standard contractual clauses. Furthermore, following the expiration of the specified period, there will be increasing scope for divergence in application, interpretation and enforcement of the data protection law as between the UK and EEA. As a result, we may incur liabilities, expenses, costs, and other operational losses under GDPR and applicable EU Member States and the UK privacy laws in connection with any measures we take to comply with them.\nRecent legal developments in Europe have created further complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the EU and UK to the United States. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU, invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, or Privacy Shield, under which personal data could be transferred from the EU and UK to United States entities who had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. Nine of our United States entities have self-certified under the scheme to facilitate the transfer of personal data from the EU and UK to the United States. The UK\u2019s supervisory authority may similarly invalidate use of the Privacy Shield as a vehicle for lawful data transfers from the UK to the United States. As such, our transfers of personal data to the United States may not comply with European data protection law and may increase our exposure to the GDPR\u2019s heightened sanctions for violations of its cross-border data transfer restrictions, including fines of up to 4% of annual global revenue and injunctions against transfers. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the EC as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, and potential alternative to the Privacy Shield), it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. Use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country, in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals and additional measures and/or contractual provisions may need to be put in place, however, the nature of these additional measures is currently uncertain. As supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances where the standard contractual clauses cannot be used, and/or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results.\nAdditionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA has been dubbed the first \u201cGDPR-like\u201d law in the United States since it creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the CCPA), provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new private right of action for data breaches. It remains unclear how the CCPA will be interpreted, but as currently written, it will likely impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information. Further, California voters approved a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, in the November 3, 2020 election. Effective starting on January 1, 2023, the CPRA will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding consumers\u2019 rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. New legislation proposed or enacted in various other states will continue to shape the data privacy environment nationally. Certain state laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to confidential, sensitive and personal information than federal, international or other state laws, and such laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. As we expand our operations and trials (both preclinical or clinical), the CCPA and CPRA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA and CPRA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. Other states are beginning to pass similar laws.\nCompliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. Any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with any applicable federal, state or similar foreign laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security could result in damage to our reputation, as well as proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies or other third parties, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions, which would subject us to significant fines, sanctions, awards, penalties or judgments, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Furthermore, the laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is costly.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our medicines.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability claims as a result of the commercial sales of our medicines and the clinical testing of our medicine candidates. For example, we may be sued if any of our medicines or medicine candidates allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the medicine, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our medicines and medicine candidates. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our medicines or medicine candidates that we may develop;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\na diversion of management\u2019s time and resources;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nmedicine recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nexhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our medicines or medicine candidates.\nOur inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of medicines we develop. We currently carry product liability insurance covering our clinical studies and commercial medicine sales in the amount of $125.0 million in the aggregate. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. If we determine that it is prudent to increase our product liability coverage due to the on-going commercialization of our current medicines in the United States, and/or the potential commercial launches of any of our medicines in additional markets or for additional indications, we may be unable to obtain such increased coverage on acceptable terms or at all. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We will have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials, and we and our third-party manufacturers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur third-party manufacturers\u2019 activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials owned by us, including the components of our medicine candidates and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturers are subject to federal, state and local as well as foreign laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. Although we believe that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of an accident, state, federal or foreign authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations. We currently only maintain hazardous materials insurance coverage related to our South San Francisco facility. If we are subject to any liability as a result of our third-party manufacturers\u2019 activities involving hazardous materials, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected. In the future we may seek to establish longer-term third-party manufacturing arrangements, pursuant to which we would seek to obtain contractual indemnification protection from such third-party manufacturers potentially limiting this liability exposure.\nRisks Related to our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant operating losses.\nWe have financed our operations primarily through equity and debt financings and have incurred significant operating losses in prior years. We recorded operating income of $490.0 million, $126.6 million and $37.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We recorded net income of $389.8 million and $573.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and a net loss of $38.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $215.9 million. Our prior losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in our development activities for our medicines and medicine candidates, commercialization activities related to our medicines and costs associated with our acquisition transactions. Our prior losses, combined with possible future losses, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our shareholders\u2019 equity and working capital. While we anticipate that we will continue to generate operating profits in the future, whether we can accomplish this will depend on the revenues we generate from the sale of our medicines being sufficient to cover our operating expenses. If the Viela acquisition is completed, we also expect our operating expenses to increase substantially as a result of continuing to develop Viela\u2019s pipeline of medicine candidates, which will negatively impact our future profitability until such time that these potential medicine candidates are approved and successfully commercialized.\nWe have limited sources of revenues and significant expenses. We cannot be certain that we will sustain profitability, which would depress the market price of our ordinary shares and could cause our investors to lose all or a part of their investment.\nOur ability to sustain profitability depends upon our ability to generate sales of our medicines. The commercialization of our medicines has been primarily in the United States. We may never be able to successfully commercialize our medicines or develop or commercialize other medicines in the United States, which we believe represents our most significant commercial opportunity. Our ability to generate future revenues depends heavily on our success in:\n\u2022\ncontinued commercialization of our existing medicines and any other medicine candidates for which we obtain approval;\n\u2022\nsecuring additional foreign regulatory approvals for our medicines in territories where we have commercial rights; and\n\u2022\ndeveloping, acquiring and commercializing a portfolio of other medicines or medicine candidates in addition to our current medicines.\nEven if we do generate additional medicine sales, we may not be able to sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the market price of our ordinary shares and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, diversify our medicine offerings or continue our operations.\nWe may need to obtain additional financing to fund additional acquisitions.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to:\n\u2022\ncommercialize our existing medicines in the United States, including the substantial expansion of our sales force in recent years;\n\u2022\ncomplete the regulatory approval process, and any future required clinical development related thereto, for our medicines and medicine candidates;\n\u2022\npotentially acquire other businesses or additional complementary medicines or medicines that augment our current medicine portfolio, including costs associated with refinancing debt of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nsatisfy progress and milestone payments under our existing and future license, collaboration and acquisition agreements; and\n\u2022\nconduct clinical trials with respect to potential additional indications, as well as conduct post-marketing requirements and commitments, with respect to our medicines and medicines we acquire.\nWhile we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, along with future cash flows based on our current expectations of continued revenue growth, will be sufficient to fund our operations, we may need to raise additional funds if we choose to expand our commercialization or development efforts more rapidly than presently anticipated, if we develop or acquire additional medicines or acquire companies, or if our revenue does not meet expectations.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to slow its spread, the global credit and financial markets have at times experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any additional debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly and more dilutive. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our medicines or medicine candidates or one or more of our other research and development initiatives, or delay, cut back or abandon our plans to grow the business through acquisitions. We also could be required to:\n\u2022\nseek collaborators for one or more of our current or future medicine candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; or\n\u2022\nrelinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or medicine candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nIn addition, if we are unable to secure financing to support future acquisitions, including our pending acquisition of Viela, our ability to execute on a key aspect of our overall growth strategy would be impaired. In connection with our pending acquisition of Viela, we entered into an amended and restated commitment letter, or Commitment Letter, with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., or together the Commitment Parties, pursuant to which the Commitment Parties have provided commitments, subject to certain conditions, to provide $1,300 million of senior secured term loans, the proceeds of which, in addition to a portion of our existing cash on hand, will be used to pay the consideration for the Viela acquisition. If we are unable to satisfy the required conditions and to secure the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter, our ability to complete the Viela acquisition and our overall growth strategy would be impaired.\nAny of the above events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe have incurred a substantial amount of debt, which could adversely affect our business, including by restricting our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness, and prevent us from meeting our debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $1,003.4 million book value, or $1,018.0 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, including $418.0 million in secured indebtedness. In connection with our pending acquisition of Viela, we have entered into the Commitment Letter, pursuant to which the Commitment Parties have provided commitments to provide an additional $1,300 million of senior secured term loans.\nThis substantial level of debt could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nreducing the benefits we expect to receive from our prior and any future acquisition transactions;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates to the extent of any future borrowings, including borrowings under our credit agreement, at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including our outstanding notes, our credit agreement, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, changes in our business or general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes and increasing the cost of any such financing;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent they are not as highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage may prevent us from exploiting; and\n\u2022\nrestricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities.\nOur credit agreement and the indenture governing our 5.5% Senior Notes due 2027, or 2027 Senior Notes, impose, and the terms of any future indebtedness may impose, various covenants that limit our ability and/or the ability of our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 (as designated under such agreements) to, among other things, pay dividends or distributions, repurchase equity, prepay junior debt and make certain investments, incur additional debt and issue certain preferred stock, incur liens on assets, engage in certain asset sales, consolidate with or merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries, and allow to exist certain restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us.\nOur ability to obtain future financing and engage in other transactions may be restricted by these covenants. In addition, any credit ratings will impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and our cost of capital. Our ratings at any time will reflect each rating organization\u2019s then opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. There can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future. A reduction in our credit ratings may limit our ability to borrow at acceptable interest rates. If our credit ratings were downgraded or put on watch for a potential downgrade, we may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in the amounts, at the times or interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might otherwise be available. Any impairment of our ability to obtain future financing on favorable terms could have an adverse effect on our ability to refinance any of our then-existing debt and may severely restrict our ability to execute on our business strategy, which includes the continued acquisition of additional medicines or businesses.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to slow its spread, the global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any additional debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly or more dilutive.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments under or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic, industry and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. For example, we expect that the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to slow its spread will continue to have a negative impact on net sales of our medicines, which will in turn negatively impact our cash flows. Our ability to generate cash flow to meet our payment obligations under our debt may also depend on the successful implementation of our operating and growth strategies. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. We cannot assure that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or business operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot ensure that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would be successful and permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of existing or future debt agreements, including the indenture that governs the 2027 Senior Notes and our credit agreement. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result:\n\u2022\nour debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable;\n\u2022\nthe administrative agent and/or the lenders under our credit agreement could foreclose against the assets securing the borrowings then outstanding; and\n\u2022\nwe could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in you losing your investment.\nWe generally have broad discretion in the use of our cash and may not use it effectively.\nOur management has broad discretion in the application of our cash, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the use of our cash. Our management may not apply our cash in ways that ultimately increase the value of any investment in our securities. We expect to use our existing cash to fund commercialization activities for our medicines, to potentially fund additional medicine, medicine candidate or business acquisitions, to potentially fund additional regulatory approvals of certain of our medicines, to potentially fund development, life cycle management or manufacturing activities of our medicines and medicine candidates, to potentially fund share repurchases, and for working capital, milestone payments, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. We may also invest our cash in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. These investments may not yield a favorable return to our shareholders. If we do not invest or apply our cash in ways that enhance shareholder value, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause the price of our ordinary shares to decline.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset U.S. income taxes may be limited.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50 percent change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset post-change income may be limited. For example, we continue to carry forward our annual limitation resulting from an ownership change date of August 2, 2012. The limitation on pre-change net operating losses incurred prior to the August 2, 2012 change date is approximately $7.7 million for 2021 through 2028. The net operating loss carryforward and tax credit carryforward limitations are cumulative such that any use of the carryforwards below the limitations in one year will result in a corresponding increase in the limitations for the subsequent tax year. Under the Tax Act, as modified by the CARES Act, U.S. federal net operating losses incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of federal net operating losses generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, to the extent such net operating losses are carried forward into taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, is limited to 80 percent of the then current year\u2019s taxable income. Under the CARES Act, U.S. federal net operating losses arising in a tax year beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2021, can be carried back five years. It remains uncertain if and to what extent various U.S. states will conform to the Tax Act and the CARES Act.\nFollowing certain acquisitions of a U.S. corporation by a foreign corporation, Section 7874 of the Code limits the ability of the acquired U.S. corporation and its U.S. affiliates to utilize U.S. tax attributes such as net operating losses to offset U.S. taxable income resulting from certain transactions. Based on the limited guidance available, we expect this limitation is applicable for approximately ten years following our merger transaction with Vidara with respect to certain intercompany transactions. As a result, we or our other U.S. affiliates may not be able to utilize U.S. tax attributes to offset U.S. taxable income or U.S. tax liability respectively, if any, resulting from certain intercompany taxable transactions during such period. Notwithstanding this limitation, we expect that we will be able to fully use our U.S. net operating losses and tax credits prior to their expiration. As a result of this limitation, however, it may take Horizon Therapeutics USA, Inc. (formerly known as Horizon Pharma USA, Inc. and as the successor to HPI) longer to use its net operating losses and tax credits. Moreover, contrary to these expectations, it is possible that the limitation under Section 7874 of the Code on the utilization of U.S. tax attributes could prevent us from fully utilizing our U.S. tax attributes prior to their expiration if we do not generate sufficient taxable income or tax obligations.\nAny limitation on our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, including the carryforwards of companies that we acquire, will likely increase the taxes we would otherwise pay in future years if we were not subject to such limitations.\nUnstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and share price.\nFrom time to time, including recently as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to slow its spread, global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturn, volatile business environment and continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to complete, more costly, and more dilutive. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and share price and could require us to delay or abandon commercialization or development plans. There is a risk that one or more of our current service providers, manufacturers and other partners may not survive an economic down-turn, which could directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $2,079.9 million of cash and cash equivalents consisting of cash and money market funds. While we are not aware of any downgrades, material losses, or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents since December 31, 2020, no assurance can be given that deterioration in conditions of the global credit and financial markets would not negatively impact our current portfolio of cash equivalents or our ability to meet our financing objectives. Dislocations in the credit market may adversely impact the value and/or liquidity of marketable securities owned by us.\nThe UK\u2019s referendum to leave the EU and the UK\u2019s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d has caused and may continue to cause disruptions to capital and currency markets worldwide. The full impact of Brexit, however, remains uncertain. Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed to between the UK and the EU, the UK was subject to a transition period, or Transition Period, until December 31, 2020, during which EU rules continued to apply. The TCA, which outlines the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU was agreed in December 2020 and has been approved by each EU member state and the UK. The TCA is due to be voted upon by the European Parliament in the near future, but has provisionally applied since January 1, 2021.\nThere remains uncertainty as to the practical impacts of Brexit and, especially in the early stages of the UK and the EU operating under different legislation, our results of operations and access to capital may be negatively affected by interest rate, exchange rate and other market and economic volatility, as well as political uncertainty. Brexit may also have a detrimental effect on our customers, distributors and suppliers, which would, in turn, adversely affect our revenues and financial condition.\nWhile the TCA provides for the tariff-free trade of medicinal products between the UK and the EU there may be additional non-tariff costs to such trade which did not exist prior to the end of the Transition Period. Further, should the UK diverge from the EU from a regulatory perspective in relation to medicinal products, tariffs could be put into place in the future. Any further changes in international trade, tariff and import/export regulations as a result of Brexit or otherwise may impose unexpected duty costs or other non-tariff barriers on us.\nWe could therefore, both now and in the future, face additional expenses (when compared to the position prior to the end of the Transition Period) to operate our business, which could harm or delay our business. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between the impacted nations and the UK.\nIf the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, is discontinued, interest payments under our credit agreement may be calculated using another reference rate.\nIn July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA, which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA intends to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. Although there have been certain issuances utilizing SOFR, it is unknown whether this or any other alternative reference rate will attain market acceptance as a replacement for LIBOR. LIBOR is used as a benchmark rate throughout our credit agreement, and our credit agreement does not address all circumstances in which LIBOR ceases to be published. There remains uncertainty regarding the future utilization of LIBOR and the nature of any replacement rate, and any potential effects of the transition away from LIBOR on us are not known. The transition process may involve, among other things, increased volatility and illiquidity in markets for instruments that currently rely on LIBOR and may result in increased borrowing costs, the effectiveness of related transactions such as hedges, uncertainty under applicable documentation, including the credit agreement, or difficult and costly processes to amend such documentation. As a result, our ability to refinance our credit agreement or other indebtedness or to hedge our exposure to floating rate instruments may be impaired, which would adversely affect the operations of our business.\nChanges in accounting rules or policies may affect our financial position and results of operations.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, and related implementation guidelines and interpretations can be highly complex and involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation, the adoption of new guidance or the application of existing guidance to changes in our business could significantly affect our financial position and results of operations. In addition, our operation as an Irish company with multiple subsidiaries in different jurisdictions adds additional complexity to the application of GAAP and this complexity will be exacerbated further if we complete additional strategic transactions. Changes in the application of existing rules or guidance applicable to us or our wholly owned subsidiaries could significantly affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nCovenants under the indenture governing our 2027 Senior Notes and our credit agreement may restrict our business and operations in many ways, and if we do not effectively manage our covenants, our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe indenture governing the 2027 Senior Notes and the credit agreement impose various covenants that limit our ability and/or our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions, repurchase equity, prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt and make certain investments;\n\u2022\nincur additional debt and issue certain preferred stock;\n\u2022\nprovide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u2022\nincur liens on assets;\n\u2022\nengage in certain asset sales;\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate with or sell all or substantially all of our assets to another person;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ndesignate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nallow to exist certain restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us.\nThese covenants may:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the limitations and decreased flexibility on our business due to our significant debt obligations, we may not be able to capitalize on strategic opportunities or grow our business to the extent we would be able to without these limitations.\nOur failure to comply with any of the covenants could result in a default under the credit agreement or the indenture governing the 2027 Senior Notes, which could permit the administrative agent or the trustee, as applicable, or permit the lenders or the holders of the 2027 Senior Notes to cause the administrative agent or the trustee, as applicable, to declare all or part of any outstanding senior secured term loans or revolving loans, or the 2027 Senior Notes to be immediately due and payable or to exercise any remedies provided to the administrative agent or the trustee, including, in the case of the credit agreement proceeding against the collateral granted to secure our obligations under the credit agreement. An event of default under the credit agreement or the indenture governing the 2027 Senior Notes could also lead to an event of default under the terms of the other agreement. Any such event of default or any exercise of rights and remedies by our creditors could seriously harm our business.\nIf intangible assets that we have recorded in connection with our acquisition transactions become impaired, we could have to take significant charges against earnings.\nIn connection with the accounting for our various acquisition transactions, we have recorded significant amounts of intangible assets. Under GAAP, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of goodwill has been impaired. Amortizing intangible assets will be assessed for impairment in the event of an impairment indicator. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an impairment of $33.6 million to fully write off the book value of developed technology related to PROCYSBI in Canada and Latin America. Such impairment and any reduction or other impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and shareholders\u2019 equity in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to our medicines and medicine candidates, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our medicines and medicine candidates. The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. The patent applications that we own may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our medicines in the United States or in other foreign countries. If this were to occur, early generic competition could be expected against our current medicines and other medicine candidates in development. There is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which prior art can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing based on a pending patent application. In particular, because the APIs in RAYOS, DUEXIS and PENNSAID 2% have been on the market as separate medicines for many years, it is possible that these medicines have previously been used off-label in such a manner that such prior usage would affect the validity of our patents or our ability to obtain patents based on our patent applications. In addition, claims directed to dosing and dose adjustment may be substantially less likely to issue in light of the Supreme Court decision in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., where the court held that claims directed to methods of determining whether to adjust drug dosing levels based on drug metabolite levels in the red blood cells were not patent eligible because they were directed to a law of nature. This decision may have wide-ranging implications on the validity and scope of pharmaceutical method claims.\nEven if patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge their validity, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed or invalidated.\nPatent litigation is currently pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Actavis. This case arises from Paragraph IV Patent Certification notice letters from Actavis advising they had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of PENNSAID 2% before the expiration of the patents-in-suit. For a more detailed description of the PENNSAID 2% litigation, see Note 16, Legal Proceedings, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPatent litigation is currently pending in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit against Dr. Reddy\u2019s for marketing a generic version of VIMOVO before the expiration of certain of our patents listed in the Orange Book. The case arises from Paragraph IV Patent Certification notice letters from Dr. Reddy\u2019s, advising that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of VIMOVO before the expiration of the patents-in-suit. On July 30, 2019, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals denied our request for a rehearing of the Court\u2019s invalidity ruling against the 6,926,907 and 8,557,285 patents for VIMOVO coordinated-release tablets. As a result, the District Court entered judgment in September 2019 invalidating the \u2018907 and \u2018285 patents, which ended any restriction against the FDA from granting final approval to Dr. Reddy\u2019s generic version of VIMOVO. On February 18, 2020, the FDA granted final approval for Dr. Reddy\u2019s generic version of VIMOVO. On February 27, 2020, Dr. Reddy\u2019s launched its generic version of VIMOVO in the United States. Patent litigation against Dr. Reddy\u2019s for infringement continues with respect to certain patents in the New Jersey District Court. We have repositioned our promotional efforts previously directed to VIMOVO to the other inflammation segment medicines and expect that our VIMOVO net sales will continue to decrease in future periods. For a more detailed description of the VIMOVO litigation, see Note 16, Legal Proceedings, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPatent litigation is currently pending in the Federal Circuit of Appeals and the United States District Court of New Jersey against Alkem and Teva USA, respectively, who each intend to market a generic version of DUEXIS prior to the expiration of certain of our patents listed in the Orange Book. These cases arise from Paragraph IV Patent Certification notice letters from Alkem and Teva USA advising they had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of DUEXIS before the expiration of the patents-in-suit. For a more detailed description of the DUEXIS litigation, see Note 16, Legal Proceedings, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPatent litigation is currently pending in the United States District Court of New Jersey against Lupin, who intends to market a generic version of PROCYSBI prior to the expiration of certain of our patents listed in the Orange Book. The case arises from Paragraph IV Patent Certification notice letter from Lupin advising it has filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of PROCYSBI before the expiration of the patents-in-suit. For a more detailed description of the PROCYSBI litigation, see Note 16, Legal Proceedings, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights relating to our medicines, but we cannot predict the outcome of the DUEXIS cases, the PENNSAID 2% case, and the PROCYSBI case. Any adverse outcome in these matters or any new generic challenges that may arise could result in one or more generic versions of our medicines being launched before the expiration of the listed patents, which could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute our business strategy to increase sales of our medicines, and would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations, including causing a significant decrease in our revenues and cash flows.\nFurthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims. If the patent applications we hold with respect to our medicines fail to issue or if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop them and threaten our ability to commercialize our medicines. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue or whether any issued patents will be found not invalid and not unenforceable or will go unthreatened by third parties. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, and some remain so until issued, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our medicines or any other medicine candidates. Furthermore, if third parties have filed such patent applications, an interference proceeding in the United States can be provoked by a third-party or instituted by us to determine which party was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our drug discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. Although we expect all of our employees to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques.\nFurther, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. For example, if the issuance, in a given country, of a patent to us, covering an invention, is not followed by the issuance, in other countries, of patents covering the same invention, or if any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability, or scope of the claims in, or the written description or enablement in, a patent issued in one country is not similar to the interpretation given to the corresponding patent issued in another country, our ability to protect our intellectual property in those countries may be limited. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no guarantee that we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license rights to technology from third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are party to a number of technology licenses that are important to our business and expect to enter into additional licenses in the future. For example, we rely on a license from Bausch with respect to technology developed by Bausch in connection with the manufacturing of RAVICTI. The purchase agreement under which Hyperion purchased the rights to RAVICTI contains obligations to pay Bausch regulatory and sales milestone payments relating to RAVICTI, as well as royalties on the net sales of RAVICTI. On May 31, 2013, when Hyperion acquired BUPHENYL under a restated collaboration agreement with Bausch, Hyperion received a license to use some of the manufacturing technology developed by Bausch in connection with the manufacturing of BUPHENYL. The restated collaboration agreement also contains obligations to pay Bausch regulatory and sales milestone payments, as well as royalties on net sales of BUPHENYL. If we fail to make a required payment to Bausch and do not cure the failure within the required time period, Bausch may be able to terminate the license to use its manufacturing technology for RAVICTI and BUPHENYL. If we lose access to the Bausch manufacturing technology, we cannot guarantee that an acceptable alternative method of manufacture could be developed or acquired. Even if alternative technology could be developed or acquired, the loss of the Bausch technology could still result in substantial costs and potential periods where we would not be able to market and sell RAVICTI and/or BUPHENYL. We also license intellectual property necessary for commercialization of RAVICTI from an external party. This party may be entitled to terminate the license if we breach the agreement, including failure to pay required royalties on net sales of RAVICTI, or we do not meet specified diligence obligations in our development and commercialization of RAVICTI, and we do not cure the failure within the required time period. If the license is terminated, it may be difficult or impossible for us to continue to commercialize RAVICTI, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe hold an exclusive, worldwide license from F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., or Roche, to patents and know-how for TEPEZZA. We also have exclusive sub-licenses for rights licensed to Roche for TEPEZZA by certain third-party licensors. Roche may have the right to terminate the license upon our breach, if not cured within a specified period of time. Roche may also terminate the license in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency, or if we challenge the validity of Roche\u2019s patents. If the license is terminated for our breach or based on our challenging the validity of Roche\u2019s patents, then all rights and licenses granted to us by Roche would also terminate, and we may be required to assign and transfer to Roche certain filings and approvals, trademarks, and data in our possession necessary for the development and commercialization of TEPEZZA, and assign clinical trial agreements to the extent permitted. We may also be required to grant Roche an exclusive license under our patents and know-how for TEPEZZA, and to manufacture and supply TEPEZZA to Roche for a transitional period. We also have a license of patent rights to TEPEZZA under a license agreement with Lundquist Institute (formerly known as Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center), or Lundquist. Lundquist has the right to terminate the license agreement upon our material breach, if not cured within a specified period of time, or in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency. If one or more of these licenses is terminated, it may be impossible for us to continue to commercialize TEPEZZA, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also hold an exclusive license to patents and technology from Duke University, or Duke, and Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or MVP, covering KRYSTEXXA. Duke and MVP may terminate the license if we commit fraud or for our willful misconduct or illegal conduct. Duke and MVP may also terminate the license upon our material breach of the agreement, if not cured within a specified period of time, or upon written notice if we have committed two or more material breaches under the agreement. Duke and MVP may also terminate the license in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency. If the license is terminated, it may be impossible for us to continue to commercialize KRYSTEXXA, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to contractual obligations under our amended and restated license agreement with UCSD, as amended, with respect to PROCYSBI. If one or more of these licenses was terminated, we would have no further right to use or exploit the related intellectual property, which would limit our ability to develop PROCYSBI in other indications, and could impact our ability to continue commercializing PROCYSBI in its approved indications.\nWe also license rights to know-how and trademarks for ACTIMMUNE from Genentech Inc., or Genentech. Genentech may terminate the agreement upon our material default, if not cured within a specified period of time. Genentech may also terminate the agreement in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency. Upon such a termination of the agreement, all intellectual property rights conveyed to us under the agreement, including the rights to the ACTIMMUNE trademark, revert to Genentech. If we fail to comply with our obligations under this agreement, we could lose the ability to market and distribute ACTIMMUNE, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe hold an exclusive license to Vectura Group plc\u2019s, or Vectura, proprietary technology and know-how covering the delayed release of corticosteroids relating to RAYOS. If we fail to comply with our obligations under our agreement with Vectura or our other license agreements, or if we are subject to a bankruptcy, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to market medicines covered by the license, including RAYOS.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Ordinary Shares\nThe market price of our ordinary shares historically has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of any investment in our ordinary shares.\nThe trading price of our ordinary shares has been volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report, these factors include:\n\u2022\nour failure to successfully execute our commercialization strategy with respect to our approved medicines, particularly our commercialization of our medicines in the United States;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and industry as well as the global economy;\n\u2022\nactions or announcements by third-party or government payers with respect to coverage and reimbursement of our medicines;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to intellectual property and other proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our medicines and medicine candidates;\n\u2022\nunanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our medicines;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory decisions;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our business, medicines or medicine candidates, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals or tax laws;\n\u2022\ninability to comply with our debt covenants and to make payments as they become due;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain adequate commercial supply for any approved medicine or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning our commercial partners, including but not limited to those with our sources of manufacturing supply;\n\u2022\nour decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial;\n\u2022\nadverse results or delays in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nour failure to successfully develop and/or acquire additional medicine candidates or obtain approvals for additional indications for our existing medicine candidates;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new medicines or services offered by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets, including the pharmaceutical sector, and general political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed revenue and financial projections that we may provide to the public;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community;\n\u2022\ninaccurate or significant adverse media coverage;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nour inability to successfully enter new markets;\n\u2022\nthe termination of a collaboration or the inability to establish additional collaborations;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour inability to maintain an adequate rate of growth;\n\u2022\nineffectiveness of our internal controls or our inability to otherwise comply with financial reporting requirements;\n\u2022\nadverse U.S. and foreign tax exposure;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management, commercial or regulatory personnel;\n\u2022\nissuances of debt or equity securities;\n\u2022\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or shareholder litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies to us;\n\u2022\nsales of our ordinary shares by us or our shareholders in the future;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our ordinary shares;\n\u2022\neffects of natural or man-made catastrophic events or other business interruptions; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and The Nasdaq Global Select Market and the stock of biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nWe have never declared or paid dividends on our share capital and we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future, including due to limitations that are currently imposed by our credit agreement and the indenture governing the 2027 Senior Notes. Any return to shareholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, of our ordinary share price.\nFuture sales and issuances of our ordinary shares, securities convertible into our ordinary shares or rights to purchase ordinary shares or convertible securities could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our shareholders and could cause our share price to decline.\nAdditional capital may be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for ordinary shares, our shareholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell ordinary shares, and we may sell convertible or exchangeable securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell such ordinary shares, convertible or exchangeable securities or other equity securities in subsequent transactions, existing shareholders may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of ordinary shares. We also maintain equity incentive plans, including our 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, 2014 Non-Employee Equity Plan, as amended, and 2020 Employee Share Purchase Plan, and intend to grant additional ordinary share awards under these and future plans, which will result in additional dilution to our existing shareholders.\nIrish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.\nIt may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the United States against us in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the United States currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically or necessarily be enforceable in Ireland.\nAs an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act 2014 (as amended), which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States.\nProvisions of our articles of association, and Irish law could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party.\nOur articles of association could delay, defer or prevent a third-party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our shareholders, or otherwise adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares. For example, our articles of association:\n\u2022\nimpose advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022\nstagger the terms of our board of directors into three classes; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of a supermajority of the voting power of the shares of our share capital entitled to vote generally at a meeting of shareholders to amend or repeal our articles of association.\nIn addition, several mandatory provisions of Irish law could prevent or delay an acquisition of us. For example, Irish law does not permit shareholders of an Irish public limited company to take action by written consent with less than unanimous consent. We are also subject to various provisions of Irish law relating to mandatory bids, voluntary bids, requirements to make a cash offer and minimum price requirements, as well as substantial acquisition rules and rules requiring the disclosure of interests in our ordinary shares in certain circumstances.\nThese provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discourage bids for our ordinary shares at a premium over the market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of, our ordinary shares. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and our other shareholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors, and could depress the market price of our ordinary shares.\nAny attempts to take us over will be subject to Irish Takeover Rules and subject to review by the Irish Takeover Panel.\nWe are subject to the Irish Takeover Rules, under which our board of directors will not be permitted to take any action which might frustrate an offer for our ordinary shares once it has received an approach which may lead to an offer or has reason to believe an offer is imminent.\nA transfer of our ordinary shares may be subject to Irish stamp duty.\nIn certain circumstances, the transfer of shares in an Irish incorporated company will be subject to Irish stamp duty, which is a legal obligation of the buyer. This duty is currently charged at the rate of 1.0 percent of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired, if higher. Because our ordinary shares are traded on a recognized stock exchange in the United States, an exemption from this stamp duty is available to transfers by shareholders who hold ordinary shares beneficially through brokers, which in turn hold those shares through the Depositary Trust Company, or DTC, to holders who also hold through DTC. However, a transfer by or to a record holder who holds ordinary shares directly in his, her or its own name could be subject to this stamp duty. We, in our absolute discretion and insofar as the Irish Companies Act 2014 (as amended) or any other applicable law permit, may, or may provide that one of our subsidiaries will pay Irish stamp duty arising on a transfer of our ordinary shares on behalf of the transferee of such ordinary shares. If stamp duty resulting from the transfer of ordinary shares which would otherwise be payable by the transferee is paid by us or any of our subsidiaries on behalf of the transferee, then in those circumstances, we will, on our behalf or on behalf of such subsidiary (as the case may be), be entitled to (i) seek reimbursement of the stamp duty from the transferee, (ii) set-off the stamp duty against any dividends payable to the transferee of those ordinary shares and (iii) claim a first and permanent lien on the ordinary shares on which stamp duty has been paid by us or such subsidiary for the amount of stamp duty paid. Our lien shall extend to all dividends paid on those ordinary shares.\nDividends paid by us may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax.\nIn certain circumstances, as an Irish tax resident company, we will be required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax (currently at the rate of 25%) from dividends paid to our shareholders. Shareholders that are resident in the United States, EU countries (other than Ireland) or other countries with which Ireland has signed a tax treaty (whether the treaty has been ratified or not) generally should not be subject to Irish withholding tax so long as the shareholder has provided its broker, for onward transmission to our qualifying intermediary or other designated agent (in the case of shares held beneficially), or our or its transfer agent (in the case of shares held directly), with all the necessary documentation by the appropriate due date prior to payment of the dividend. However, some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax, which could adversely affect the price of our ordinary shares.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2000, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., or Nasdaq, impose significant requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. These rules and regulations have substantially increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time-consuming and costly. These effects are exacerbated by our transition to an Irish company and the integration of numerous acquired businesses and operations into our historical business and operating structure. If these requirements divert the attention of our management and personnel from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increased costs will continue to decrease our net income or increase our net income (loss), and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our medicines or services. For example, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain and maintain director and officer liability insurance. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs that we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. If we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, our ordinary shares could be delisted from The Nasdaq Global Select Market, which would adversely affect the liquidity of our ordinary shares and our ability to obtain future financing.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we are required to perform annual system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404. Our independent registered public accounting firm is also required to deliver a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our testing, or the testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. Our compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial expense and expend significant management efforts, particularly because of our Irish parent company structure and international operations. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nNew laws and regulations as well as changes to existing laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules adopted by the SEC and by Nasdaq, would likely result in increased costs as we respond to their requirements.\nSecurities class action litigation could divert our management\u2019s attention and harm our business and could subject us to significant liabilities.\nThe stock markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the equity securities of pharmaceutical companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and biopharma companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. For example, following declines in our stock price, two federal securities class action lawsuits were filed in March 2016 against us and certain of our current and former officers alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which lawsuits were dismissed by the plaintiffs in June 2018. Even if we are successful in defending any similar claims that may be brought in the future, such litigation could result in substantial costs and may be a distraction to our management and may lead to an unfavorable outcome that could adversely impact our financial condition and prospects.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors, distributors and CROs may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, vendors, distributors and CROs may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or unauthorized activities that violate FDA regulations, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA, manufacturing standards, federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by our employees and other third parties may also include the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on us avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions and inter party reexamination proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the U.S. PTO. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which our collaborators are developing medicine candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our medicine candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our medicines and/or any other medicine candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications, which may later result in issued patents that our medicine candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our medicine candidates, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final medicine itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such medicine candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. Similarly, if any third-party patent were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable medicine candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nParties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our medicine candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties or redesign our infringing medicines, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our medicine candidates, and we have done so from time to time. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of our medicine candidates, which could harm our business significantly. We cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist which might be enforced against our medicines, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that one of our patents, or a patent of one of our licensors, is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nThere are numerous post grant review proceedings available at the U.S. PTO (including inter partes review, post-grant review and ex-parte reexamination) and similar proceedings in other countries of the world that could be initiated by a third-party that could potentially negatively impact our issued patents.\nInterference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our collaborators or licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our ordinary shares.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the U.S. PTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The U.S. PTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or licensors that control the prosecution and maintenance of our licensed patents fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our medicine candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of our employees\u2019 former employers or other third parties. We may also be subject to claims that former employers or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. There is no guarantee of success in defending these claims, and even if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and other employees.\nSales of a substantial number of our ordinary shares in the public market could cause our share price to decline.\nIf our existing shareholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our ordinary shares in the public market, the trading price of such ordinary shares could decline. In addition, our ordinary shares that are either subject to outstanding options and restricted stock units or reserved for future issuance under our employee benefit plans are or may become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. If these additional ordinary shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our ordinary shares will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our rating or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on our company regularly, demand for our ordinary shares could decrease, which might cause our share price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 12919, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "HZNP"}
