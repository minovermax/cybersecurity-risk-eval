RISK FACTORS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is having a material adverse effect on our business and liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is having an unprecedented impact on the U.S. economy as federal, state and local governments react to this public health crisis, which has created significant uncertainties. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the material adverse effect of the pandemic on the economy, our employees and customers, customer sentiment in general, and our bowling centers. The pandemic has materially adversely effected our near-term revenues, earnings, liquidity and cash flows, and has required significant actions in response, including but not limited to, employee furloughs and center closings, all in an effort to mitigate such impacts. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the outbreak within the U.S., the impact on capital and financial markets and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Adverse developments could cause us to liquidate our securities portfolio, seek debt financing or sell one or more of our operating properties, at prices and/or at times that are not favorable, in order to fund continuing operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will re-commence paying dividends in the future.\nFuture developments in the continuously changing pandemic environment, whether new mandated closures or restrictions, a worsening of the global and local economy, high unemployment rates, reduced consumer discretionary spending and other factors can negatively affect our business, however it is difficult to determine with much accuracy what the longer term impact could be. Many customers have returned to our centers for open play bowling and our fall league bowling season has begun better than expected. We remain at a mandated 50% capacity, but we have been able to be creative in making maximum use of space while following requirements. However, revenues from parties and corporate events are currently non-existent.\nThe pandemic continues, with the length, severity and possible resurgence unknown. Management believes the effects of the pandemic will continue to have an adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition, liquidity and operating results for fiscal 2021 and sometime after. This situation is changing rapidly, and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.", "PERMNO": 60898, "SIC": 7900, "TIC": "BWL.A"}
