Risk Factors\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those highlighted in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d that represent challenges that we face in connection with the successful implementation of our strategy and growth of our business. The occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Such risks include, but are not limited to:\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\n\u25cf We are an early stage company with a history of losses, and we expect to incur significant expenses and continuing losses.\n\u25cf We may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims.\n\u25cf We rely on a limited number of customers for a large portion of our revenues, and the loss of one or more such customers could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25cf Our business model requires further market penetration to drive growth and failure to expand would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business and could result in substantial liabilities that exceed our resources.\n\u25cf If we fail to manage our growth effectively, including failing to attract and integrate qualified personnel, we may not be able to develop, produce, market and sell our electrified powertrain solutions successfully.\n\u25cf Our success will depend on our ability to economically source and coordinate the installation of electrified powertrain solutions at scale, and our ability to develop and produce electrified powertrain solutions of sufficient quality and appeal to customers on schedule and at scale is unproven.\n\u25cf If we are unable to successfully produce our electrified powertrain solutions, our business will be harmed.\n\u25cf We are dependent on vehicle OEMs, upfitters and body builders to bring our electrified powertrain solutions to market, which is subject to risks.\n\u25cf Our future growth in Power Drive sales is dependent upon the fleet industry\u2019s willingness to adopt hybrid vehicles (\u201cxEVs\u201d).\n\u25cf We, the OEMs and our suppliers are subject to substantial regulation, and unfavorable changes to, or failure by us, the OEMs or our suppliers to comply with, these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results.\n\u25cf We are highly dependent on the services of Eric Tech, our Chief Executive Officer, and if we are unable to retain Mr. Tech, attract and retain key employees and hire qualified management, technical and vehicle engineering personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.\n\u25cf Future product recalls could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\u25cf Vehicles equipped with our electrified powertrain solutions will make use of lithium-ion battery cells, which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame.\n\u25cf We are or may be subject to risks associated with strategic alliances or acquisitions and may not be able to identify adequate strategic relationship opportunities, or form strategic relationships, in the future.\n\u25cf Our electrified powertrain solutions could face competition from original equipment manufacturers and other providers of electrification solutions that enter the commercial vehicle electrification market.\n\u25cf The performance characteristics of our electrified powertrain solutions, including fuel economy and emissions levels, may vary, including due to factors outside of our control.\n\u25cf Our suppliers may rely on complex machinery for our component production, which involves a significant degree of risk and uncertainty in terms of operational performance and costs.\n\u25cf Our manufacturing operations are dependent upon third-party suppliers, including, in certain cases, single-source suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages.\n\u25cf Increased warranty claims could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\u25cf Our electrified powertrain solutions rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and if these systems contain errors, bugs or vulnerabilities, or if we are unsuccessful in addressing or mitigating technical limitations in our systems, our business could be adversely affected.\n\u25cf If our electrified powertrain solutions fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our electrified powertrain solutions could be harmed.\n\u25cf Developments in alternative technology or improvements in the internal combustion engine may adversely affect the demand for our electrified powertrain solutions.\n\u25cf Our assumptions regarding the ability of our electrified powertrain solutions to limit carbon intensity and reduce GHG emissions and contribute to global decarbonization may be inaccurate.\n\u25cf We will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\n\u25cf Our management has limited experience in operating a public company.\n\u25cf We are subject to governmental export and import control laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\u25cf Our intellectual property applications for registration may not issue or be registered, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting products similar to ours.\n\u25cf Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited in connection with the Business Combination or other ownership changes.\n\u25cf We may not be able to obtain or agree on acceptable terms and conditions for all or a significant portion of the government grants, loans and other incentives for which we may apply. As a result, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\n\u25cf We have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic, the duration and economic, governmental and social impact of which is difficult to predict, which may significantly harm our business prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\n\u25cf Concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, directors and their respective affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\n\u25cf Reports published by analysts, including projections in those reports that differ from our actual results, could adversely affect the price and trading volume of our common stock, par value $0.0001 (\u201cCommon Stock\u201d).\n\u25cf Our charter contains anti-takeover provisions that could adversely affect the rights of our stockholders.\n\u25cf If securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our Common Stock adversely, the price and trading volume of our Common Stock could decline.\n\u25cf We may issue additional Common Stock or preferred stock, including under our equity incentive plan. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our stockholders and likely present other risks.\n\u25cf We are subject to legal proceedings including an SEC investigation, stockholder fiduciary duty suits, and shareholder class actions, and we may be subject to legal proceedings in the future including product liability, patent, copyright or trademark infringements, or trade secret misappropriation claims, which may be time-consuming and expensive, hinder execution of our business and growth strategy or negatively affect the price of our Common Stock.\nRisk Factors\nAn investment in our securities is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding whether to invest in our securities, you should consider carefully the risks described below, together with other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other information and documents we file with the SEC. The occurrence of any of the following risks could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects, as well as our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives. As a result, the trading price of our Common Stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations and stock price.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nOur future growth is dependent upon the fleet industry\u2019s willingness to adopt xEVs.\nOur growth in the Power Drives business is highly dependent upon the adoption of xEVs by the commercial and municipal fleet industry. If the market for xEVs and our electrified powertrain solutions does not develop at the rate or in the manner or to the extent that we expect, or if critical assumptions we have made regarding the efficiency of our electrified powertrain solutions are incorrect or incomplete, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be harmed. The fleet market for xEVs is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, numerous competitors including OEMs, evolving government regulation and industry standards and uncertain customer demands and behaviors.\nFactors that may influence the fleet market adoption of xEVs vehicles include:\n\u25cf perceptions about xEV quality, safety, design, performance, reliability and cost, especially if adverse events or accidents occur that are linked to the quality or safety of xEVs;\n\u25cf the availability of fully-electric vehicles, which some customers may prefer due to incentives and/or a preference to do without a combustion motor entirely;\n\u25cf the perceived willingness of vehicle OEMs to honor factory warranties on vehicles equipped with our powertrain solutions;\n\u25cf perceptions about vehicle safety in general, including the use of advanced technology, such as vehicle electronics, batteries and regenerative braking systems;\n\u25cf the decline of vehicle efficiency and/or range resulting from deterioration over time in the ability of the battery to hold a charge;\n\u25cf changes or improvements in the fuel economy of internal combustion engines, the vehicle and the vehicle controls or competitors\u2019 electrified systems;\n\u25cf the availability of service, charging and fueling and other associated costs for xEVs;\n\u25cf volatility in the cost of energy, electricity, oil and gasoline could affect buying decisions;\n\u25cf government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy, including new regulations mandating zero tailpipe emissions compared to overall carbon reduction;\n\u25cf the availability of tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate xEVs or future regulation requiring increased use of nonpolluting trucks; and\n\u25cf macroeconomic factors.\nAs an example, travel restrictions and social distancing efforts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have negatively impacted and will continue to negatively impact the commercial fleet industry, for an unknown, but potentially lengthy, period of time. Additionally, we may become subject to regulations that may require us to alter the design of our electrified powertrain solutions, which could negatively impact customer interest in our products.\nWe may in the future experience additional competition in current and potential future markets.\nWe work closely with traditional vehicle manufacturers to provide electrification solutions for their standard gas-powered vehicles. As a result, we have historically considered our relationship to such companies to be that of a market partner as opposed to a competitor. But as the vehicle electrification market continues to expand, traditional vehicle manufacturers may develop and market xEV solutions in larger vehicles or all electric versions of the same vehicles being deployed with our systems. In particular, Tesla, Inc. (\u201cTesla\u201d), Hyliion, Inc. (\u201cHyliion\u201d) and Nikola Corporation (\u201cNikola\u201d) have announced their plans to bring Class 8 long haul battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles to the market over the coming years. Cummins Inc., Daimler AG, Dana Incorporated, Navistar International Corporation, PACCAR Inc., Volvo Group, XOS Trucks and other commercial vehicle manufacturers have also announced their plans to bring Class 8 battery electric vehicles or fuel cell electric vehicles to the market.\nIn the event that traditional vehicle manufacturers develop xEV solutions that compete with vehicles outfitted with our electrification solutions, we will experience increased industry competition. Competitors may be able to deploy greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sales, marketing and support of their electric vehicles. Additionally, such competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger sales forces, broader customer and industry relationships and other resources than we do. We may experience competition with respect to recruiting and retaining qualified research and development, sales, marketing and management personnel, as well as further competition in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our products. Additional mergers and acquisitions may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. There are no assurances that customers will choose our electrified systems or vehicles over those of our competitors, and future competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are an early stage company with a history of losses, and we expect to incur significant expenses and continuing losses.\nWe incurred net income of approximately $28.8 million (a net loss of approximately $61.3 million after adjusting for the favorable change in fair value of warrant liability of approximately $90.1 million) for the year ended December 31, 2021 and net losses of approximately $60.6 million and $14.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We believe that we will continue to incur operating and net losses through the near future. We are currently conducting a review of the risks and opportunities of our current business and expect to adjust our future strategy based upon the findings of this analysis. Our future net income or loss will be dependent upon the determination and implementation of this future strategy. We expect the rate at which we will incur future losses will be impacted by the following:\n\u25cf Costs which may be incurred in connection with the realignment of our business strategy, product offerings, research and development;\n\u25cf Costs to develop our electrified powertrain solutions;\n\u25cf Investment in and utilization of inventories of parts and components;\n\u25cf Expansion of our product and service offerings in our XL Grid energy efficiency and infrastructure offerings;\n\u25cf Increase in our general and administrative functions to support our public company obligations; and\n\u25cf Acquisition and integration of other businesses.\nBecause we will incur the costs and expenses from these efforts before we receive any incremental revenues with respect thereto, our losses in future periods are expected to be significant. In addition, we may find that these efforts are more expensive than we currently anticipate or that these efforts may not result in revenues, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and further increase our losses.\nWe may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims.\nProduct liability claims, even those without merit or those that do not involve our products, could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. The automobile industry in particular experiences significant product liability claims, and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our electric powertrain solutions do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected. As is true for other commercial vehicle suppliers, we expect in the future that our electrified powertrain solutions will be installed on vehicles that will be involved in crashes resulting in death or personal injury. Additionally, product liability claims that affect our competitors may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our products.\nWhile we maintain product liability insurance, our coverage may not be adequate to cover certain product liability claims, and we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs. A successful product liability claim that exceeds our policy limits could require us to pay substantial sums. Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the relatively limited number of electrified powertrain solutions delivered to date and limited field experience of our products. Moreover, a product liability claim against us or our competitors could generate substantial negative publicity about our products and business and could have a material adverse effect on our brand, reputation, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe rely on a limited number of customers for a large portion of our revenues, and the loss of one or more such customers could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, we had two customers that accounted for 78% of our revenue. The loss of these customers could have a significant impact on our revenues and harm our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to further penetrate the fleet or energy efficiency/infrastructure markets or enter into new markets in the future.\nOur success, and our ability to increase revenue and operate profitably, depends in part on our ability to expand our customer base into markets and products in which we can operate profitably. We are currently evaluating the risk and opportunities within our current businesses and based upon this evaluation may modify our future strategy. For our current businesses, for example, our success will in part be based upon further penetrating the fleet markets comprised of corporations, municipalities and public utilities along with expansion into new markets. And, in our XL Grid business, success will in part be based upon growing the base of energy efficiency and infrastructure customers, both in our current Northeast region, but also more broadly. If we are unable to meet our customers\u2019 performance requirements or industry specifications limiting expansion into existing or new markets, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to adequately control the costs associated with our operations.\nWe are in the process of a strategic review to evaluate our offerings, processes, and growth opportunities to ensure that we are charting the proper strategic direction. As a preliminary result of this strategic review, we have decided to narrow our operational focus to more effectively and judiciously execute on our strategy moving forward. We are focusing our effort and resources on what we consider to be the most profitable areas of our business and reducing some aspects of our hybrid offering. As part of this plan to narrow our focus, we have taken some actions to align our team and resources to better reflect our near-term needs. As part of this, we have eliminated 51 full-time positions across the organization in February to ensure that we are operating efficiently. We will require capital to develop our business, including developing and producing our electrified powertrain solutions, our energy efficiency and infrastructure business and any new businesses that we may enter into. We expect to incur expenses which will impact our profitability, including research and development expenses, raw material procurement costs, sales and distribution expenses as we manage our brand and market our products and services, and general and administrative expenses as we scale our operations and incur costs as a public company. Our ability to become profitable in the future will depend on our ability to deliver products and solutions that meet customer and market demands in a profitable manner and manage our expenses efficiently. If we are unable deliver these profitable solutions, our margins, profitability and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business model requires further market penetration to drive growth and failure to expand would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business and could result in substantial liabilities that exceed our resources.\nIt is difficult to predict our future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses, and we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods, our operating results and financial position could be materially affected. Our future results depend on the successful implementation of our management\u2019s growth strategies - including the launch of new products and services - and are based on assumptions and events over which we have only partial or no control. These initiatives and products may not generate as much revenue, cost more to bring to market, and create greater liabilities than we anticipate. We will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early stage companies, including scaling up our infrastructure and headcount, and may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties or delays in connection with our growth. In addition, as a result of the capital-intensive nature of our business, we may sustain substantial operating expenses without generating sufficient revenues to cover expenditures.\nWe may require continued capital investment.\nWe expect to have sufficient capital for the next 12 months for the design, development and manufacture of our products. However, we may require additional capital investment in the future to fund operations, continue research and development and improve infrastructure. There can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital we need on favorable terms when required or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our financial condition and business could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, including failing to attract and integrate qualified personnel, we may not be able to develop, produce, market and sell our products and services successfully.\nAny failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. While the Company intends to narrow our focus in the Power Drive business in 2022 to concentrate on those areas of that business that we consider to be the most profitable, we intend to grow our operations in those remaining areas. We expect our future growth to include:\n\u25cf expanding the management team;\n\u25cf hiring and training new personnel;\n\u25cf forecasting production and revenue;\n\u25cf controlling expenses and investments in anticipation of expanded operations;\n\u25cf implementing and enhancing administrative infrastructure, systems and processes; and\n\u25cf acquiring other businesses.\nOver the long-term, we intend to continue to hire additional personnel as needed for our current and future business. Because we operate in evolving technology fields, such as vehicle electrification, energy efficiency and vehicle charging, individuals with sufficient training may not be available to hire, and as a result, we will need to expend significant time and expense training any newly hired employees.\nCompetition for individuals with this experience is intense, and we may not be able to attract, integrate, train, motivate or retain additional highly qualified personnel. The failure to attract, integrate, train, motivate and retain these additional employees could seriously harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur success within our Power Drives business will depend on our ability to economically source and coordinate the installation of electrified powertrain solutions at scale, and our ability to develop and produce electrified powertrain solutions of sufficient quality and appeal to customers on schedule and at scale is unproven.\nOur Power Drives business depends in large part on our ability to execute our plan to develop, produce, assemble, market, sell, install and service our electrified powertrain solutions. In particular, we rely on Parker Hannifin Corporation to supply all of our motors. We further rely on other third parties to supply batteries, wire harnesses and inverters, each of which are used in our electrified powertrain solutions. We currently source all components and assemble them into systems which are sent to our upfitter partners. These upfitter partners then install and commission our electrified powertrain solutions. While these arrangements can lower operating costs and enable rapid increases in installations, they also reduce our direct control over installation. Such diminished control may have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products or services, or our flexibility to respond to changing conditions.\nWe rely on single-source suppliers to supply and produce certain components and rely on upfitter partners for installation of our electrified powertrain solutions. Any failure of these suppliers or partners to perform could require us to seek alternative suppliers or to expand our production capabilities, which could incur additional costs and have a negative impact on our cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, production, logistics in supply or production areas, or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, military actions, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues or international trade disputes.\nWe, along with our supply chain and upfitter partners, have limited experience to date in high volume production of our electrified powertrain solutions. We do not know if the sources of component supply and/or upfitters at scale will remain reliable to enable us to meet the quality, price, engineering, design and production standards, as well as the production volumes, required to successfully mass market our electrified powertrain solutions. Even if we and our upfitter partners are successful in developing our high volume production capability and processes and in reliably sourcing our component supply, we do not know whether we will be able to do so in a manner that avoids significant delays and cost overruns, including as a result of factors beyond our control such as problems with suppliers and vendors, or in time to meet our vehicle commercialization schedules or to satisfy the requirements of customers. Any failure to develop such production processes and capabilities within our projected costs and timelines could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may experience significant delays in the design, production and launch of our electrified powertrain solutions, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nAny delay in the financing, design, production and launch of our electrified powertrain solutions could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. There are often delays in the design, production and commercial release of new products, and to the extent these delays postpone the launch of new electrified powertrain solutions, our growth prospects could be adversely affected as we may fail to grow our market share. We integrate electrified solutions into OEM vehicles, and if the OEM makes unexpected changes to the function of the vehicle, this could significantly delay the development and therefore launch of our electrified powertrain solutions. We will rely on upfitter partners to install our electrified powertrain solutions, and if they are not able to produce product at scale or meet our specifications, we may need to expand our production capabilities, which would cause us to incur additional costs. Furthermore, we rely on third-party suppliers for the provision and development of many of the key components and materials used in our electrified powertrain solutions, and to the extent they experience any delays, we may need to seek alternative suppliers. If we experience delays by our suppliers, we could experience delays in delivering on our timelines.\nIf we are unable to successfully produce our electrified powertrain solutions, our business will be harmed.\nThere are numerous potential ways we could be unable to produce our electrified powertrain solutions. Our suppliers\u2019 production facilities, which are used to produce components for our electrified powertrain solutions, would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to replace and qualify for use. Our suppliers\u2019 production facilities may be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, fire and power outages, or by health epidemics, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to produce our electrified powertrain solutions for some period of time. The inability to produce our electrified powertrain solutions or the backlog that could develop if our production facilities and the production facilities of our outsourcing partners and suppliers are inoperable for even a short period of time may result in the loss of customers or harm our reputation. Although we maintain insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to our on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe are dependent on vehicle OEMs, upfitters and body builders to bring our electrified powertrain solutions to market, all of which are subject to risks.\nBecause we do not manufacture complete vehicles, we are dependent on vehicle OEMs and body builders to provide vehicle chassis for our electrified powertrain solutions. We rely on upfitters for the installation of our electrified powertrain solutions. Reliance on OEMs, body builders and upfitters for the production and installation of our electrified powertrain solutions is subject to risks with respect to operations that are outside our control. By way of example, the current global microchip shortage significantly limited the availability of chassis from several vehicle OEMs in the current year. If OEMs or body builders are not able to produce vehicle chassis and provide them to us or upfitters, or a change in governmental regulations or policies occurs, we would need to develop our own vehicle on which to install our electrified powertrain solutions. Either case could have a negative impact on our ability to sell our electrified powertrain solutions at anticipated prices or margins or in expected timeframes. Additionally, we may permit returns of vehicles installed with our electrified powertrain solutions, which may result in significant additional costs to us if we are required to convert the vehicles back to their original form. There is risk of potential disputes with our upfitters, and we could be affected by negative publicity related to our upfitter partners whether or not such publicity is related to their collaboration with us. Our ability to successfully build a premium brand could also be adversely affected by perceptions about the quality of our upfitter partners\u2019 workmanship. In addition, although we are involved in each step of the supply chain, production and installation processes, because we also rely on our upfitter partners and suppliers to meet our quality standards, there can be no assurance that the final product will meet expected quality standards.\nWe may be unable to enter into new agreements or extend existing agreements with upfitter partners on terms and conditions acceptable to us and therefore may need to contract with other third parties or significantly add to our own production capacity. There can be no assurance that in such event we would be able to engage other third parties or establish or expand our own production capacity to meet our needs on acceptable terms or at all. The expense and time required to complete any transition, and to assure that our electrified powertrain solutions produced at facilities of new producers comply with our quality standards and regulatory requirements, may be greater than anticipated. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur ability to sell electrified powertrain solutions depends on compatibility with various OEM vehicle models and characteristics. The pace of change of these models and changing model availability is outside of our control and could create adverse conditions and materially affect our financial results.\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, some of which are single or limited source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our systems for powertrains at prices and volumes, performance and specifications acceptable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for the provision and development of certain key components and materials used in our electrified powertrain solutions. While we plan to obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible, some of the critical components used in our vehicles will be purchased by us from a single source or a limited number of sources. For example, we purchase all of our motors from a single supplier, Parker Hannifin Corporation.\nOur third-party suppliers may not be able to meet their product specifications and performance characteristics, which would impact our ability to achieve our product specifications and performance characteristics as well. Additionally, our third-party suppliers may be unable to obtain required certifications for their products which we plan to use or provide warranties that are necessary for our solutions. If we are unable to obtain components and materials used in our electrified powertrain solutions from our suppliers or if our suppliers decide to create or supply a competing product, our business could be adversely affected. While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components for our single source components, we may be unable to do so in the short term (or at all) or at prices or quality levels that are favorable to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur manufacturing operations are dependent upon third-party suppliers, including, in certain cases, single-source suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages.\nThird-party suppliers provide us with raw materials, parts and manufactured components (\u201cThird Party Supplies\u201d). Any delay in receiving Third Party Supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and, accordingly, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. The volatility in the financial markets and uncertainty in the automotive sector could result in exposure related to the financial viability of certain of our suppliers. Suppliers may also exit certain business lines, causing us to find other suppliers for materials or components. Finding new suppliers could potentially delay our ability to timely deliver products to customers and such new suppliers may also change the terms on which they are willing to provide products to us, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, many of our suppliers have unionized workforces that could be subject to work stoppages as a result of labor relations issues. The outbreak of COVID-19 resulted in work stoppages at certain suppliers that are part of our supply chain. The ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in additional work stoppages at our suppliers in the future. All manufacturing operations at our plants are subject to change based on market conditions, component supplier disruptions, government regulations, and the continued spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. If work stoppages were to be implemented, there could be resulting supply shortages that could impact our ability to deliver our products to our customers on schedule and, accordingly, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Some of our suppliers are the sole source for a particular supply item (e.g., the majority of motors, certain batteries, and inverters) and cannot be quickly or inexpensively re-sourced to another supplier due to long lead times and contractual commitments that might be required by another supplier in order to provide the component or materials. Even as production resumes by us and our suppliers, production volumes may be volatile and we may need to modify our production environment to ensure the health and safety of our workers and customers. If we are unsuccessful in managing a re-start of our production, our results of operations may be materially affected. In addition to the risks described above regarding interruption of Third Party Supplies, which are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, the exclusive supplier of a component potentially could exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims or other terms relating to a component. Additionally, our suppliers may prioritize their resources for any long-term commitments to third parties or larger customers and to our detriment. We may not be in a position to find alternate suppliers in a timely manner to continue to operate consistent with our obligations to or expectations of our customers.\nWe, the OEMs and our suppliers are subject to substantial regulation, and unfavorable changes to, or failure by us, the OEMs or our suppliers to comply with, these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nOur electrified powertrain solutions, and the sale of motor vehicles in general, are subject to substantial regulation under international, federal, state and local laws. OEMs and our suppliers also are currently, or may in the future, become subject to such regulations. Our energy efficiency and infrastructure business is subject to regulation and funding for projects can be through rebates and incentives, which evolve over time and are complex. We continue to evaluate requirements for licenses, approvals, certificates and governmental authorizations necessary to manufacture, sell or service our electrified powertrain solutions in the jurisdictions in which we plan to operate and intend to take such actions necessary to comply. We may experience difficulties in obtaining or complying with various licenses, approvals, certifications and other governmental authorizations necessary to manufacture, sell or service our electrified powertrain solutions in any of these jurisdictions. If we, OEMs or our suppliers are unable to obtain or comply with any of the licenses, approvals, certifications or other governmental authorizations necessary to carry out our operations in the jurisdictions in which they currently operate, or those jurisdictions in which they plan to operate in the future, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. We expect to incur significant costs in complying with these regulations. Regulations related to the vehicle industry are evolving and we face risks associated with changes to these regulations, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf increased subsidies for corn and ethanol production, which could reduce the operating cost of vehicles that use ethanol or a combination of ethanol and gasoline;\n\u25cf low oil prices; and\n\u25cf increased support from local, state and federal governments for other alternative fuel systems, such as but not limited to hydrogen, natural gas and bio-fuels, which could have an impact on the acceptance of our electrified powertrain solutions.\nTo the extent the laws change, our electrified powertrain solutions and our suppliers\u2019 products may not comply with applicable international, federal, state or local laws, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Compliance with changing regulations could be burdensome, time consuming and expensive. To the extent compliance with new regulations is cost prohibitive, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of some of our direct customers, which subjects us to the risk of non-payment for our products.\nWe distribute our electrified powertrain solutions through a network of upfitters, OEMs and OEM dealers, some of which may not be well-capitalized and may be of a lower credit quality. This direct customer network subjects us to the risk of non-payment for our electrified powertrain solutions. We sell our energy efficiency services to both commercial and municipal customers, and in many cases funding is provided under utility provided incentives. There is credit risk in collecting from these customers. In addition, during periods of economic downturn in the global economy, our exposure to credit risks from our direct customers may increase, and our efforts to monitor and mitigate the associated risks may not be effective. In the event of non-payment by one or more direct customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may need to raise additional funds, which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected.\nThe design, production, sale and servicing of our electrified powertrain solutions and other businesses we may enter into is capital-intensive. We may raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from government or financial institutions. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our long-term business prospects among customers and analysts and within our industry, or are subject to negative publicity, then our financial condition, operating results, business prospects and access to capital may suffer materially.\nCustomers may be less likely to purchase our products and services if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our service and support and other operations will continue in the long term. Similarly, suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed. Accordingly, in order to build and maintain our business, we must maintain confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts, ratings agencies and other parties in our products, long-term financial viability and business prospects. Maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by certain factors including those that are largely outside of our control, such as customer unfamiliarity with our electric powertrain solutions, any delays in scaling production, delivery and service operations to meet demand, competition and uncertainty regarding the future of our products or our other services and our production and sales performance compared with market expectations.\nIf we are unable to address the service requirements of our customers, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nWith further market penetration and expansion into new markets, we may increase our servicing network of our electrified powertrain solutions. Servicing xEVs is different than servicing traditional vehicles and requires specialized skills, including high voltage training and servicing techniques. We partner with upfitters to perform some or all of the servicing on our electrified powertrain solutions, and will need to expand our service network. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into an acceptable arrangement with any such third-party provider. Our customers will also depend on our customer support team to resolve technical and operational issues relating to the integrated software underlying our electrified powertrain solutions. Our ability to provide effective customer support is largely dependent on our ability to attract, train and retain qualified personnel with experience in supporting customers on platforms such as ours. As we continue to grow, additional pressure may be placed on our customer support team, and we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for technical support. We also may be unable to modify the future scope and delivery of our technical support to compete with changes in the technical support provided by our competitors. Increased customer demand for support, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and negatively affect our operating results. If we are unable to successfully address the service requirements of our customers or establish a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, we may be subject to claims from our customers, including loss of revenue or damages, and our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Eric Tech, our Chief Executive Officer, and if we are unable to retain Mr. Tech, attract and retain key employees and hire qualified management, technical and vehicle engineering personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to retain our key personnel. We are highly dependent on the services of Eric Tech, our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Tech is the source of many of the ideas and execution driving our company. If Mr. Tech were to discontinue his service to us due to death, disability or any other reason, we would be significantly disadvantaged. The unexpected loss of or failure to retain one or more of our key employees could adversely affect our business.\nOur success also depends, in part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, attract, train and develop other highly qualified personnel. Experienced and highly skilled employees are in high demand and competition for these employees can be intense, and our ability to hire, attract and retain them depends on our ability to provide competitive compensation. We may not be able to attract, assimilate, develop or retain qualified personnel in the future, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, including the execution of our global business strategy. We do not maintain, and we do not expect to maintain in the future, key man life insurance policies with respect to Eric Tech. Any failure by our management team and our employees to perform as expected may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe face significant barriers to enter new markets, and if we cannot successfully overcome those barriers, our business will be negatively impacted.\nThe commercial trucking industry has traditionally been characterized by significant barriers to entry, including the ability to meet performance requirements or industry specifications, acceptance by OEMs and end users, investment costs of design and production, the need for specialized design and development expertise, regulatory requirements, establishing a brand name and image and the need to establish sales capabilities. If we are not able to overcome these barriers, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be negatively impacted and our ability to grow our business will be harmed.\nFuture product recalls could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nIn 2019 we experienced two recalls that were subsequently remediated. During 2021, we incurred additional warranty claims for our electrified powertrain solutions. In the future, we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate a recall if any of our products (including the batteries we design, develop and include in our systems) prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards. Such recalls involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and other resources, which could adversely affect our brand image, as well as our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nIncreases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of our components, particularly battery cells, could harm our business.\nIn the production of our electrified powertrain solutions, we have experienced, and in the future may again experience, increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of our components. Any such increase or supply interruption could materially negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. The prices for our components fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. For instance, we are exposed to multiple risks relating to price fluctuations for battery cells. These risks include:\n\u25cf the inability or unwillingness of current battery manufacturers to build or operate battery cell production facilities to supply the numbers of battery cells required to support the growth of the electric vehicle industry as demand for such cells increases;\n\u25cf disruption in the supply of cells due to quality issues or recalls by the battery cell manufacturers; and\n\u25cf an increase in the cost of raw materials.\nAny disruption in the supply of battery cells could temporarily disrupt production of our electrified powertrain solutions until a different supplier is fully qualified. Moreover, battery cell manufacturers may refuse to supply electric vehicle manufacturers if they determine that the vehicles are not sufficiently safe. Furthermore, fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions have in the past and may again in the future cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges. Substantial increases in the prices for raw materials have in the past and may again in the future increase the cost of our components and consequently, the costs of products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recoup increasing costs of our components by increasing prices, which could reduce our margins.\nVehicles equipped with our electrified powertrain solutions make use of lithium-ion battery cells, which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame.\nThe battery packs within our electrified powertrain solutions make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While the battery pack is designed to contain any single cell\u2019s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce could occur, which could subject us to lawsuits, product recalls, or redesign efforts, all of which would be time consuming and expensive. Also, negative public perceptions regarding the suitability of lithium-ion cells for automotive applications or any future incident involving lithium-ion cells, such as a vehicle or other fire, even if such incident does not involve our vehicles, could seriously harm our business and reputation.\nIn addition, we store battery packs in our facility prior to sending such battery packs to upfitters for installation on vehicles. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of our facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, a safety issue or fire related to the cells could disrupt our operations. Such damage or injury could lead to adverse publicity and potentially a safety recall. Moreover, any failure of a competitor\u2019s electric vehicle or energy storage product may cause indirect adverse publicity for us and our products. Such adverse publicity could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the global COVID-19 pandemic, the duration and economic, governmental and social impact of which is difficult to predict, which may significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nThere has been a widespread worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected as a result. Numerous government regulations and public advisories, as well as shifting social behaviors, have temporarily limited or closed non-essential transportation, government functions, business activities and person-to-person interactions, and the duration of such trends is difficult to predict. Reduced operations and production line shutdowns at vehicle OEMs due to COVID-19, limitations on travel by our personnel and personnel of our customers, and future delays or shutdowns of vehicle OEMs or our suppliers could impact our ability to meet customer orders. We also instituted certain temporary cost reduction measures such as reducing or deferring discretionary spending.\nOur operations and timelines may also be affected by global economic markets and levels of consumer comfort and spending, which could impact demand in the worldwide transportation industries. Because the impact of current conditions on an ongoing basis is yet largely unknown, is rapidly evolving and has been varied across geographic regions, this ongoing assessment will be particularly critical to allow us to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our workforce and other resources accordingly. If current global market conditions continue or worsen, or if we cannot or do not resume reduced operations at a rate commensurate with such conditions or resume full operational capacity and are later required to or choose to reduce such operations again, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed.\nOur financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2022 and future periods may be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 outbreak or other outbreak of infectious disease or similar public health threat.\nCOVID-19 continues to spread globally and has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns. These measures have impacted and may continue to impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective suppliers. We have experienced some disruptions in supply from some of our suppliers. Additionally, we have experienced a shift in customer demand. There is considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures. Restrictions on access to our support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for our vendors and suppliers, and restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures, and increased border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet customer demand, lead to increased costs and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. These uncertainties also make it more difficult for us to assess the quality of our product order backlog and to estimate future financial results. The current outbreak of COVID-19 has caused an economic slowdown, and it is increasingly likely that its continued spread will lead to a global recession, which could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed. In addition, in light of concerns about the spread of COVID-19, our workforce has at times been operating at reduced levels at our facilities, which may continue to have an adverse impact on our ability to timely meet future customer orders.\nThe duration of the business disruption and related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. However, it may materially affect our ability to obtain materials, deliver products in a timely manner, and it also may impair our ability to meet customer demand for products, result in lost sales, additional costs, or penalties, or damage our reputation. The extent to which COVID-19 or any other health epidemic will further impact our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others.\nAdditionally, we have experienced and may continue to experience demand uncertainty as a result of COVID-19. This demand uncertainty is expected to continue into fiscal year 2022, with delays in the government response and postponements and reductions of orders of our products by both commercial and municipal departments. In addition, we believe that the impact of the global microchip shortage that the entire industry is currently experiencing will adversely impact our operating results in fiscal year 2021. Given the uncertainty related to vaccination speed and rates and potential impacts of new variants of COVID- 19, there continues to be pandemic related risk to our results. The extent to which these impacts on demand may continue, and the effect they may have on our business and operating results, will depend upon future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.\nOur insurance strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims against us, for which we may have no insurance coverage. While we currently carry commercial general liability, commercial automobile liability, excess liability and workers\u2019 compensation policies, we may not maintain sufficient insurance coverage, and in some cases, we may not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claims against us. A loss that is uninsured or exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are or may be subject to risks associated with strategic alliances or acquisitions and may not be able to identify adequate strategic relationship opportunities, or form strategic relationships, in the future.\nWe have entered into strategic alliances, and may in the future enter into additional strategic alliances or joint ventures or minority equity investments, in each case with various third parties for the production of our electrified powertrain solutions as well as with other collaborators with capabilities on data and analytics, engineering and installation channels. These alliances subject us to a number of risks, including risks associated with sharing proprietary information, non-performance by the third party and increased expenses in establishing new strategic alliances, any of which may materially and adversely affect our business. We may have limited ability to monitor or control the actions of these third parties and, to the extent any of these strategic third parties suffers negative publicity or harm to their reputation from events relating to their business, we may also suffer negative publicity or harm to our reputation by virtue of our association with any such third party.\nStrategic business relationships will be an important factor in the growth and success of our business. However, there are no assurances that we will be able to continue to identify or secure suitable business relationship opportunities in the future or our competitors may capitalize on such opportunities before we do. Moreover, identifying such opportunities could require substantial management time and resources, and negotiating and financing relationships involves significant costs and uncertainties. If we are unable to successfully source and execute on strategic relationship opportunities in the future, our overall growth could be impaired, and our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWhen appropriate opportunities arise, we may acquire additional assets, products, technologies or businesses that are complementary to our existing business. In addition to possible stockholder approval, we may need approvals and licenses from relevant government authorities for the acquisitions and to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, which could result in increased delay and costs, and may disrupt our business strategy if we fail to do so. Furthermore, acquisitions and the subsequent integration of new assets and businesses into our own require significant attention from our management and could result in a diversion of resources from our existing business, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our operations. Acquired assets or businesses may not generate the financial results we expect and, given prevailing investment interest in the vehicle electrification sector, may command inflated purchase consideration, excessive growth investment and/or generate significant near term operating losses. Acquisitions could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the occurrence of significant goodwill impairment charges, amortization expenses for other intangible assets and exposure to potential unknown liabilities of the acquired business. Moreover, the costs of identifying and consummating acquisitions may be significant.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks to operational systems, security systems, infrastructure, integrated software in our electrified powertrain solutions and customer data processed by our or third-party vendors or suppliers and any material failure, weakness, interruption, cyber event, incident or breach of security could prevent us from effectively operating our business.\nWe are at risk for interruptions, outages and breaches of: (a) operational systems, including business, financial, accounting, product development, data processing or production processes, owned by us or our third-party vendors or suppliers; (b) facility security systems, owned by us or our third-party vendors or suppliers; (c) transmission control modules or other in-product technology, owned by us or our third-party vendors or suppliers; (d) the integrated software in our electrified powertrain solutions; or (e) customer or driver data that our processes or our third-party vendors or suppliers process on our behalf. Such cyber incidents could: materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise certain information of customers, employees, suppliers, drivers or others; jeopardize the security of our facilities; or affect the performance of transmission control modules or other in-product technology and the integrated software in our electrified powertrain solutions. A cyber incident could be caused by disasters, insiders (through inadvertence or with malicious intent) or malicious third parties (including nation-states or nation-state supported actors) using sophisticated, targeted methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption and other security defenses, including hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception. The techniques used by cyber attackers change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we maintain information technology measures designed to protect ourselves against intellectual property theft, data breaches and other cyber incidents, such measures will require updates and improvements, and we cannot guarantee that such measures will be adequate to detect, prevent or mitigate cyber incidents. The implementation, maintenance, segregation and improvement of these systems requires significant management time, support and cost. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving, expanding and updating current systems, including the disruption of our data management, procurement, production execution, finance, supply chain and sales and service processes. These risks may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory, procure parts or supplies or produce, sell, deliver and service our electric powertrain solutions, adequately protect our intellectual property or achieve and maintain compliance with, or realize available benefits under, applicable laws, regulations and contracts. We cannot be sure that these systems upon which we rely, including those of our third-party vendors or suppliers, will be effectively implemented, maintained or expanded as planned. If we do not successfully implement, maintain or expand these systems as planned, our operations may be disrupted, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be impaired, and deficiencies may arise in our internal control over financial reporting, which may impact our ability to certify our financial results. Moreover, our proprietary information or intellectual property could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected. If these systems do not operate as we expect them to, we may be required to expend significant resources to make corrections or find alternative sources for performing these functions.\nA significant cyber incident could impact production capability, harm our reputation, cause us to breach our contracts with other parties or subject us to regulatory actions or litigation, any of which could materially affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. In addition, our insurance coverage for cyberattacks may not be sufficient to cover all the losses we may experience as a result of a cyber-incident.\nWe also collect, store, transmit and otherwise process customer, driver and employee and others\u2019 data as part of our business and operations, which may include personal data or confidential or proprietary information. We also work with partners and third-party service providers or vendors that collect, store and process such data on our behalf and in connection with our products and services. There can be no assurance that any security measures that we or our third-party service providers or vendors have implemented will be effective against current or future security threats. While we have developed systems and processes designed to protect the availability, integrity, confidentiality and security of our and our customers\u2019, drivers\u2019, employees\u2019 and others\u2019 data, our security measures or those of our third-party service providers or vendors could fail and result in unauthorized access to or disclosure, acquisition, encryption, modification, misuse, loss, destruction or other compromise of such data. If a compromise of such data were to occur, we may become liable under our contracts with other parties and under applicable law for damages and incur penalties and other costs to respond to, investigate and remedy such an incident. Laws in all 50 states require us to provide notice to customers, regulators, credit reporting agencies and others when certain sensitive information has been compromised as a result of a security breach. Such laws are inconsistent and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach could be costly. Depending on the facts and circumstances of such an incident, these damages, penalties, fines and costs could be significant. Such an event could harm our reputation and result in litigation against us. Any of these results could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nAny unauthorized control or manipulation of the information technology systems in our electrified powertrain solutions could result in loss of confidence in us and our electrified powertrain solutions and harm our business.\nOur electrified powertrain solutions contain complex information technology systems and built-in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote updates to improve or update functionality. We have designed, implemented and tested security measures intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology networks, our electrified powertrain solutions and related systems. However, hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access to modify, alter and use such networks and systems to gain control of or to change our electrified powertrain solutions\u2019 functionality, user interface and performance characteristics, or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicles. Future vulnerabilities could be identified and our efforts to remediate such vulnerabilities may not be successful. Any unauthorized access to or control of our electrified powertrain solutions, or any loss of customer data, could result in legal claims or proceedings and remediation of such problems could result in significant, unplanned capital expenditures. In addition, regardless of their veracity, reports of unauthorized access to our electrified powertrain solutions or data, as well as other factors that may result in the perception that our electrified powertrain solutions or data are capable of being \u201chacked,\u201d could negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to evolving laws, regulations, standards and contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our reputation, subject us to significant fines and liability or adversely affect our business.\nWe intend to use our in-vehicle services and functionality to log information about each vehicle\u2019s use in order to aid our in-vehicle diagnostics and servicing. Our customers or their drivers may object to the use of this data, which may increase our vehicle maintenance costs and harm our business prospects. Collection of our customers\u2019, employees\u2019 and others\u2019 information in conducting our business may subject us to various legislative and regulatory burdens related to data privacy and security that could require notification of data breaches, restrict our use of such information and hinder our ability to acquire new customers or market to existing customers. The regulatory framework for data privacy and security is rapidly evolving, and we may not be able to monitor and react to all developments in a timely manner. For example, California requires connected devices to maintain minimum information security requirements. As legislation continues to develop, we will likely be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures and internal processes to comply with such legislation. In addition, non-compliance with these laws or a significant breach of our third-party service providers\u2019 or vendors\u2019 or our own network security and systems could have serious negative consequences for our business and future prospects, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced customer demand for our vehicles and harm to our reputation and brand.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and cause delays in building our production facilities.\nOur operations are and will be subject to international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including laws relating to the use, handling, storage, disposal of and human exposure to hazardous materials. Environmental and health and safety laws and regulations can be complex, and we have limited experience complying with them. Moreover, we expect that we will be affected by future amendments to such laws or other new environmental and health and safety laws and regulations which may require us to change our operations, potentially resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. These laws can give rise to liability for administrative oversight costs, cleanup costs, property damage, bodily injury, fines and penalties. Capital and operating expenses needed to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties, third-party damages, suspension of production or a cessation of our operations.\nContamination at properties we own or operate, properties we formerly owned or operated or to which hazardous substances were sent by us, may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, which can impose liability for the full amount of remediation-related costs without regard to fault, for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, for building contamination and impacts to human health and for damages to natural resources. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results. We may face unexpected delays in obtaining required permits and approvals that could require significant time and financial resources and delay our ability to operate these facilities, which would adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur electrified powertrain solutions are facing competition from original equipment manufacturers and other providers of electrification solutions that have entered the commercial vehicle electrification market.\nThe vehicle electrification market has expanded significantly since we were founded in 2009. We are facing increasing competition in the commercial vehicle electrification market from leading OEMs in addition to companies such as Hyliion, Workhorse Group Inc. (\u201cWorkhorse\u201d), Nikola and Lordstown. Because we source all of our components from third party suppliers, some of which under non-exclusive contracts, it is possible that competitors may enter the market in the future. If these companies or other OEMs or providers of electrification solutions continue to expand into the commercial markets, we will face increased direct competition, which could have a material adverse effect on our product prices, market share, revenue and profitability.\nThe performance characteristics of our electrified powertrain solutions, including fuel economy and emissions levels, may vary, including due to factors outside of our control.\nThe performance characteristics of our electrified powertrain solutions may vary due to factors outside of our control. For instance, the estimated fuel savings and fuel economy of vehicles installed with our electrified powertrain solutions may vary depending on factors including, but not limited to, drive cycle, speed, terrain, hardware efficiency, payload, vehicle and weather conditions. In addition, greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions of vehicles installed with our electrified powertrain solutions may also vary due to external factors, including the type of fuel, drive cycle, the efficiency and certification of the engine and where the engine is being operated. Additionally, the total emissions generated is subject to how the electricity used to charge our plug in products is generated, which is also outside of our control. These external factors, as well as any operation of our electrified powertrain solutions other than as intended, may result in emissions levels or fuel consumption that are greater than we expect. Due to these factors, there can be no guarantee that the operators of vehicles using our electrified powertrain solutions will realize the expected fuel savings and fuel economy and GHG emission reductions.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which, if not corrected, could affect the reliability of our consolidated financial statements and have other adverse consequences.\nPrior to becoming a public company, we had not been required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting nor had management been required to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls and our auditors had not been required to opine on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Similarly, we had not been subject to the SEC\u2019s internal control reporting requirements. Following the Business Combination in December 2020, we became subject to these requirements. As of December 31, 2020, we had identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. These material weaknesses related to the accounting for equity instruments, insufficient technical accounting resources and lack of segregation of duties. During 2021, we took steps to remediate these weaknesses through, among other things, (1) the hiring of a Chief Financial Officer; (2) the hiring of a Certified Public Accountant as the controller who had experience with public company reporting and technical accounting; (3) the hiring of a Senior Director of SOX Compliance with experience in internal control environments and design; (4) hiring third party professionals to perform a comprehensive assessment of the Company\u2019s internal controls, including design and gap assessments; and (5) the hiring of additional finance personnel to enable processes with appropriate segregation of duties.\nIn the course of preparing the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, we identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, which relate to the ineffective design and implementation of Information Technology General Controls (\u201cITGC\u201d) as well as the lack of properly designed management review controls to compensate for these deficiencies. The Company\u2019s ITGC deficiencies included improperly designed controls pertaining to user access rights and segregation of duties over systems that are critical to the Company\u2019s system of financial reporting. The Company\u2019s management review controls include the review and approval of journal entries, account reconciliations, accounting estimates, and other technical accounting matters. The Company did not maintain sufficient evidence of these review control activities. The ITGC deficiencies, combined with a lack of properly designed and implemented management review controls to compensate for these deficiencies, represent material weaknesses in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement with respect to the Company\u2019s significant accounts and disclosures will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. These deficiencies could result in misstatements to our financial statements that would be material and would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nOur management is in the process of developing a remediation plan. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until management designs and implements effective controls that operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. Our management will monitor the effectiveness of our remediation plans and will make changes management determines to be appropriate.\nIf not remediated, these material weaknesses could result in material misstatements to our annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, or in delayed filing of required periodic reports. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or when required in the future, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our Common Stock could be adversely affected and we could become subject to litigation or investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nIncreased warranty claims could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nAs our business expands the sale of our electrified powertrain solutions, we will need to increase warranty reserves to cover warranty-related claims. If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our vehicles, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. We may become subject to significant and unexpected warranty expenses as well as claims from our customers, including loss of revenue or damages. There can be no assurances that then-existing warranty reserves will be sufficient to cover all claims.\nInability to leverage vehicle and customer data could impact our software algorithms and impact research and development operations.\nWe rely on data collected from the use of fleet vehicles outfitted with our products, including vehicle data and data related to battery usage statistics. We use this data in connection with our software algorithms and the research, development and analysis of our products. Our inability to obtain this data or the necessary rights to use this data could result in delays or otherwise negatively impact our research and development efforts.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could impact our ability to effectively provide our services.\nWe plan to include in-vehicle services and functionality that utilize data connectivity to monitor performance and timely capture opportunities to enhance over-the-road performance for cost-saving preventative maintenance. The availability and effectiveness of our services depend on the continued operation of information technology and communications systems. Our systems will be vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among others, physical theft, fire, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, power loss, war, telecommunications failures, viruses, denial or degradation of service attacks, ransomware, social engineering schemes, insider theft or misuse or other attempts to harm our systems. We utilize reputable third-party service providers or vendors for all of our data other than our source code, and these providers could also be vulnerable to harms similar to those that could damage our systems, including sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism causing potential disruptions. Some of our systems will not be fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. Any problems with our third-party cloud hosting providers could result in lengthy interruptions in our data services. In addition, our in-vehicle services and functionality are highly technical and complex technology which may contain errors or vulnerabilities that could result in interruptions in our business or the failure of our systems.\nOur electrified powertrain solutions rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and if these systems contain errors, bugs or vulnerabilities, or if we are unsuccessful in addressing or mitigating technical limitations in our systems, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur electrified powertrain solutions rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or maintained internally or by third parties, that is highly technical and complex and will require modification and updates over the life of the vehicle. In addition, our electrified powertrain solutions depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve, process and manage immense amounts of data. Our software and hardware may contain errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design defects or technical limitations, and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives. Some errors, bugs or vulnerabilities within our software or hardware may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not resolve issues to the satisfaction of our customers. Additionally, even if we are able to deploy updates to the software addressing any issues, our over-the-air update procedures may fail to properly update the software. In such an instance, affected vehicles would need to be brought to an upfitter or to one of our service team members for updates to be installed, and the software would remain subject to vulnerabilities until such time as the updates are installed. If we are unable to prevent or effectively remedy errors, bugs, vulnerabilities or defects in our software and hardware, we may suffer damage to our reputation, loss of customers, loss of revenue or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIf our electrified powertrain solutions fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our electrified powertrain solutions could be harmed.\nOur electrified powertrain solutions may contain defects in design and production that may cause them not to perform as expected or may require repair. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our electrified powertrain solutions. We may experience recalls in the future, which could adversely affect our brand and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our electrified powertrain solutions may not perform consistent with customers\u2019 expectations or consistent with other vehicles which may become available or are consistent with other vehicles which may become available. Any product defects or any other failure of our electrified powertrain solutions and software to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in adverse publicity, lost revenue, delivery delays, product recalls, negative publicity, product liability claims and significant warranty and other expenses and could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, problems and defects experienced by other electrified powertrain fleet solutions could by association have a negative impact on perception and customer demand for our electrified powertrain solutions.\nDevelopments in alternative technology or improvements in the internal combustion engine may adversely affect the demand for our electrified powertrain solutions.\nSignificant developments in alternative technologies, such as battery cell technology, advanced diesel, ethanol or natural gas, or improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine, may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results in ways we do not currently anticipate. Existing and other battery cell technologies, fuels or sources of energy may emerge as customers\u2019 preferred alternative to our electrified powertrain solutions. Any failure by us to develop new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could materially delay our development and introduction of new electrified powertrain solutions, which could result in the loss of competitiveness, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors. Our research and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in alternate technology. As technologies change, we plan to upgrade or adapt our electrified powertrain solutions with the latest technology, in particular battery cell technology. However, our electrified powertrain solutions may not compete effectively with alternative systems if we are not able to source and integrate the latest technology into our electrified powertrain solutions.\nOur assumptions regarding the ability of our electrified powertrain solutions to limit carbon intensity and reduce GHG emissions and contribute to global decarbonization may be inaccurate.\nWe believe that our electrified powertrain solutions, to the extent adopted, may have the ability to limit carbon intensity and reduce GHG emissions from fleet operations; however, these beliefs are based on certain assumptions, including, but not limited to, our projections of the fuel types used, drive cycle and our electrified powertrain solutions\u2019 efficiencies and performance. To the extent our assumptions are materially incorrect or incomplete, it could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. In addition, if our assumptions regarding the ability of our solutions to limit carbon intensity and reduce GHG emissions from trucking operations are materially incorrect or incomplete, or if our beliefs regarding the availability of our products are materially incorrect or incomplete, it is possible that our competitors\u2019 technology may be better at limiting carbon intensity and reducing GHG emissions in certain circumstances and in certain markets.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we are incurring and expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, and these expenses may increase even more after we are no longer an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the SEC and the NYSE. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, we expect these rules and regulations to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. The increased costs will increase our net loss. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board advisors or as executive officers.\nOur management has limited experience in operating a public company.\nOur executive officers have limited experience in the management of a publicly traded company. Our management team may not successfully or effectively manage our transition to a public company that will be subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under federal securities laws. Their limited experience in dealing with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies could be a significant disadvantage in that it is likely that an increasing amount of their time may be devoted to these activities, which will result in less time being devoted to the management and growth of the post-combination company. We may not have adequate personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in the accounting policies, practices or internal control over financial reporting required of public companies in the U.S. The development and implementation of the standards and controls necessary for us to achieve the level of accounting standards required of a public company in the U.S. may require costs greater than expected. It is possible that we will be required to expand our employee base and hire additional employees to support our operations as a public company, which will increase our operating costs in future periods.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nThe U.S. government has adopted a new approach to trade policy and in some cases has attempted to renegotiate or terminate certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements. It has also imposed tariffs on certain foreign goods, including steel and certain commercial vehicle parts, which have begun to result in increased costs for goods imported into the U.S. If we are unable to pass price increases on to our customer base or otherwise mitigate the costs, or if demand for our exported products decreases due to the higher cost, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. In addition, further tariffs have been proposed by the U.S. and our trading partners and additional trade restrictions could be implemented on a broader range of products or raw materials. The resulting environment of retaliatory trade or other practices could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, customers, suppliers and the global economy.\nWe are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. We could face criminal liability and other serious consequences for violations, which could harm our business.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct or will conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors and other collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, agents, contractors and other collaborators, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm and other consequences.\nRegulatory requirements may have a negative effect upon our business.\nAll vehicles sold must comply with international, federal, and state motor vehicle safety standards. In the United States, vehicles that meet or exceed all federally mandated safety standards are certified under the federal regulations. Rigorous testing and the use of approved materials and equipment are among the requirements for achieving federal certification. Our products may be subject to substantial regulation under federal, state, and local laws and standards. These regulations include those promulgated by the U.S. EPA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and various state boards, and compliance certification is required for each new model year. These laws and standards are subject to change from time to time and we could become subject to these regulations in the future. In addition, federal, state, and local laws and industrial standards for electric vehicles are still developing. Compliance with these regulations could be challenging, burdensome, time consuming, and expensive. If compliance results in delays or substantial expenses, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nUnfavorable publicity, or a failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nAs an early stage company, maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract and retain employees, partners, customers and investors, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation and government investigations.\nRecent significant negative publicity has adversely affected our brand and reputation and our stock price. Negative publicity may result from allegations of fraud, improper business practices, employee misconduct or any other matters that could give rise to litigation and/or governmental investigations. Unfavorable publicity relating to us or those affiliated with us has and may in the future adversely affect public perception of the entire company. Adverse publicity and its effect on overall public perceptions of our brand, or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn March 2021, an entity published an article containing certain allegations against us. This article and the public response to such article, as well as other negative publicity, have adversely affected our brand and reputation as well as our stock price, which makes it difficult for us to attract and retain employees, partners and customers, reduces confidence in our products and services, harms investor confidence and the market price of our securities, invites legislative and regulatory scrutiny and has resulted in various legal proceedings. As a result, customers, potential customers, partners and potential partners may in the future fail to award us additional business or cancel or seek to cancel existing contracts or otherwise, direct future business to our competitors, and investors may invest in our competitors instead.\nWe have been named a defendant in stockholder class actions, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has sent us requests for information, including a subpoena for documents. These, and potential similar or related lawsuits or investigations, could result in substantial legal fees, fines, penalties or damages and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our business.\nBeginning on March 8, 2021, two putative class action complaints were filed in the federal district court for the Southern District of New York against us and certain of our current officers and directors. The cases were consolidated as In re XL Fleet Corp. Securities Litigation, Case No. 1:21-cv-02171, a lead plaintiff was appointed, and an amended consolidated complaint was filed on July 20, 2021. The amended complaint alleges that certain public statements made by the defendants between September 18, 2020 and March 31, 2021 violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Our motion to dismiss the amended complaint was denied on February 17, 2022. We believe that the allegations asserted in the securities class action are without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful. At this time, we are unable to estimate potential losses, if any, related to the lawsuit.\nOn September 20, 2021, and October 19, 2021, two class action complaints were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against certain of our current officers and directors, and the company\u2019s sponsor, Pivotal Investment Holdings II LLC. The actions were consolidated and a consolidated amended complaint was filed on January 31, 2022, alleging various breaches of fiduciary duty, and aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty, for purported actions relating to the negotiation and approval of the December 21, 2020 merger and organization of Legacy XL to become XL Fleet Corp., and purportedly materially misleading statements made in connection with the merger. We believe that the allegations asserted in the action are without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit.\nThe Company has received requests for information, including a subpoena, from the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) related to, among other things, the Company\u2019s business combination with XL Hybrids, Inc. and the related PIPE financing, the Company\u2019s sales pipeline and revenue projections, purchase orders, suppliers, CARB approvals, fuel economy from our Power Drive products, customer complaints, and disclosures and other matters in connection with the foregoing. According to the subpoena, the investigation is a fact-finding inquiry and does not mean that the SEC has concluded that there is a violation of the law. We intend to provide the requested information and cooperate fully with the SEC investigation.\nThese legal proceedings and any other similar or related legal proceedings or investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the actual costs to be incurred relating to these matters will depend upon many unknown factors. The outcome of these legal proceedings is uncertain, and we could be forced to expend significant resources in the defense of these actions, and we may not prevail. Monitoring and defending against legal actions is time-consuming for our management and detracts from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities, which could result in delays of our testing or our development and commercialization efforts. In addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with these matters. We are also generally obligated, to the extent permitted by law, to indemnify our current and former directors and officers who are named as defendants in these and similar actions. We are not currently able to estimate the possible cost to us from these matters, as these actions are currently at an early stage and we cannot be certain how long it may take to resolve these matters or the possible amount of any damages that we may be required to pay. It is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. Decisions adverse to our interests in these actions could result in the payment of substantial damages, or possibly fines, and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial position. In addition, the uncertainty of the currently pending litigation could lead to increased volatility in our stock price.\nWe may need to defend ourselves against patent, copyright or trademark infringement claims or trade secret misappropriation claims, which may be time-consuming and cause us to incur substantial costs.\nCompanies, organizations or individuals, including our competitors, may own or obtain patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights that would prevent or limit our ability to make, use, develop or sell our electrified powertrain solutions, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. We may receive inquiries from patent, copyright or trademark owners inquiring whether we infringe upon their proprietary rights. We may also be the subject of allegations that we have misappropriated their trade secrets or other proprietary rights. Companies owning patents or other intellectual property rights relating to battery packs, electric motors, or electronic power management systems may allege infringement or misappropriation of such rights. In response to a determination that we have infringed upon or misappropriated a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may be required to do one or more of the following:\n\u25cf cease development, sales or use of our products that incorporate the asserted intellectual property;\n\u25cf pay substantial damages;\n\u25cf obtain a license from the owner of the asserted intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; or\n\u25cf redesign one or more aspects or systems of our electrified powertrain solutions.\nA successful claim of infringement or misappropriation against us could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Any litigation or claims, whether valid or invalid, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. For example, we purchase many of the components for our hybrid systems from third party manufacturers and may not be able to prevent competitors from using these third party components. Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we will rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets (including know-how), employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, copyrights, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our rights in our technology.\nThe protection of our intellectual property rights will be important to our future business opportunities. However, the measures we take to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use by others may not be effective for various reasons, including the following:\n\u25cf any patent applications that we submit may not result in the issuance of patents;\n\u25cf the scope of our issued patents, including our patent claims, may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary rights;\n\u25cf our issued patents may be challenged or invalidated by our competitors;\n\u25cf our employees or business partners may breach their confidentiality, non-disclosure and non-use obligations to us;\n\u25cf third-parties may independently develop technologies that are the same or similar to ours;\n\u25cf the costs associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or other intellectual property rights may make enforcement impracticable; and\n\u25cf current and future competitors may circumvent our intellectual property.\nPatent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws vary throughout the world. Some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Further, policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions may be difficult. Therefore, our intellectual property rights may not be as strong or as easily enforced outside of the U.S.\nAlso, while we have registered trademarks in an effort to protect our investment in our brand and goodwill with customers, competitors may challenge the validity of those trademarks and other brand names in which we have invested. Such challenges can be expensive and may adversely affect our ability to maintain the goodwill gained in connection with a particular trademark.\nOur intellectual property applications for registration may not issue or be registered, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting products similar to ours.\nWe cannot be certain that we are the first inventor of the subject matter to which we have filed a particular patent application, or if we are the first party to file such a patent application. If another party has filed a patent application to the same subject matter as we have, we may not be entitled to the protection sought by the patent application. We also cannot be certain whether the claims included in a patent application will ultimately be allowed in the applicable issued patent. Further, the scope of protection of issued patent claims is often difficult to determine. As a result, we cannot be certain that the patent applications that we file will issue, or that issued patents will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. In addition, our competitors may design around issued patents, which may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nChanges in tax laws may materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, U.S. federal tax legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), enacted many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws. Future guidance from the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) with respect to the Tax Act may affect our, and certain aspects of the Tax Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) has already modified certain provisions of the Tax Act. In addition, we are uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act, the CARES Act or any newly enacted federal tax legislation.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited in connection with the Business Combination or other ownership changes.\nWe have incurred losses during our history and do not expect to become profitable in the near future, and may never achieve profitability. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire, if at all. As of December 31, 2021, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $128.2 million and $75.0 million, respectively.\nUnder the Tax Act, as modified by the CARES Act, U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in taxable periods beginning after December 31, 2017, may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such net operating loss carryforwards in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, is limited to 80% of taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act or the CARES Act.\nIn addition, our net operating loss carryforwards are subject to review and possible adjustment by the IRS and state tax authorities. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), our federal net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may become subject to an annual limitation in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership of the Company. An \u201cownership change\u201d pursuant to Section 382 of the Code generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of a company\u2019s stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities may be limited as a result of ownership changes, including potential changes in connection with the reverse recapitalization or other transactions. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We have not yet determined the amount of the cumulative change in our ownership resulting from the reverse recapitalization or other transactions, or any resulting limitations on our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. If we earn taxable income, such limitations could result in increased future income tax liability to us and our future cash flows could be adversely affected. We have recorded a full valuation allowance related to our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the future benefits of those assets.\nWe may not be able to obtain or agree on acceptable terms and conditions for all or a significant portion of the government grants, loans and other incentives for which we may apply. As a result, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe have previously applied and may again in the future apply for federal and state grants, loans and tax incentives under government programs designed to stimulate the economy and support the production of alternative fuel and electric vehicles and related technologies. We anticipate that in the future there will be new opportunities for us to apply for grants, loans and other incentives from federal, state and foreign governments. Our ability to obtain funds or incentives from government sources is subject to the availability of funds under applicable government programs and approval of our applications to participate in such programs. The application process for these funds and other incentives will likely be highly competitive. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining any of these additional grants, loans and other incentives.\nOur product development efforts are subject to counterparty risks\nWe often develop products as part of co-development agreements where our counterparty bears some of the product development and engineering costs and, among other obligations, may be responsible for supplying critical components or designs, providing access to key customers or technologies, or developing the more fulsome product or platform (a chassis or vehicle, for example) that incorporates or makes use of our products. In some instances, we\u2019ve made investments in those counterparties to provide them with additional working capital and provide us with greater returns upon the expected commercial success of the integrated product offering. Among other initiatives, we are currently developing an electric drivetrain for use in Curbtender medium duty refuse vehicles. Our reliance on these and other counterparties subjects our product development efforts, the expected commercial success of those products, and any investment we\u2019ve made in those counterparties to the risks facing those businesses, including their own financial wellbeing and liquidity, the effectiveness of their salesforce, the quality of their customer relationships, the stability of their workforce, the capability of their engineering teams, the adequacy of their own technology and manufacturing ability, and other risks that may be unforeseeable from the perspective of a co-developer. Should these businesses and/or product offerings fail to achieve the commercial success we anticipate, our own revenues may be impacted and our investments may be impaired.\nOur XL Grid business depends in part on support from gas and electric utilities for energy efficiency, and a decline in such support could harm our business.\nOur XL Grid energy efficiency services business depends in large part on government legislation and policies that support energy efficiency projects and that enhance the economic feasibility of our energy efficiency services for customers. Several of the states in which we operate support our customers\u2019 investments in energy efficiency through legislation and regulations that provide financial incentives for customers to procure our energy efficiency services.\nOur customers frequently depend on these programs to help justify the costs associated with, and to finance energy efficiency projects. If any of these incentives are adversely amended, eliminated or not extended beyond their current expiration dates, or if funding for these incentives is reduced, it could adversely affect our ability to complete projects for our existing customers and obtain project commitments from new customers.\nFailure of our subcontractors to properly perform their services in a timely manner could cause delays in the delivery of our XL Gird energy efficiency projects which could damage our reputation, have a negative impact on our relationships with our customers and adversely affect our growth.\nOur success depends on our ability to provide quality, reliable energy efficiency services in a timely manner, which in part requires the proper removal and installation of lighting, mechanical and electrical systems by our subcontractors upon which we depend. Substantially all of our energy efficiency solutions are installed by subcontractors. Any delays, malfunctions, inefficiencies or interruptions in our energy efficiency services caused by improper installation by our subcontractors could cause us to have difficulty retaining current customers and attracting new customers. Such delays could also result in additional costs that could affect the profit margin of our projects. In addition, our brand, reputation and growth could be negatively impacted.\nOur XL Grid energy efficiency activities and operations are subject to numerous health and safety laws and regulations, and if we violate such regulations, we could face penalties and fines.\nWe are subject to numerous health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain permits and approvals and implement health and safety programs and procedures to control risks associated with our energy efficiency projects. If our compliance programs are not successful, we could be subject to penalties or to revocation of our permits, which may require us to curtail or cease operations of the affected projects. Violations of laws, regulations and permit requirements may also result in criminal sanctions or injunctions.\nOur costs of complying with current and future health and safety laws, regulations and permit requirements, and any liabilities, fines or other sanctions resulting from violations of them, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur XL Grid energy efficiency retrofitting process often involves responsibility for the removal and disposal of components containing hazardous materials and at times requires that our subcontractors work in hazardous conditions, either of which could give rise to a claim against us.\nWhen we retrofit a customer\u2019s facility, we typically assume responsibility for removing and disposing of its existing lighting fixtures. Certain components of these fixtures contain trace amounts of mercury and other hazardous materials. Older components may also contain trace amounts of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. We utilize licensed and insured hazardous wastes disposal companies to remove and/or dispose of such components. Failure to properly handle, remove or dispose of the components containing these hazardous materials in a safe, effective and lawful manner could give rise to liability for us, or could expose our workers or other persons to these hazardous materials, which could result in claims against us. A successful personal injury claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our available insurance limits could require us to make significant payments of damages and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nConcentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, directors and their respective affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nOur executive officers, directors and their respective affiliates as a group beneficially own approximately 13.2% of our outstanding Common Stock. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation (\u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d) and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of their shares after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nThe price of our Common Stock may be volatile.\nThe price of our Common Stock may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results and those of other public companies in industry;\n\u25cf mergers and strategic alliances in the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf market prices and conditions in the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf changes in government regulation;\n\u25cf potential or actual military conflicts or acts of terrorism;\n\u25cf announcements concerning us or our competitors;\n\u25cf the general state of the securities markets;\n\u25cf threatened or actual lawsuits, investigations or other legal proceedings; and\n\u25cf short-selling activity related to our Common Stock.\nThese market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our Common Stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, we believe there has been and may continue to be substantial trading in derivatives of our Common Stock, including short selling activity or related similar activities, which are beyond our control and which may be beyond the full control of the SEC and Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority or \u201cFINRA\u201d. While the SEC and FINRA rules prohibit some forms of short selling and other activities that may result in stock price manipulation, such activity may nonetheless occur without detection or enforcement. There can be no assurance that should there be any illegal manipulation in the trading of our stock, it will be detected, prosecuted or successfully eradicated. Significant short selling market manipulation could cause our Common Stock trading price to decline, to become more volatile, or both.\nReports published by analysts, including projections in those reports that differ from our actual results, could adversely affect the price and trading volume of our Common Stock.\nWe expect that securities research analysts will establish and publish their own periodic projections for our business. These projections may vary widely and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our stock price may decline if our actual results do not match the projections of these securities research analysts. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who write reports on us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our stock price or trading volume could decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our Common Stock adversely, the price and trading volume of our Common Stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our Common Stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease their coverage or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe may issue additional Common Stock or preferred stock, including under our equity incentive plan. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our stockholders and likely present other risks.\nWe may issue a substantial number of additional shares of common or preferred stock, including under our equity incentive plan. Any such issuances of additional shares of common or preferred stock:\n\u25cf may significantly dilute the equity interests of our investors;\n\u25cf may subordinate the rights of holders of Common Stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our Common Stock;\n\u25cf could cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\n\u25cf may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Common Stock.\nWe may issue additional shares of Common Stock or other equity securities without stockholder approval, which will dilute existing stockholders\u2019 interests and may depress the market price of our Common Stock.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have options, RSUs and warrants outstanding to purchase up to an aggregate of 14,583,380 shares of our Common Stock, including, Private Placement Warrants to purchase 4,233,333 shares and options, RSUs and warrants to purchase up to 10,350,047 shares. We also had the ability to initially issue up to 11,003,180 shares of Common Stock under the XL Fleet Corp. 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2020 Plan\u201d). Pursuant to the 2020 Plan, the number of shares available for issuance automatically increases annually on the first day of each fiscal year during the period beginning with the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year during which the 2020 Plan is first approved by the our stockholders, and ending on the second day of fiscal year 2030, in an amount equal to the lesser of: (a) 5% of the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock on such date; and (b) an amount determined by the plan administrator. We may issue additional shares of Common Stock or other equity securities of equal or senior rank in the future in connection with, among other things, future acquisitions or repayment of outstanding indebtedness, without stockholder approval, in a number of circumstances.\nOur issuance of additional shares of Common Stock or other equity securities of equal or senior rank would have the following effects:\n\u25cf our existing stockholders\u2019 proportionate ownership interest in our will decrease;\n\u25cf the amount of cash available per share, including for payment of dividends (if any) in the future, may decrease;\n\u25cf the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding share of Common Stock may be diminished; and\n\u25cf the market price of our shares of Common Stock may decline.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nRecent management changes could disrupt our operations and impair our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nWe have experienced recent changes to our senior management team, including the announced departure of Dimitri Kazarinoff effective December 1, 2021 and appointment of Eric Tech as our Chief Executive Officer effective as of December 1, 2021. In addition, the Company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Cielo Hernandez, resigned as of January 31, 2022. Changes in our senior management and uncertainty regarding pending changes may disrupt our operations, impact partner relationships, and impair our ability to recruit and retain other needed personnel. Any such disruption or impairment could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur warrants are accounted for as liabilities and the changes in value of our warrants could have a material effect on our financial results.\nOn April 12, 2021, the Acting Director of the Division of Corporation Finance and Acting Chief Accountant of the SEC together issued a statement regarding the accounting and reporting considerations for warrants issued by special purpose acquisition companies entitled \u201cStaff Statement on Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants Issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (\u201cSPACs\u201d)\u201d (the \u201cSEC Statement\u201d). Specifically, the SEC Statement focused on certain settlement terms and provisions related to certain tender offers, which terms are similar to those contained in the warrant agreement governing our warrants. As a result of the SEC Statement, we reevaluated the accounting treatment of our 7,666,667 public warrants and 4,233,333 private placement warrants, and determined to classify the warrants as derivative liabilities measured at fair value, with changes in fair value each period reported in earnings.\nAs a result, included on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 contained elsewhere in this Annual Report are derivative liabilities related to embedded features contained within our private warrants. There are no public warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Accounting Standards Codification 815, Derivatives and Hedging (\u201cASC 815\u201d), provides for the remeasurement of the fair value of such derivatives at each balance sheet date, with a resulting non-cash gain or loss related to the change in the fair value being recognized in earnings in the statement of operations. As a result of the recurring fair value measurement, our consolidated financial statements and results of operations may fluctuate quarterly, based on factors which are outside of our control. Due to the recurring fair value measurement, we expect that we will recognize non-cash gains or losses on our warrants each reporting period and that the amount of such gains or losses could be material.\nAs discussed under \u201cRisks Related to Owning Our Securities - The Price of our Common Stock may be volatile,\u201d the price of our Common Stock may fluctuate. The volatility of the Common Stock directly impacts the fair value of the Warrants; hence, continued volatility in the price of our Common Stock could result in a corresponding volatility in the fair value of the liability associated with the Warrants.\nOur charter contains anti-takeover provisions that could adversely affect the rights of our stockholders.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation contains provisions to limit the ability of others to acquire control of our or cause us to engage in change-of-control transactions, including, among other things:\n\u25cf provisions that authorize our board of directors, without action by our stockholders, to issue additional shares of Common Stock and preferred stock with preferential rights determined by our board of directors;\n\u25cf provisions that permit only a majority of our board of directors to call stockholder meetings and therefore do not permit stockholders to call stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf provisions that impose advance notice requirements, minimum shareholding periods and ownership thresholds, and other requirements and limitations on the ability of stockholders to propose matters for consideration at stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf provisions limiting stockholders\u2019 ability to act by written consent; and\n\u25cf a staggered board whereby our directors are divided into three classes, with each class subject to retirement and re-election once every three years on a rotating basis.\nThese provisions could have the effect of depriving our stockholders of an opportunity to sell their Common Stock at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of our company in a tender offer or similar transaction. With our staggered board of directors, at least two annual or special meetings of stockholders will generally be required in order to effect a change in a majority of our directors. Our staggered board of directors can discourage proxy contests for the election of our directors and purchases of substantial blocks of our shares by making it more difficult for a potential acquirer to gain control of our board of directors in a relatively short period of time.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware and, if brought outside of Delaware, the stockholder bringing the suit will be deemed to have consented to service of process on such stockholder\u2019s counsel except any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, or (D) any action arising under the Securities Act, as to which the Court of Chancery and the federal district court for the District of Delaware shall have concurrent jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that we find favorable for disputes with our or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. We cannot be certain that a court will decide that this provision is either applicable or enforceable, and if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, our may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that the exclusive forum provision will be applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nWe may become involved in legal proceedings and other matters that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could adversely affect our financial results.\nFrom time to time, we may be named in lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to our business. In particular, the nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers, stockholders, competitors, business partners and others in the ordinary course of business.\nAs with all legal proceedings, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of these matters. Moreover, legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be successful in defending or prosecuting these lawsuits, which could result in settlements or damages that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur employees and independent contractors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees and independent contractors may engage in misconduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or other activities that violate laws and regulations, including production standards, U.S. federal and state fraud, abuse, data privacy and security laws, other similar non-U.S. laws or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. In addition, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results, including, without limitation, the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance, imprisonment, other sanctions, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nOur failure to timely and effectively implement controls and procedures required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d), which requires, among other things, that companies maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure timely disclosure of material information, and that management review the effectiveness of those controls on a quarterly basis. Because we ceased to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d) with our transition to large accelerated filer status as of December 31, 2021, we are also now subject to Section 404(b) of SOX, which requires that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the first time in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, among other additional requirements. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to help prevent fraud, and our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance requirements. These rules and regulations also increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nIndustry disruptions and changes in practice could impact our operating results.\nA work stoppage or slowdown, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, at one or more of our or our outsourcing partners\u2019, suppliers and vehicle OEMs has occurred in the past due to the COVID-19 pandemic and could again in the future have a material adverse effect on our business. The Company expects to continue to experience production line shutdowns / slowdowns at vehicle OEMs, and some of our customers will not purchase our electric propulsion systems without OEM vehicle chassis on which to install those systems. Also, a significant disruption in the supply of a key component due to a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business. We also believe that the impact of the global microchip shortage that the entire industry is currently experiencing will adversely impact our operating results in fiscal year 2022. Lastly, Ford\u2019s recent cancellation of the eQVM program industry wide is adversely impacting upfitter partners\u2019 ability and willingness to install ours systems. This will continue to have an adverse impact on our operating results in fiscal year 2022.\nOur business and operations could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities litigation or shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of business and growth strategy and impact the price of our Common Stock.\nShareholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing recently. Volatility in the price of our Common Stock or other reasons may in the future cause us to become the target of securities litigation or shareholder activism. Securities litigation and shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s and our board of director\u2019s attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such securities litigation and shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, we may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to any securities litigation and shareholder activism. Further, the price of our Common Stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any securities litigation and shareholder activism.\nOur financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors.\nWe expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our operating costs, which we anticipate will fluctuate with the pace at which we continue to design, develop and produce new products and increase production capacity. Additionally, our revenues from period to period may fluctuate as we introduce existing products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and introduce new products. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our financial results, especially in the short term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, our financial results may not meet the expectations of equity research analysts, ratings agencies or investors, who may be focused only on quarterly financial results. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our Common Stock could fall substantially, either suddenly or over time.\nWe intend to pursue acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and dispositions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur growth strategy includes the acquisition of, and investment in, businesses that offer complementary products, services and technologies, augment our market coverage, or enhance our technological capabilities, such as our recent acquisition of World Energy Efficiency Services, LLC, or World Energy. We may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition, investment, alliance, or joint venture opportunities, or to consummate any such transactions. In addition, our original estimates and assumptions used in assessing any transaction may be inaccurate and we may not realize the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such transaction, including our recent acquisition of World Energy.\nAny future growth through acquisitions will depend in part upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at attractive prices, terms and conditions, as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions. We may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions, which could increase the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt. Acquisitions involve risks that business judgments made concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired may prove to be incorrect. Future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transaction-related expenses, which could include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others.\nWe may experience, challenges in integrating operations and information technology systems acquired from other companies. This could result in the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or clients or those of the acquired operations. The integration process itself may be costly and may adversely impact our business and the acquired company\u2019s business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of accounting and information technology systems.\nWe complete acquisitions with the expectation that they will result in various benefits, but the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions are subject to a number of uncertainties, including the ability to timely realize accretive benefits, the level of attrition from professionals licensed or associated with the acquired companies and whether we can successfully integrate the acquired business. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could in turn materially and adversely affect our overall business, financial condition and operating results.", "PERMNO": 18936, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "PIC"}
