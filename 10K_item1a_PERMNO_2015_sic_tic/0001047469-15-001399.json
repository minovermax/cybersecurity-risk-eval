RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties and other important factors described below in addition to other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before purchasing our stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe have incurred a cumulative loss since inception. If we do not generate significant revenue, we may not return to profitability.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception in May 2001. At December 31, 2014, our accumulated deficit was $369.1 million. We may incur annual operating losses over the next several years as we expand our drug commercialization, development and discovery efforts. In addition, we must successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates, and effectively manufacture, market and sell any drugs we successfully develop. Accordingly, we may not generate significant revenue in the longer term and, even if we do generate significant revenue, we may never achieve long-term profitability.\nTo be profitable, we and our collaborative partners must succeed in developing and commercializing drugs with significant market potential. This will require us and our collaborative partners to be successful in a range of challenging activities: developing product candidates; obtaining regulatory approval for product candidates through either existing or new regulatory approval pathways; clearing allegedly infringing patent rights; enforcing our patent rights; and manufacturing, distributing, marketing and selling products. Our potential profitability will also be adversely impacted by the entry of competitive products and, if so, the degree of the impact could be affected by whether the entry is before or after the launch of our products. We may never succeed in these activities and may never generate revenues that are significant.\nEven if M356 is approved by the FDA, if Teva is successful in the ongoing Copaxone patent litigation by enjoining the manufacture or sale of M356 by Sandoz or in otherwise asserting its alleged patent rights relating to the manufacturing and sale of Copaxone, we and Sandoz may not be able to launch M356 until September 2015, or we may have to pay significant damages if we launch before September 2015.\nIn July 2012, the United States Federal District Court in the Southern District of New York (the \"District Court\") issued a final order and permanent injunction prohibiting Sandoz and Mylan from infringing all of the patents in the suit. See Part I, Item 3 \"Legal Proceedings\" below in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Orange Book-listed patents and one non-Orange Book-listed patent expired on May 24, 2014, however one non-Orange Book-listed patent does not expire until September 1, 2015. In July 2012, we appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or CAFC, and in July 2013, the CAFC issued a written opinion invalidating several of the nine patents, including the one patent set to expire in September 2015. Teva appealed the CAFC decision to the Supreme Court of the United States, which in January 2015, vacated the CAFC's 2013 decision and remanded the case to the CAFC to reconsider and rule on the validity of the patent.\nShould Teva succeed in the District Court, or succeed in a similar request at the CAFC, the launch of M356, if approved, may not occur until the earlier of a finding of invalidity at the CAFC on remand or September 2015, which would impair our ability to commercialize M356 and harm our business and financial condition. Furthermore, if M356 is approved by the FDA prior to a decision in the patent case, and we and Sandoz launch prior to such decision, and Teva is ultimately successful, we and Sandoz may be liable for significant damages and our business and financial condition would be materially harmed. The possibility of incurring liability for such damages may reduce the scope of, or\nmay delay, any launch of M356 prior to resolution of the patent litigation. In addition, we may not be able to utilize M356 cash flows to support program investments until the conclusion of the lawsuit, which would limit our ability to invest in ongoing R&D programs or require us to raise capital through equity or debt offerings.\nIf other generic versions of the brand name drugs, or other biosimilars of the reference originator biologics, for which we have products or product candidates, including M356 and M923, are approved and successfully commercialized, our business would suffer.\nGeneric versions of our products contribute most significantly to revenues at the time of their launch, especially with limited competition. As such, the timing of competition can have a significant impact on our financial results. We expect that certain of our product candidates may face intense and increasing competition from other manufacturers of generic and/or branded products. For example, in September 2009, Mylan announced that the FDA had accepted for filing its ANDA for generic Copaxone and in 2011 Synthon announced that it submitted an ANDA to the FDA for a generic Copaxone. Furthermore, as patents for branded products and related exclusivity periods expire, manufacturers of generic products may receive regulatory approval for generic equivalents and may be able to achieve significant market share. As this happens, and as branded manufacturers launch authorized generic versions of such products, market share, revenues and gross profit typically decline, in some cases, dramatically. If any of our generic or biosimilar product offerings, including M356, enter markets with a number of competitors, we may not achieve significant market share, revenues or gross profit. In addition, as other generic products are introduced to the markets in which we participate, the market share, revenues and gross profit of our generic products would likely decline significantly. In addition, the first biosimilar determined to be interchangeable with a particular reference product for any condition of use is eligible for a period of market exclusivity that delays an FDA determination that a second or subsequent biosimilar product is interchangeable with that reference product for any condition of use until the earlier of: (1) one year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable product; (2) 18 months after resolution of a patent infringement suit instituted under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(l)(6) against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product, based on a final court decision regarding all of the patents in the litigation or dismissal of the litigation with or without prejudice; (3) 42 months after approval of the first interchangeable product, if a patent infringement suit instituted under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(l)(6) against the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product is still ongoing; or (4) 18 months after approval of the first interchangeable product if the applicant that submitted the application for the first interchangeable product has not been sued under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(l)(6). A determination that another company's product is interchangeable with HUMIRA or another of the reference brand products for which we have a product candidate prior to approval of M923 or other applicable product candidate may therefore delay the potential determination that our product is interchangeable with the reference product, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations and delay, prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue.\nIf an improved version of a reference brand product, such as Copaxone, is developed that has a new product profile and labeling, the improved version of the product could significantly reduce the market share of the original reference brand product, and may cause a significant decline in sales or potential sales of our generic and biosimilar products.\nBrand companies may develop improved versions of a reference brand product as part of a life cycle extension strategy, and may obtain approval of the improved version under a supplemental new drug application, for a drug, or biologics license application for a biologic. Should the brand company succeed in obtaining an approval of an improved product, it may capture a significant share of the collective reference brand product market and significantly reduce the market for the original reference brand product and thereby the potential size of the market for our generic or biosimilar products. For\nexample, in January 2014, Teva's three-times-a-week formulation of Copaxone received marketing approval by FDA. Teva has reported that over 60% of patients previously using its once-daily formulation have converted to its three-times-weekly formulation. As a result, the market potential for our once-daily formation of M356 has decreased, and may decrease further as additional patients are converted from once-daily Copaxone to three-times-weekly Copaxone. In addition, the improved product may be protected by additional patent rights as well as have the benefit, in the case of drugs, of an additional three years of FDA marketing approval exclusivity, which would prohibit a generic version of the improved product for some period of time. As a result, our business, including our financial results and our ability to fund future discovery and development programs, would suffer.\nIf the market for a reference brand product, such as Copaxone, significantly declines, sales or potential sales of our generic and biosimilars product and product candidates may suffer and our business would be materially impacted.\nCompetition in the biotechnology industry is intense. Brand name products face competition on numerous fronts as technological advances are made or new products are introduced that may offer patients a more convenient form of administration, increased efficacy or improved safety profile. As new products are approved that compete with the reference brand product to our generic product and generic or biosimilar product candidates, such as Copaxone, sales of the reference brand products may be significantly and adversely impacted and may render the reference brand product obsolete.\nCurrent injectable treatments commonly used to treat multiple sclerosis, including Copaxone, are competing with novel therapeutic products, including oral therapies. These oral therapies may offer patients a more convenient form of administration than Copaxone and may provide increased efficacy.\nIf the market for the reference brand product is impacted, we in turn may lose significant market share or market potential for our generic or biosimilar products and product candidates, and the value for our generic or biosimilar pipeline could be negatively impacted. As a result, our business, including our financial results and our ability to fund future discovery and development programs, would suffer.\nTeva may allege that we are infringing existing, additional issued or pending patents they hold. If this occurs we may expend substantial resources in resulting litigation, the outcome of which would be uncertain. Any unfavorable outcome in such litigation could delay our launch of M356, if approved, and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nTeva may assert existing, additional issued or pending patents, and it may claim that we are infringing those patents, including in connection with the on-going Copaxone patent litigation. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses to respond to and litigate these claims. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in litigation, or pending the outcome of litigation or while litigation is pending, a court could issue a temporary injunction or a permanent injunction preventing us from marketing and selling M356. Furthermore, we may be ordered to pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we launch M356 prior to a decision of the patent case and are subsequently found to have willfully infringed Teva's patent rights. Litigation concerning intellectual property and proprietary technologies is widespread and can be protracted and expensive, and can distract management and other key personnel from running our business.\nIf we were unsuccessful in any additional patent suits brought by Teva, we may be unable to effectively market M356, which could limit our ability to generate revenue or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations.\nWe will require substantial funds and may require additional capital to execute our business plan and, if additional capital is not available, we may need to delay, limit or cease our product development efforts or other operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $191.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we had a net loss of $98.6 million and cash used in operating activities of $65.2 million. We will continue to require substantial funds to conduct research and development, process development, manufacturing, nonclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, as well as funds necessary to manufacture and market products that are approved for commercial sale. Because successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require to complete research and development and commercialize our products under development.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022 the level of sales of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection;\n\u2022 our ability to utilize any M356 cash flows, in whole or in part, generated before or after resolution of the Copaxone patent case;\n\u2022 whether a final decision, after appeal, is issued in favor of Teva in its Copaxone-related patent infringement litigation matters against us;\n\u2022 the timing of the approval, launch and commercialization of our product candidates, including M356;\n\u2022 the advancement of our product candidates and other development programs, including the timing and costs of obtaining regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 the advancement of our biosimilar product candidates and receipt of license and milestone payments under our Baxter Agreement;\n\u2022 the timing of FDA approval of the products of our competitors;\n\u2022 the cost of litigation, including with Amphastar and Actavis relating to enoxaparin, that is not otherwise covered by our collaboration agreement, or potential patent litigation with others, as well as any damages, including possibly treble damages, that may be owed to third parties should we be unsuccessful in such litigation;\n\u2022 the ability to enter into additional strategic collaborations for our non-partnered programs, as well as the terms and timing of any milestone, royalty or profit share payments thereunder;\n\u2022 the continued progress in our research and development programs, including completion of our nonclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022 the potential acquisition and in-licensing of other technologies, products or assets; and\n\u2022 the cost of manufacturing, marketing and sales activities, if any.\nWe expect to finance and manage our planned operating and expenditure requirements principally through our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and capital raised through equity financings, including utilization of our At-the-Market facility. We believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements through at least the end of 2015. We may seek additional funding in the future through third-party collaborations and licensing arrangements, public or private debt financings or from other sources. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity may dilute existing investors' percentage ownership of our common stock. Capital raised through debt financing would require us to make periodic interest payments and may impose potentially restrictive covenants on the conduct of our business. Additional funds may not be available to us on acceptable\nterms or at all. In addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our research or development programs. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, product candidates or products which we would otherwise pursue on our own.\nWe may need to enter into collaborations, joint ventures or other alliances with other companies that can provide capabilities and funds for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. If we are unsuccessful in forming or maintaining these arrangements on favorable terms, our business could be adversely affected.\nBecause we have limited or no internal capabilities for late-stage product development, manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution, we may need to enter into strategic alliances with other companies. For example, we have entered into collaboration agreements to develop and commercialize our complex generics programs and certain of our biosimilar programs. In the future, we may also find it necessary to form similar strategic alliances with major pharmaceutical companies to jointly develop and/or commercialize other product candidates across our product areas. In such alliances, we would expect our collaboration partners to provide substantial capabilities in clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory affairs, sales and marketing. We may not be successful in entering into any such alliances. Even if we do succeed in securing such alliances, we may not be able to maintain them if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed or sales of an approved product are disappointing. If we are unable to secure or maintain such alliances we may not have the capabilities necessary to continue or complete development of our product candidates and bring them to market, which may have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition to product development and commercialization capabilities, we may depend on our alliances with other companies to provide substantial additional funding for development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. These alliances may involve the other company purchasing a significant number of shares of our common stock. For example, one of our current collaboration partners, through an affiliate, acquired shares in connection with entering into our collaboration which currently represent approximately 9% of our shares of common stock outstanding. Future alliances may involve similar or greater sales of equity, debt financing or other funding arrangements. We may not be able to obtain funding on favorable terms from these alliances, and if we are not successful in doing so, we may not have sufficient funds to develop a particular product candidate internally or to bring product candidates to market. Failure to bring our product candidates to market will prevent us from generating sales revenue, and this may substantially harm our business. Furthermore, any delay in entering into these alliances could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates and reduce their competitiveness even if they reach the market. As a result, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur current Enoxaparin product revenue is dependent on the continued successful manufacture and commercialization of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection.\nOur near-term ability to generate Enoxaparin product revenue depends, in large part, on Sandoz's continued ability to manufacture and commercialize Enoxaparin Sodium Injection, maintain pricing levels and market share and compete with Lovenox brand competition as well as authorized and other generic competition.\nSandoz is facing increasing competition and pricing pressure from brand, authorized generic and other currently-approved generic competitors, which has and will continue to impact Sandoz net sales of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection, which will therefore impact our product revenue. Furthermore, other\ncompetitors may in the future receive approval to market generic enoxaparin products which would further impact our product revenue.\nDue to these circumstances, the resulting market price for our Enoxaparin Sodium Injection product has decreased and may decrease further, and we have lost market share and may continue to lose market share for Enoxaparin Sodium Injection. All of this may further impact our revenue from Enoxaparin Sodium Injection and, as a result, our business, including our near-term financial results and our ability to fund future discovery and development programs, may suffer.\nIf our patent litigation against Amphastar related to Enoxaparin Sodium Injection is not successful, we may be liable for damages. In addition, third parties may be able to commercialize generic Lovenox products without risk of patent infringement damages, and our business may be materially harmed.\nIf we are not successful in the patent litigation against Amphastar and Actavis and do not succeed in obtaining injunctive relief or damages, the reduction in our revenue stream will be permanent and our ability to fund future discovery and development programs may suffer. Furthermore, in the event that we are not successful in our appeal of the District Court decision to grant summary judgment against us, and Amphastar and Actavis are able to prove they suffered damages as a result of the preliminary injunction having been in effect, we could be liable for up to $35 million of the security bond for such damages. This amount may be increased if Amphastar and Actavis are successful in their motion to increase the amount of the security bond.\nIn addition, if we are not successful in the patent case against Teva and do not succeed in obtaining injunctive relief or a declaratory judgment, we may lose additional market share for Enoxaparin Sodium Injection. Consequently, our revenue would be reduced and our business, including our near-term financial results and our ability to fund future discovery and development programs, may suffer.\nIf efforts by manufacturers of branded products to delay or limit the use of generics or biosimilars are successful, our sales of generic and biosimilar products may suffer.\nMany manufacturers of branded products have increasingly used legislative, regulatory and other means to delay regulatory approval and to seek to restrict competition from manufacturers of generic drugs and could be expected to use similar tactics to delay competition from biosimilars. These efforts have included:\n\u2022 settling patent lawsuits with generic or biosimilar companies, resulting in such patents remaining an obstacle for generic or biosimilar approval by others;\n\u2022 settling paragraph IV patent litigation with generic companies to prevent the expiration of the 180-day generic marketing exclusivity period or to delay the triggering of such exclusivity period;\n\u2022 submitting Citizen Petitions to request the FDA Commissioner to take administrative action with respect to prospective and submitted generic drug or biosimilar applications;\n\u2022 appealing denials of Citizen Petitions in United States federal district courts and seeking injunctive relief to reverse approval of generic drug or biosimilar applications;\n\u2022 restricting access to reference brand products for equivalence and biosimilarity testing that interfere with timely generic and biosimilar development plans, respectively;\n\u2022 conducting medical education with physicians, payors and regulators that claim that generic or biosimilar products are too complex for generic or biosimilar approval and influence potential market share;\n\u2022 seeking state law restrictions on the substitution of generic and biosimilar products at the pharmacy without the intervention of a physician or through other restrictive means such as excessive recordkeeping requirements or patient and physician notification;\n\u2022 seeking federal or state regulatory restrictions on the use of the same non-proprietary name as the reference brand product for a biosimilar or interchangeable biologic;\n\u2022 seeking changes to the United States Pharmacopeia, an industry recognized compilation of drug and biologic standards;\n\u2022 pursuing new patents for existing products or processes which could extend patent protection for a number of years or otherwise delay the launch of generic drugs or biosimilars; and\n\u2022 influencing legislatures so that they attach special regulatory exclusivity or patent extension amendments to unrelated federal legislation.\nThe FDA's practice is to rule within 150 days on Citizen Petitions that seek to prevent approval of an ANDA if the petition was filed after the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA. If, at the end of the 150-day period, the ANDA is not ready for approval or rejection, then the FDA has typically denied and dismissed the petition without acting on the petition. To date, Teva Neuroscience, Inc. has filed seven Citizen Petitions regarding M356, of which six have been denied and dismissed and one was withdrawn by Teva. However, Teva may seek to file future petitions and may also seek reversal of the denial of a Citizen Petition in federal court. Other third parties may also file Citizen Petitions requesting that the FDA adopt specific approval standards for generic or biosimilar products. If the FDA grants future Citizen Petitions, we and Sandoz may be delayed in obtaining, or potentially unable to obtain, approval of the ANDA for M356 which would materially harm our business.\nIf these efforts to delay or block competition are successful, we may be unable to sell our generic products, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nIf the raw materials, including unfractionated heparin, or UFH, used in our products become difficult to obtain, significantly increase in cost or become unavailable, we may be unable to produce our products and this would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe and our collaborative partners and vendors obtain certain raw materials, including UFH, from suppliers who in turn source the materials from other countries, including four suppliers in China. In 2008, due to the occurrence of adverse events associated with the use of UFH, there were global recalls of UFH products, including in the United States, putting our supply chain at risk. Based on investigation by the FDA into those adverse events, the FDA identified a heparin-like contaminant in the implicated UFH products and recommended that manufacturers and suppliers of UFH use additional tests to screen their UFH active pharmaceutical ingredient. We and our collaborative partner worked with the appropriate regulatory authorities to document and to demonstrate that our testing standards meet or exceed all requirements for testing and screening the supply of UFH active pharmaceutical ingredient. The FDA and other authorities have also placed restrictions on the import of some raw materials from China, and may in the future place additional restrictions and testing requirements on the use of raw materials, including UFH, in products intended for sale in the United States. As a result, the raw materials, including UFH, used in our products may become difficult to obtain, significantly increase in cost, or become unavailable to us. If any of these events occur, we and our collaborative partners may be unable to produce our products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the commercial launch or demand for the product, which would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIf we or our collaborative partners and other third parties are unable to satisfy FDA quality standards and related regulatory requirements, experience manufacturing difficulties or are unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or product candidates, our development and commercialization efforts may be materially harmed.\nWe have limited personnel with experience in, and we do not own facilities for, manufacturing any products. We depend upon our collaborative partners and other third parties to provide raw materials meeting FDA quality standards and related regulatory requirements, manufacture the drug substance, produce the final drug product and provide certain analytical services with respect to our products and product candidates. We, our collaborative partners or our third-party contractors may have difficulty meeting FDA manufacturing requirements, including, but not limited to, reproducibility, validation and scale-up, and continued compliance with current good manufacturing practices requirements. In addition, events such as the contamination of UFH may have an adverse impact on the supply of starting or raw materials for some of our products and product candidates, and we, our collaborative partners or our third-party contractors may have difficulty producing products in the quantities necessary to meet FDA requirements or meet anticipated market demand. If we, our collaborative partners or our third-party manufacturers or suppliers are unable to satisfy the FDA manufacturing requirements for our products and product candidates, or are unable to produce our products in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the launch of the product or to meet market demand, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nCompetition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries is intense, and if we are unable to compete effectively, our financial results will suffer.\nThe markets in which we intend to compete are undergoing, and are expected to continue to undergo, rapid and significant technological change. We expect competition to intensify as technological advances are made or new biotechnology products are introduced. New developments by competitors may render our current or future product candidates and/or technologies non-competitive, obsolete or not economical. Our competitors' products may be more efficacious or marketed and sold more effectively than any of our products.\nMany of our competitors have:\n\u2022 significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have at every stage of the discovery, development, manufacturing and commercialization process;\n\u2022 more extensive experience in commercializing generic drugs, conducting nonclinical studies, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, challenging patents and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products;\n\u2022 products that have been approved or are in late stages of development; and\n\u2022 collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and/or research institutions.\nIf we successfully develop and obtain approval for our drug candidates, we will face competition based on many different factors, including:\n\u2022 the safety and effectiveness of our products;\n\u2022 with regard to our generic or biosimilar product candidates, the differential availability of clinical data and experience and willingness of physicians, payors and formularies to rely on biosimilarity data;\n\u2022 the timing and scope of regulatory approvals for these products and regulatory opposition to any product approvals;\n\u2022 the availability and cost of manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sales capabilities;\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our marketing, distribution and sales capabilities;\n\u2022 the price of our products;\n\u2022 the availability and amount of third-party reimbursement for our products; and\n\u2022 the strength of our patent position.\nOur competitors may develop or commercialize products with significant advantages in regard to any of these factors. Our competitors may therefore be more successful in commercializing their products than we are, which could adversely affect our competitive position and business.\nIf we or our collaborators are unable to establish and maintain key customer distribution arrangements, sales of our products, and therefore revenue, would decline.\nGeneric pharmaceutical products are sold through various channels, including retail, mail order, and to hospitals through group purchasing organizations, or GPOs. As Enoxaparin Sodium Injection is primarily a hospital-based product, a large percentage of the revenue for Enoxaparin Sodium Injection is derived through contracts with GPOs. Currently, a relatively small number of GPOs control a substantial portion of generic pharmaceutical sales to hospital customers. In order to establish and maintain contracts with these GPOs, we believe that we, in collaboration with Sandoz, will need to maintain adequate drug supplies, remain price competitive, comply with FDA regulations and provide high-quality products. The GPOs with whom we or our collaborators have established contracts may also have relationships with our competitors and may decide to contract for or otherwise prefer products other than ours, limiting access of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection to certain hospital segments. Our sales could also be negatively affected by any rebates, discounts or fees that are required by our customers, including the GPOs, wholesalers, distributors, retail chains or mail order services, to gain and retain market acceptance for our products. We anticipate that M356 will be primarily distributed through retail channels and mail order services. If we or our collaborators are unable to establish and maintain distribution arrangements with all of these customers, sales of our products, our revenue and our profits would suffer.\nEven if we receive approval to market our product candidates, the market may not be receptive to our product candidates upon their commercial introduction, which could adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient revenue from product sales to maintain or grow our business.\nEven if our product candidates are successfully developed and approved for marketing, our success and growth will also depend upon the acceptance of our products by patients, physicians and third-party payors. Acceptance of our products will be a function of our products being clinically useful, being cost effective and demonstrating superior therapeutic effect with an acceptable side effect profile as compared to existing or future treatments. In addition, even if our products achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to maintain that market acceptance over time.\nFactors that we believe will materially affect market acceptance of our product candidates under development include:\n\u2022 the timing of our receipt of any marketing approvals, the terms of any approval and the countries in which approvals are obtained;\n\u2022 the safety, efficacy and ease of administration of our products;\n\u2022 the competitive pricing of our products;\n\u2022 physician confidence in the safety and efficacy of complex generic products or biosimilars;\n\u2022 the absence of, or limited clinical data available from sameness, biosimilarity or interchangeability testing of our complex generic or biosimilar products;\n\u2022 the success and extent of our physician education and marketing programs;\n\u2022 the clinical, medical affairs, sales, distribution and marketing efforts of competitors; and\n\u2022 the availability and amount of government and third-party payor reimbursement.\nIf our products do not achieve market acceptance, we will not be able to generate sufficient revenue from product sales to maintain or grow our business.\nIf we are not able to retain our current management team or attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and business personnel, our business will suffer.\nWe are dependent on the members of our management team for our business success. Our employment arrangements with our executive officers are terminable by either party on short notice or no notice. We do not carry key person life insurance on the lives of any of our personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers would result in a significant loss in the knowledge and experience that we, as an organization, possess and could cause significant delays, or outright failure, in the development and approval of our product candidates. In addition, there is intense competition from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and other research institutions, for human resources, including management, in the technical fields in which we operate, and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates. Another component of retention is the intrinsic value of equity awards, including stock options. Many stock options granted to our executives and employees are now under pressure given our recent stock performance. If we lose key members of our management team, or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business could be negatively affected.\nThere is a substantial risk of product liability claims in our business. If our existing product liability insurance is insufficient, a product liability claim against us that exceeds the amount of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our business.\nOur business exposes us to significant potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development, manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic products. Product liability claims could delay or prevent completion of our development programs. If we succeed in marketing products, such claims could result in a recall of our products or a change in the approved indications for which they may be used. We cannot be sure that the product liability insurance coverage we maintain will be adequate to cover any incident or all incidents. Furthermore, clinical trial and product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to maintain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect us against losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business. These liabilities could prevent or interfere with our product development and commercialization efforts.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures or security breaches.\nOur internal computer systems are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Any system failure or security breach by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including clinical trial data, intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, our patients or our collaborators may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our\ndevelopment programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Likewise, we rely on third parties to manufacture and commercialize our products and conduct clinical trials, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, the further development and commercialization of our products and product candidates could be delayed, and the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nAs we evolve from a company primarily involved in drug discovery and development into one that is also involved in the commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we may have difficulty managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully.\nAs we advance our product candidates through the development process, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, quality, distribution, sales and marketing capabilities or contract with other organizations to provide these capabilities for us. As our operations expand, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various collaborative partners, suppliers and other organizations. Our ability to manage our operations and growth requires us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. For example, some jurisdictions, such as the District of Columbia, have imposed licensing requirements for sales representatives. In addition, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as well as the federal government by way of the Sunshine Act provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, have established reporting requirements that would require public reporting of consulting and research fees to health care professionals. Because the reporting requirements vary in each jurisdiction, compliance will be complex and expensive and may create barriers to entering the commercialization phase. The need to build new systems as part of our growth could place a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure. We may not be able to make improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. Such requirements may also impact our opportunities to collaborate with physicians at academic research centers as new restrictions on academic-industry relationships are put in place. In the past, collaborations between academia and industry have led to important new innovations, but the new laws may have an effect on these activities. While we cannot predict whether any legislative or regulatory changes will have negative or positive effects, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and potential profitability.\nWe may incur costs and allocate resources to identify and develop additional product candidates or acquire or make investments in companies or technologies without realizing any benefit, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or cash flows.\nAlong with continuing to progress our current product candidates, the long-term success of our business also depends on our ability to successfully identify, develop and commercialize additional product candidates. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential programs and product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful.\nIn addition, we may acquire or invest in companies, products and technologies. Such transactions involve a number of risks, including:\n\u2022 we may find that the acquired company or assets does not further our business strategy, or that we overpaid for the company or assets, or that economic conditions change, all of which may generate a future impairment charge;\n\u2022 difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business, and difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022 difficulty incorporating the acquired technologies;\n\u2022 difficulties or failures with the performance of the acquired technologies or drug products;\n\u2022 we may face product liability risks associated with the sale of the acquired company's products;\n\u2022 disruption or diversion of management's attention by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing diverse locations;\n\u2022 difficulty maintaining uniform standards, internal controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022 the acquisition may result in litigation from terminated employees or third parties; and\n\u2022 we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality, technology and legal contingencies.\nThese factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions in a short period of time. From time to time, we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions that are not ultimately consummated. Such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time, as well as out-of-pocket costs.\nThe consideration paid in connection with an acquisition also affects our financial results. If we were to proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any acquisition. To the extent we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock, including options or other rights, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt, large one-time write-offs and restructuring charges. They may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests, which could result in future impairment charges.\nIf we fail to maintain appropriate internal controls in the future, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, which may adversely affect our stock price and our business.\nOur efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors' audit of that assessment requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources.\nInternal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. If we are unable to maintain effective internal controls, we may not have adequate, accurate or timely financial information, and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations as a publicly traded company or comply with the requirements of the SEC or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This could result in a restatement of our financial statements, the imposition of sanctions, including the inability of registered broker dealers to make a market in our stock, or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action or other negative results caused by our inability to meet our reporting requirements or comply with legal and regulatory requirements or by disclosure of an accounting, reporting or control issue could adversely affect the trading price of our stock and our business.\nRisks Relating to Development and Regulatory Approval\nThe near-term success of our business is significantly dependent on the success of M356. If we are not able to obtain regulatory approval for commercial sale ofM356, our future results of operations will be adversely affected.\nOur future results of operations depend to a significant degree on our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize M356. Our application for M356 has been under review with the FDA since December 2007. To receive approval, we will be required to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA, among other things, that M356:\n\u2022 contains the same active ingredients as Copaxone;\n\u2022 is of the same dosage form, strength and route of administration as Copaxone, and has the same labeling as the approved labeling for Copaxone, with certain exceptions; and\n\u2022 meets compendial or other applicable standards for strength, quality, purity and identity, including potency.\nIn addition, approval of a generic product generally requires demonstrating that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the reference listed drug upon which it is based, meaning that there are no significant differences with respect to the rate and extent to which the active ingredients are absorbed and become available at the site of drug action. However, the FDA may or may not waive the requirements for certain bioequivalence data (including clinical data) for certain drug products, including injectable solutions that have been shown to contain the same active and inactive ingredients in the same concentration as the reference listed drug.\nDetermination of therapeutic equivalence of M356 to Copaxone will be based, in part, on our demonstration of the chemical equivalence of our versions to their respective reference listed drugs. The FDA may not agree that we have adequately characterized M356 or that M356 and Copaxone are chemical equivalents. In that case, the FDA may require additional information, including nonclinical or clinical test results, to determine therapeutic equivalence or to confirm that any inactive ingredients or impurities do not compromise the product's safety and efficacy. Provision of sufficient information for approval may be difficult, expensive and lengthy. We cannot predict whether M356 will receive FDA approval as therapeutically equivalent to Copaxone.\nIn the event that the FDA modifies its current standards for therapeutic equivalence with respect to generic versions of Copaxone, or requires us to conduct clinical trials or complete other lengthy procedures, the commercialization of M356 could be delayed or prevented or become more expensive. Delays in any part of the process or our inability to obtain regulatory approval for M356 could adversely affect our operating results by restricting or significantly delaying our introduction of M356.\nAlthough health care reform legislation that establishes a regulatory pathway for the approval by the FDA of biosimilars has been enacted, the standards for determining similarity or interchangeability for biosimilars are only just being implemented by the FDA. Therefore, substantial uncertainty remains about the potential value our proprietary technology platform can offer to biosimilars development programs.\nThe regulatory climate in the United States for follow-on versions of biologic and complex protein products remains uncertain, even following the recent enactment of legislation establishing a regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. To date, there have been no biosimilar products approved, and, to our knowledge, only a few biosimilar applications have been accepted for review by the FDA, under the 351(k) pathway. The new pathway contemplates approval of two categories of follow-on biologic products: (1) biosimilar products, which are highly similar to the existing brand product, notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences from the brand product and (2) interchangeable biologic products,\nwhich in addition to being biosimilar can be expected to produce the same clinical result in any given patient without an increase in risk due to switching from the brand product. Only interchangeable biosimilar products would be considered interchangeable at the retail pharmacy level without the intervention of a physician. The new legislation authorizes but does not require the FDA to establish standards or criteria for determining biosimilarity and interchangeability, and also authorizes the FDA to use its discretion to determine the nature and extent of product characterization, nonclinical testing and clinical testing on a product-by-product basis.\nOur competitive advantage in this area will depend on our success in demonstrating to the FDA that our analytics, biocharacterization and protein engineering platform technology provides a level of scientific assurance that facilitates determinations of interchangeability, reduces the need for expensive clinical or other testing, and raises the scientific quality requirements for our competitors to demonstrate that their products are highly similar to a brand product. Our ability to succeed will depend in part on our ability to invest in new programs and develop data in a timeframe that enables the FDA to consider our approach as the agency begins to implement the new law. In addition, the FDA will likely require significant new resources and expertise to review biosimilar applications, and the timeliness of the review and approval of our future applications could be adversely affected if there were a decline or even limited growth in FDA funding. Our strategy to minimize non-clinical and clinical requirements by relying on analytical data may not be successful or may take longer than strategies that rely more heavily on non-clinical and clinical trial data.\nThe new regulatory pathway also creates a number of additional obstacles to the approval and launch of biosimilar and interchangeable products, including:\n\u2022 a requirement for the applicant, as a condition to using the patent exchange and clearance process, to share, in confidence, the information in its abbreviated pathway application with the brand company's and patent owner's counsel;\n\u2022 the inclusion of multiple potential patent rights in the patent clearance process; and\n\u2022 a grant to each brand company of 12 years of marketing exclusivity following the brand approval.\nFurthermore, the new regulatory pathway creates the risk that the brand company, during its 12-year marketing exclusivity period, will develop and replace its product with a non-substitutable or modified product that may also qualify for an additional 12-year marketing exclusivity period, reducing the opportunity for substitution at the retail pharmacy level for interchangeable biosimilars. Finally, the new legislation also creates the risk that, as brand and biosimilar companies gain experience with the new regulatory pathway, subsequent FDA determinations or court rulings could create additional areas for potential disputes and resulting delays in biosimilars approval.\nIn addition, there is reconsideration and legislative debate that could lead to the repeal or amendment of the new healthcare legislation. If the legislation is significantly amended or is repealed with respect to the biosimilar approval pathway, our opportunity to develop biosimilars (including interchangeable biologics) could be materially impaired and our business could be materially and adversely affected. Similarly, the legislative debate at the federal level regarding the federal government budget in 2013 restricted federal agency funding for the biosimilar pathway, including biosimilar user fee funding for fiscal year 2014, and has resulted in delays in the conduct of meetings with biosimilar applicants and the review of biosimilar meeting and application information. The scheduling and conduct of biosimilar meeting and applications review was also suspended during the U.S. Government shutdown in October 2013, and could be subject to future suspensions as a result of future deadlocks in passage of federal appropriations bills in 2015 or future years. Depending on the timing and the extent of these funding, meeting and review disruptions, our development of biosimilar products could be delayed.\nEven if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for our generic and interchangeable biologic product candidates as therapeutically equivalent or interchangeable, state pharmacy boards or agencies may conclude that our products are not substitutable at the pharmacy level for the reference listed drug. If our generic or interchangeable biologic products are not substitutable at the pharmacy level for their reference listed drugs, this could materially reduce sales of our products and our business would suffer.\nAlthough the FDA may determine that a generic product is therapeutically equivalent to a brand product and provide it with an \"A\" rating in the FDA's Orange Book, this designation is not binding on state pharmacy boards or agencies for generic drugs. As a result, in states that do not deem our generic drug candidates therapeutically equivalent, physicians will be required to specifically prescribe a generic product alternative rather than have a routine substitution at the pharmacy level for the prescribed brand product. Should this occur with respect to one of our generic product candidates, it could materially reduce sales in those states which would substantially harm our business.\nWhile a designation of interchangeability is a finding by the FDA that a biosimilar can be substituted at the pharmacy without physician intervention or prescription, brand pharmaceutical companies are lobbying state legislatures to enact physician prescription requirements, or in the absence of a prescription, physician and patient notification requirements, special labeling requirements and alternative naming requirements which if enacted could create barriers to substitution and adoption rates of interchangeable biologics as well as biosimilars. Should this occur with respect to one of our biosimilars or interchangeable biologic product candidates, it could materially reduce sales in those states which would substantially harm our business.\nIf our nonclinical studies and clinical trials for our development candidates, including necuparanib, are not successful, we will not be able to obtain regulatory approval for commercial sale of our novel or improved drug candidates.\nTo obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of our novel product candidates, we are required to demonstrate through nonclinical studies and clinical trials that our drug development candidates are safe and effective. Nonclinical studies and clinical trials of new development candidates are lengthy and expensive and the historical failure rate for development candidates is high.\nA failure of one or more of our nonclinical studies or clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, nonclinical studies and clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize necuparanib or our other drug candidates, including:\n\u2022 regulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022 our nonclinical studies or clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may be required to conduct additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials or we may abandon projects that we previously expected to be promising;\n\u2022 enrollment in our clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, resulting in significant delays, and participants may drop out of our clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022 we might have to suspend or terminate our clinical trials if the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022 regulators or institutional review boards may require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or if, in their opinion, participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022 the cost of our clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022 the effects of our drug candidates may not be the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or our product candidates may have other unexpected characteristics; and\n\u2022 we may decide to modify or expand the clinical trials we are undertaking if new agents are introduced that influence current standard of care and medical practice, warranting a revision to our clinical development plan.\nThe results from nonclinical studies of a development candidate may not predict the results that will be obtained in human clinical trials. If we are required by regulatory authorities to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of necuparanib or our other product candidates that we did not anticipate, if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other tests, or if the results of these trials are not positive or are only modestly positive, we may be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our drug candidates or we may not be able to obtain marketing approval at all. Our product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals. Significant clinical trial delays could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our products or potential products. If any of these events occur, our business will be materially harmed.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent us from marketing our products abroad.\nWe intend in the future to market our products, if approved, outside of the United States, either directly or through collaborative partners. In order to market our products in the European Union and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with the numerous and varying regulatory requirements of each jurisdiction. The approval procedure and requirements vary among countries, and can require, among other things, conducting additional testing in each jurisdiction. The time required to obtain approval abroad may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval, and we may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in any other foreign country or by the FDA. We and our collaborators may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market outside of the United States. The failure to obtain these approvals could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approvals, our marketed products will be subject to ongoing regulatory review. If we fail to comply with continuing United States and foreign regulations, we could lose our approvals to market products and our business would be seriously harmed.\nEven after approval, any drugs or biological products we develop will be subject to ongoing regulatory review, including the review of clinical results which are reported after our products are made commercially available. Any regulatory approvals that we obtain for our product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. In addition, the manufacturer and manufacturing facilities we use to produce any of our product candidates will be subject to periodic review and inspection by the FDA, or foreign equivalent, and other regulatory agencies. We will be required to report any serious and unexpected adverse experiences and certain quality problems with our products and make other periodic reports to the FDA. The discovery of any new or previously unknown problems with the product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer or facility, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Certain changes to an approved product, including in the way it is\nmanufactured or promoted, often require prior FDA approval before the product as modified may be marketed. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, warning letters, civil penalties, refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls and seizures, injunctions, operating restrictions, refusal to permit the import or export of products, and/or criminal prosecutions and penalties.\nSimilarly, our commercial activities will be subject to comprehensive compliance obligations under state and federal reimbursement, Sunshine Act, anti-kickback and government pricing regulations. If we make false price reports, fail to implement adequate compliance controls or our employees violate the laws and regulations governing relationships with health care providers, we could also be subject to substantial fines and penalties, criminal prosecution and debarment from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid, or other government reimbursement programs.\nIn addition, the FDA's policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit, or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\nIf third-party payors do not adequately reimburse customers for any of our approved products, they might not be purchased or used, and our revenue and profits will not develop or increase.\nOur revenue and profits will depend heavily upon the availability of adequate reimbursement for the use of our approved product candidates from governmental and other third-party payors, both in the United States and in foreign markets. Reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor's determination that use of a product is:\n\u2022 a covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u2022 safe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u2022 appropriate for the specific patient;\n\u2022 cost-effective; and\n\u2022 neither experimental nor investigational.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from each government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to each payor. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. There is substantial uncertainty whether any particular payor will reimburse the use of any drug product incorporating new technology. Even when a payor determines that a product is eligible for reimbursement, the payor may impose coverage limitations that preclude payment for some uses that are approved by the FDA or comparable authority. Moreover, eligibility for coverage does not imply that any product will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate that allows us to make a profit or even cover our costs. Interim payments for new products, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on payments allowed for lower-cost products that are already reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other products or services, and may reflect budgetary constraints and/or imperfections in Medicare, Medicaid or other data used to calculate these rates. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or\nrebates required by government health care programs or by any future relaxation of laws that restrict imports of certain medical products from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States.\nThere have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, federal and state proposals to constrain expenditures for medical products and services, which may affect payments for our products. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, frequently change product descriptors, coverage policies, product and service codes, payment methodologies and reimbursement values. Third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and both CMS and other third-party payors may have sufficient market power to demand significant price reductions. Due in part to actions by third-party payors, the health care industry is experiencing a trend toward containing or reducing costs through various means, including lowering reimbursement rates, limiting therapeutic class coverage and negotiating reduced payment schedules with service providers for drug products.\nWe also anticipate that application of the existing and evolving reimbursement regimes to biosimilar products will be somewhat uncertain as CMS determines whether to apply generic drug reimbursement approaches or to develop new mechanisms for assigning reimbursement codes to biosimilar products. Reimbursement uncertainty could adversely impact market acceptance of biosimilar products.\nOur inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from government-funded and private payors for our products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and our overall financial condition.\nFederal legislation will increase the pressure to reduce prices of pharmaceutical products paid for by Medicare or may otherwise seek to limit healthcare costs, either of which could adversely affect our revenue, if any.\nThe Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and reimburses for pharmaceutical products. The legislation introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for drugs that are used in hospital settings or under the direct supervision of a physician and, starting in 2006, expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly. In addition, the MMA requires the creation of formularies for self-administered drugs, and provides authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class and provides for plan sponsors to negotiate prices with manufacturers and suppliers of covered drugs. As a result of the MMA and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect continuing pressure to contain and reduce costs of pharmaceutical products. Cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for our products and could materially adversely affect our operating results and overall financial condition. While the MMA generally applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies and any reduction in coverage or payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in coverage or payments from private payors.\nFurthermore, health care reform legislation that was enacted in 2010 and is now being implemented could significantly change the United States health care system and the reimbursement of products. A primary goal of the law is to reduce or limit the growth of health care costs, which could change the market for pharmaceuticals and biological products.\nThe law contains provisions that will affect companies in the pharmaceutical industry and other healthcare-related industries by imposing additional costs and changes to business practices. Provisions affecting pharmaceutical companies include an increase to the mandatory rebates for drugs sold into the Medicaid program, an extension of the rebate requirement to drugs used in risk-based Medicaid managed care plans, an extension of mandatory discounts for drug products sold to certain critical\naccess hospitals, cancer hospitals and other covered entities, and discounts and fees applicable to brand-name drugs. Although many of these provisions may not apply directly to us, they may change business practices in our industry and, assuming our products are approved for commercial sale, such changes could adversely impact our profitability.\nAdditionally, the BPCI establishes an abbreviated regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars and provides that brand biologic products may receive 12 years of market exclusivity, with a possible six-month extension for pediatric products. By creating a new approval pathway for biosimilars and adjusting reimbursement for biosimilars, the new law could promote the development and commercialization of biosimilars. However, given the uncertainty of how the law will be interpreted and implemented, the impact of the law on our strategy for biosimilars as well as novel biologics remains uncertain. Other provisions in the law, such as the comparative effectiveness provisions, may ultimately impact positively or negatively both brand and biosimilars products alike depending on an applicant's clinical data, effectiveness and cost profile. If a brand product cannot be shown to provide a benefit over other therapies, then it might receive reduced coverage and reimbursement. While this might increase market share for biosimilars based on cost savings, it could also have the effect of reducing biosimilars' market share.\nThe financial impact of this United States health care reform legislation over the next few years will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to the issuance of implementation regulations and guidance and changes in sales volumes for products eligible for the new system of rebates, discounts and fees.\nThe full effects of the United States health care reform legislation cannot be known until the new law is implemented through regulations or guidance issued by the CMS and other federal and state health care agencies. While we cannot predict whether any legislative or regulatory changes will have negative or positive effects, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and potential profitability. In addition, litigation may prevent some or all of the legislation from taking effect. Consequently, there is uncertainty regarding implementation of the new legislation.\nForeign governments tend to impose strict price or reimbursement controls, which may adversely affect our revenue, if any.\nIn some foreign countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing and/or reimbursement of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be adversely affected.\nIf we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur research and development involves, and may in the future involve, the use of hazardous materials and chemicals and certain radioactive materials and related equipment. If an accident occurs, we could be held liable for resulting damages, which could be substantial. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials. Insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities and we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us. Additional federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted in the future. We\nmay incur substantial costs to comply with, and substantial fines or penalties if we violate, any of these laws or regulations.\nThe FDA has reported that it has a substantial backlog of ANDA filings that have resulted in significant delays in review and approval of applications. As a result, the review and potential approval of our applications for M356 may be significantly delayed.\nThe FDA has reported that it has a substantial backlog of ANDA filings that have resulted in significant delays in the review and approval of ANDAs and amendments or supplements due to insufficient staffing and resources. Resource constraints have also resulted in significant delays in conducting ANDA-related pre-approval inspections. Enactment of user fee legislation in 2012 is only beginning to fund additional resources and the impact of the new legislation which implements goals and metrics for application review has been reported by the FDA to have had limited impact to this backlog and the delays as it recruits and trains new FDA staff. Until such time as resources are actually increased and in place at the FDA, our applications and supplements may be subject to significant delays during their review cycles.\nRisks Relating to Patents and Licenses\nIf we are not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for our discoveries, our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will be harmed and we may not be able to operate our business profitably.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop under the patent and other intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries, so that we can prevent others from using our inventions and proprietary information. Because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of discoveries in scientific literature lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in issued patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in our patent applications. As a result, we may be required to obtain licenses under third-party patents to market our proposed products. If licenses are not available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, we will not be able to market the affected products.\nAssuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application is entitled to the patent. We may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights.\nOur strategy depends on our ability to rapidly identify and seek patent protection for our discoveries. This process is expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may be able to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. The issuance of a patent does not guarantee that it is valid or enforceable, so even if we obtain patents, they may not be valid or enforceable against third parties.\nOur pending patent applications may not result in issued patents. The patent position of pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, including ours, is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual considerations. The standards which the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. There is also no uniform, worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary information to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems and costs in protecting their proprietary information in these foreign countries.\nThere is presently uncertainty regarding the scope of the safe harbor from patent infringement under federal patent law, 35 USC section 271(e)(1), for activities related to developing and submitting information under a federal law. This uncertainty is especially high for our patents protecting our testing methods. The scope and application of the safe harbor is the subject of our on-going patent litigation with Amphastar. Additional information about this litigation is set forth under Part I, Item 3 \"Legal Proceedings\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The uncertainty regarding the scope of the safe harbor may impair our ability to enforce certain of our patent rights and reduce the likelihood of enforcing certain of our patent rights to protect our innovations and our products. Accordingly, we do not know the degree of future enforceability for some of our proprietary rights.\nThe breadth of patent claims allowed in any patents issued to us or to others may be unclear. The allowance of broader claims may increase the incidence and cost of patent interference proceedings and/or opposition proceedings, and the risk of infringement litigation. On the other hand, the allowance of narrower claims may limit the value of our proprietary rights. Our issued patents may not contain claims sufficiently broad to protect us against third parties with similar technologies or products, or provide us with any competitive advantage. Moreover, once they have issued, our patents and any patent for which we have licensed or may license rights may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. If our patents are invalidated or otherwise limited, other companies will be better able to develop products that compete with ours, which could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, know-how and technology, which are not protected by patents, to maintain our competitive position. If any trade secret, know-how or other technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThird parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, forcing us to expend substantial resources in resulting litigation, the outcome of which would be uncertain. Any unfavorable outcome of such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe issuance of our own patents does not guarantee that we have the right to practice the patented inventions. Third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from marketing our own patented product and practicing our own patented technology.\nIf any party asserts that we are infringing its intellectual property rights or that our creation or use of proprietary technology infringes upon its intellectual property rights, we might be forced to incur expenses to respond to and litigate the claims. Furthermore, we may be ordered to pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party's patent rights. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in litigation, or pending the outcome of litigation, a court could issue a temporary injunction or a permanent injunction preventing us from marketing and selling the patented drug or other technology for the life of the patent that we have been alleged or deemed to have infringed. Litigation concerning intellectual property and proprietary technologies is widespread and can be protracted and expensive, and can distract management and other key personnel from performing their duties for us.\nAny legal action against us or our collaborators claiming damages and seeking to enjoin any activities, including commercial activities relating to the affected products, and processes could, in addition to subjecting us to potential liability for damages, require us or our collaborators to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products and processes. Any license required under any patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, and therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us.\nIf we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent, we may be unable to effectively market some of our technology and products, which could limit our ability to generate revenue or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations.\nIf we remain involved in patent litigation or other proceedings to determine or enforce our intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial costs which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may need to continue to resort to litigation to enforce a patent issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of a third-party patent or other proprietary rights such as trade secrets in jurisdictions where we intend to market our products, including the United States, the European Union, and many other foreign jurisdictions. The cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to determining the validity of intellectual property rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial and could divert our management's efforts. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they may have substantially greater resources. Moreover, the failure to obtain a favorable outcome in any litigation in a jurisdiction where there is a claim of patent infringement could significantly delay the marketing of our products in that particular jurisdiction. Counterclaims for damages and other relief may be triggered by such enforcement actions. The costs, uncertainties and counterclaims resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue our operations.\nWe in-license a portion of our proprietary technologies and if we fail to comply with our obligations under any of the related agreements, we could lose license rights that are necessary to develop our product candidates.\nWe are a party to and rely on a number of in-license agreements with third parties, such as those with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Rockefeller University, which give us rights to intellectual property that may be necessary for certain parts of our business. In addition, we expect to enter into additional licenses in the future. Our current in-license arrangements impose various diligence, development, royalty and other obligations on us. If we breach our obligations with regard to our exclusive in-licenses, they could be converted to non-exclusive licenses or the agreements could be terminated, which would result in our being unable to develop, manufacture and sell products that are covered by the licensed technology.\nRisks Relating to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nThe 2003 Sandoz Collaboration and 2006 Sandoz Collaboration are important to our business. If Sandoz fails to adequately perform under either collaboration, or if we or Sandoz terminate all or a portion of either collaboration, the development and commercialization of some of our drug candidates, including Enoxaparin Sodium Injection, would be delayed or terminated and our business would be adversely affected.\n2003 Sandoz Collaboration\nEither we or Sandoz may terminate the 2003 Sandoz Collaboration for material uncured breaches or certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency by the other party. Sandoz may also terminate the 2003 Sandoz Collaboration if the Enoxaparin Sodium Injection product or the market lacks commercial viability, if new laws or regulations are passed or court decisions rendered that substantially diminish\nour legal avenues for commercialization of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection, or, in multiple cases, if certain costs exceed mutually agreed upon limits. If the 2003 Sandoz Collaboration is terminated other than due to our uncured breach or bankruptcy, we will be granted an exclusive license under certain intellectual property of Sandoz to develop and commercialize Enoxaparin Sodium Injection in the United States. In that event, we would need to expand our internal capabilities or enter into another collaboration, which could cause significant delays that could prevent us from commercializing Enoxaparin Sodium Injection. If Sandoz terminates the 2003 Sandoz Collaboration due to our uncured breach or bankruptcy, Sandoz would retain the exclusive right to commercialize Enoxaparin Sodium Injection in the United States. In that event, we would no longer have any influence over the commercialization strategy of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection in the United States. In addition, Sandoz would retain its rights of first negotiation with respect to certain of our other products in certain circumstances and its rights of first refusal outside of the United States and the European Union.\nAccordingly, if Sandoz terminates the 2003 Sandoz Collaboration, we may decide to discontinue the Enoxaparin Sodium Injection program, or our revenue may be reduced, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n2006 Sandoz Collaboration\nEither we or Sandoz may terminate the Second Sandoz Collaboration Agreement for material uncured breaches or certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency by the other party. In addition, either we or Sandoz may terminate some of the products, on a product-by-product basis, if clinical trials are required. For some of the products, for any termination of the Second Sandoz Collaboration Agreement other than a termination by Sandoz due to our uncured breach or bankruptcy, or a termination by us alone due to the need for clinical trials, we will be granted an exclusive license under certain intellectual property of Sandoz to develop and commercialize the particular product. In that event, we would need to expand our internal capabilities or enter into another collaboration, which could cause significant delays that could prevent us from completing the development and commercialization of such product. For some products, if Sandoz terminates the Second Sandoz Collaboration Agreement due to our uncured breach or bankruptcy, or if there is a termination by us alone due to the need for clinical trials, Sandoz would retain the exclusive right to develop and commercialize the applicable product. In that event, we would no longer have any influence over the development or commercialization strategy of such product. In addition, for other products, if Sandoz terminates due to our uncured breach or bankruptcy, Sandoz retains a right to license certain of our intellectual property without the obligation to make any additional payments for such licenses. For certain products, if the Second Sandoz Collaboration Agreement is terminated other than due to our uncured breach or bankruptcy, neither party will have a license to the other party's intellectual property. In that event, we would need to expand our internal capabilities or enter into another collaboration, which, if we were able to do so, could cause significant delays that could prevent us from completing the development and commercialization of such product. Any alternative collaboration could also be on less favorable terms to us. Accordingly, if the Second Sandoz Collaboration Agreement is terminated, our introduction of certain products may be significantly delayed, or our revenue may be significantly reduced, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUnder our collaboration agreements, we are dependent upon Sandoz to successfully continue to commercialize Enoxaparin Sodium Injection, and if it is approved , we will be dependent on Sandoz to successfully commercialize M356. We do not control Sandoz's commercialization activities or the resources it allocates to our products. Our interests and Sandoz's interests may differ or conflict from time-to-time or we may disagree with Sandoz's level of effort or resource allocation. Sandoz may internally prioritize our products differently than we do or it may fail to allocate sufficient resources to\neffectively or optimally commercialize our products. If these events were to occur, our business would be adversely affected.\nThe Baxter Agreement is important to our business. If we or Baxter fail to adequately perform under the Agreement, or if we or Baxter terminate the Agreement, the development and commercialization of our lead biosimilar, M923, would be delayed or terminated and our business would be adversely affected.\nThe Baxter Agreement may be terminated:\n\u2022 by either party for breach by the other party (in whole or on a product by product or country-by-country basis);\n\u2022 by either party for bankruptcy of the other party;\n\u2022 by Baxter for its convenience;\n\u2022 by us in the event Baxter does not exercise commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize M923 in the United States or other specified countries, provided, that we also have certain rights to directly commercialize M923, as opposed to terminating the Baxter Agreement, in event of such a breach by Baxter; or\n\u2022 by either party in the event there is a condition constituting force majeure for more than a certain consecutive number of days.\nIf the Baxter Agreement were terminated by Baxter for convenience or if Baxter elects to terminate the Baxter Agreement with respect to M923 in the specified time frame or if we terminate the Baxter Agreement for breach by Baxter, while we would have the right to research, develop, manufacture or commercialize the terminated products or license a third party to do so, we would need to expand our internal capabilities or enter into another collaboration, which, if we were able to do so, could cause significant delays that could prevent us from commercializing our biosimilar candidates. For example, in February 2015, Baxter terminated in part the Baxter Agreement as it relates specifically to M834. As a result, continued development of M834 may be delayed until we can enter into another collaboration to develop that program. Any alternative collaboration could also be on less favorable terms to us. In addition, we may need to seek additional financing to support the research, development and commercialization of any terminated products or alternatively we may decide to discontinue any terminated products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If Baxter terminates the Baxter Agreement due to our uncured breach, Baxter would retain the exclusive right to commercialize M923 on a world-wide basis, subject to certain payment obligations to us as outlined in the Agreement. In addition, depending upon the timing of the termination, we would no longer have any influence over or input into the clinical development strategy or/and the commercialization strategy or/and the legal strategy of M923.\nUnder the Baxter Agreement, we are dependent upon Baxter to successfully conduct clinical trials for, and if approved, commercialize M923. We do not control Baxter's administration of the clinical trials, commercialization activities or the resources it allocates to M923. Our interests and Baxter's interests may differ or conflict from time to time, or we may disagree with Baxter's level of effort or resource allocation. Baxter may internally prioritize M923 differently than we do or it may not allocate sufficient resources to effectively or optimally administer clinical trials for, or commercialize, M923. If these events were to occur, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe and our collaborative partners depend on third parties for the manufacture of products. If we encounter difficulties in our supply or manufacturing arrangements, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nWe have a limited number of personnel with experience in, and we do not own facilities for, manufacturing products. In addition, we do not have, and do not intend to develop, the ability to\nmanufacture material for our clinical trials or at commercial scale. To develop our product candidates, apply for regulatory approvals and commercialize any products, we or our collaborative partners need to contract for or otherwise arrange for the necessary manufacturing facilities and capabilities. In order to generate revenue from the sales of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection, sufficient quantities of such product must also be produced in order to satisfy demand. If these contract manufacturers are unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of product, comply with regulatory requirements, or breach or terminate their manufacturing arrangements with us, the development and commercialization of the affected products or drug candidates could be delayed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, any change in these manufacturers could be costly because the commercial terms of any new arrangement could be less favorable and the expenses relating to the transfer of necessary technology and processes could be significant.\nWe have relied upon third parties to produce material for nonclinical and clinical studies and may continue to do so in the future. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain and/or maintain long-term supply and supply arrangements of those materials on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to arrange for third-party manufacturing, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development of our products or market them.\nIn addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities require that our products be manufactured according to current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations and that proper procedures are implemented to assure the quality of our sourcing of raw materials and the manufacture of our products. Any failure by us, our collaborative partners or our third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP, and/or our failure to scale-up our manufacturing processes could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval. In addition, such failure could be the basis for action by the FDA to withdraw approvals for drug candidates previously granted to us and for other regulatory action, including product recall or seizure, fines, imposition of operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production or injunctions. To the extent we rely on a third-party manufacturer, the risk of non-compliance with cGMPs may be greater and the ability to effect corrective actions for any such noncompliance may be compromised or delayed.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate product revenue.\nWe do not have a sales organization and have no experience as a company in the sale, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. There are risks involved with establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities, as well as entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, developing a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. In addition, to the extent that we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing or distribution services, we will have less control over sales of our products and our future revenue would depend heavily on the success of the efforts of these third parties.\nA significant change in the business operations of, or a change in senior executive management within, our collaboration partners or third party manufacturers could have a negative impact on our business operations.\nSince many of our product candidates are developed under collaborations with third parties, we do not have sole decision making authority with respect to commercialization or development of those product candidates. We have built relationships and work collaboratively with our third party collaborators and manufacturers to ensure the success of our development and commercialization efforts. A significant change in the senior management team, or business operations, including, for example, a change in control or internal corporate restructuring, of any of our collaboration partners or third party manufacturers could result in delayed timelines on our products. In addition, we may have to re-establish working relationships and familiarize new counterparts with our products and business. Any such change may result in the collaboration partner or third party manufacturer internally\nre-prioritizing our programs or decreasing resources allocated to support our programs. Similar changes with respect to any of our other collaborators may negatively impact our business operations.\nGeneral Company Related Risks\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and our by-laws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. These provisions include:\n\u2022 a classified board of directors;\n\u2022 a prohibition on actions by our stockholders by written consent; and\n\u2022 limitations on the removal of directors.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Finally, these provisions establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings. These provisions would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe stock market in general and the market prices for securities of biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. The trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Furthermore, our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022 failure to obtain FDA approval for the M356 20 mg/mL ANDA or other announcements that indicated a delay in the approval of the M356 20 mg/mL ANDA;\n\u2022 delays in achievement of, or failure to achieve, program milestones that are associated with the valuation of our company or significant milestone revenue;\n\u2022 failure of Enoxaparin Sodium Injection to sustain profitable sales or market share that meet expectations of securities analysts;\n\u2022 other adverse FDA decisions relating to our Enoxaparin Sodium Injection product or M356 program, including an FDA decision to require additional data, including requiring clinical trials, as a condition to M356 20 mg/mL ANDA approval;\n\u2022 litigation involving our company or our general industry or both, including litigation pertaining to the launch of our, our collaborative partners' or our competitors' products;\n\u2022 a decision in favor of or against Teva or Amphastar and Actavis in our patent litigation suits, or a settlement related to any case;\n\u2022 announcements by other companies regarding the status of their ANDAs for generic versions of Lovenox or Copaxone;\n\u2022 FDA approval of other companies' ANDAs for generic versions of Lovenox or Copaxone;\n\u2022 marketing and/or launch of other companies' generic versions of Lovenox or Copaxone;\n\u2022 adverse FDA decisions regarding the development requirements for one of our biosimilar development candidates or failure of our other product applications to meet the requirements for regulatory review and/or approval;\n\u2022 results or delays in our or our competitors' clinical trials or regulatory filings;\n\u2022 enactment of legislation that repeals the law enacting the biosimilar regulatory approval pathway or amends the law in a manner that is adverse to our biosimilar development strategy;\n\u2022 failure to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence, biosimilarity or interchangeability with respect to our technology-enabled generic product candidates or biosimilars;\n\u2022 demonstration of or failure to demonstrate the safety and efficacy for our novel product candidates;\n\u2022 our inability to manufacture any products in conformance with cGMP or in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the commercial launch of the product or to meet market demand;\n\u2022 failure of any of our product candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success;\n\u2022 the discovery of unexpected or increased incidence in patients' adverse reactions to the use of our products or product candidates or indications of other safety concerns;\n\u2022 developments or disputes concerning our patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022 changes in estimates of our financial results or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022 termination of any of our product development and commercialization collaborations;\n\u2022 significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 investors' general perception of our company, our products, the economy and general market conditions;\n\u2022 rapid or disorderly sales of stock by holders of significant amounts of our stock; or\n\u2022 significant fluctuations in the price of securities generally or biotech company securities specifically.\nIf any of these factors causes an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, the price of our common stock could fall and investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above their respective purchase prices.\nWe could be subject to class action litigation due to stock price volatility, which, if it occurs, will distract our management and could result in substantial costs or large judgments against us.\nThe stock market in general has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In addition, the market prices of securities of companies in the biotechnology industry have been extremely volatile and have experienced fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These fluctuations could adversely affect the market\nprice of our common stock. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities. We may be the target of similar litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources, which could cause serious harm to our business, operating results and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 90233, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "MNTA"}
