{"cik": "727510", "company": "ENZON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by one or more of the following factors, any of which could cause actual results to vary materially from historical and current results or anticipated future results.\nRisks Relating to the Company and its Operations\nOur search for a business, company or assets to acquire or in which to invest may be unsuccessful, and we may fail to maximize our return on the proceeds of our Rights Offering and/or realize the value of our NOLs.\nWe are positioned as a public company acquisition vehicle, where we can become an acquisition platform and more fully utilize our NOLs and enhance stockholder value. We intend to acquire profitable businesses, entities or revenue streams that will generate sufficient income so that we can utilize our approximately $103 million NOLs. However, we do not have any current plans, arrangements or understandings with respect to any acquisitions or investments, and we have not identified any actionable acquisition candidates. We will have significant discretion in the use of the net proceeds of our Rights Offering, and it is possible that we will fail to maximize our return on such proceeds. While we expect that, ultimately, we will be successful in realizing the value of our NOLs, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt the approval and manufacture of products for which we share the right to receive licensing fees, milestone payments and royalties and may negatively impact our search for an acquisition target, and the business and/or results of operations of any target business that we acquire or in which we invest.\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the global spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic. In an effort to slow the spread of the virus, the United States and many other countries around the world imposed restrictions on non-essential work activities, travel and mass gatherings. Although these restrictions have been eased in some areas, it is not known whether these lockdowns and other restrictions will be reintroduced, especially in light of the uncertainty regarding cases in the United States, when they will end or the ultimate impact these unprecedented actions will have on our financial condition and prospects.\nAt the present time, our own business activities have been largely unaffected by COVID-19 restrictions as our workforce is comprised solely of independent contractors who are able to perform their duties remotely. However, these restrictions may impact the third parties who are responsible for obtaining final approval of and manufacturing product candidates for which we share the right to receive licensing fees, milestone payments and royalty revenues. If those third parties are required to curtail their business activities for a significant time, or if global supply chain disruptions impact their ability to procure needed resources, raw materials or components, our right to receive licensing fees, milestone payments or royalties could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, the development timeline for product candidates that are pending FDA approval could be delayed if the agency is required to shift resources to the review and approval of candidates for treatment of COVID-19.\nIn addition, the business and/or results of operations of any potential target business, that we acquire or in which we invest, could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete any such acquisitions or investments if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors or the target company\u2019s personnel, vendors and service providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner or if COVID-19 causes a prolonged economic downturn, including the duration of the ongoing economic conditions. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business to acquire or in which to invest will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate a business acquisition or investment, or the business and/or results of operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate an acquisition or investment, may be materially adversely affected.\nThe degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business and results of operations, including our ability to acquire profitable businesses, entities or revenue streams, will depend on future developments beyond our control, including the severity of the pandemic, the extent of actions to contain the virus, availability of a vaccine or other treatment, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume and the severity and duration of the global economic challenges resulting from the pandemic.\nOur sources of revenue are limited and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future; while we increased our cash reserve by completing the Rights Offering, unanticipated liabilities and expenses could adversely affect our ability to engage in a public company acquisition or investment, as currently intended, or to continue operations.\nWe have incurred losses in the current period and have limited sources of revenues. Although we received approximately $43.1 million of net proceeds from the Rights Offering, which we intend to use to position us as a public company acquisition vehicle, unless and until we can consummate an acquisition or investment that generates income, or unless and until we begin receiving significant milestone and royalty payments that may become due from the sale of Vicineum by Sesen Bio, Inc. (\u201cSesen\u201d), we do not anticipate generating any additional cash or revenues. We have been informed by Merck that there will likely be no or minimal additional sales of PegIntron and we would likely receive no further significant royalties, although we may remain potentially liable to Merck for product returns and rebates. Based on current estimates, we do not expect any liability for those returns and rebates to be material. Moreover, our right to receive royalty revenues from other products is limited and we currently do not intend to acquire new sources of royalty revenues. For those remaining existing or potential sources of royalty revenue, our licensees may be unable to maintain regulatory approvals for currently licensed products or obtain regulatory approvals for new products. Safety issues could also result in the failure to maintain regulatory approvals or decrease revenues.\nWhile we have substantially reduced our operating expenses in anticipation of the decline in revenues, including ceasing our research and development activities, eliminating our workforce in favor of independent contractors, and discontinuing our significant lease commitments, we may incur unanticipated liabilities or expenses, including expenses to defend unasserted product liability claims or greater than expected liabilities for PegIntron and expenses incurred in our search for a target business to acquire or in which to invest. Any such expenses or liabilities could impact the availability of assets that we expect to use to fund future operations or adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to shareholders upon a liquidation of the Company.\nWe have outsourced all corporate functions, which makes us more dependent on third parties to perform these corporate functions.\nWe have outsourced all corporate functions, which makes us more dependent on third parties for the performance of these functions. To the extent that we are unable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities, retain key officers as consultants, maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, establish and maintain agreements with competent third-party contractors on terms that are acceptable to us, or effectively manage the work performed by any retained third-party contractors, our ability to manage the operations effectively could be compromised. Our current CEO intends to retire from such role effective February 26, 2021, at which time our current CFO will also become our CEO.\nWhile we intend to acquire profitable businesses, entities or revenue streams that will generate sufficient income so that we can utilize our NOLs, we may be unable to do so and, accordingly, we may be unable to realize our deferred income tax assets.\nThe ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income, executing tax planning strategies, and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets, which may fluctuate as conditions change. While we are positioned as a public company acquisition vehicle and intend to acquire profitable businesses, entities or revenue streams that will generate sufficient income so that we can utilize our NOLs, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to do so.\nIn addition, our ability to utilize our NOLs to offset our future taxable income and/or to recover previously paid taxes would be limited if we were to undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d (within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d at any time over the testing period.\nAn ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code would establish an annual limitation to the amount of NOLs we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any single year. The application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our NOLs. Although we have adopted a Section 382 rights plan in an effort to protect stockholder value by attempting to protect against a possible limitation on our ability to use our NOLs, we cannot assure you that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382. (See Notes 9 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock ranks junior to our Series C Preferred Stock.\nWith respect to the payment of cash dividends and amount payable in the event our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, our common stock will rank junior to our Series C Preferred Stock. This means that, unless full dividends (i) have been paid, (ii) redeemed in an amount in excess of the initial liquidation value of $1,000 or (iii) set aside for payment on all outstanding Series C Preferred Stock for all dividends or increases in the liquidation value in excess of the initial liquidation amount of $1,000 of such Series C Preferred Stock, no cash dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to the holders of our Series C Preferred Stock the liquidation preference related to such Series C Preferred Stock, plus in each case any accrued and unpaid dividends.\nThe interests of our significant stockholders may conflict with the interests of other stockholders.\nMr. Carl C. Icahn, directly and indirectly, beneficially owns approximately 49% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, as well as approximately 98% of the outstanding Series C Preferred Stock. Mr. Icahn may have interests that are different from, in addition to or not always consistent with our interests or with the interests of our other common or preferred stockholders. To the extent that conflicts of interest may arise between us and Mr. Icahn and his affiliates, those conflicts may be resolved in a manner adverse to us or our other stockholders. In addition, the existence of significant stockholders may have the effect of making it difficult for, or may discourage or delay, a third party from seeking to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, such stockholders may exert significant influence over our operations.\nThe price of our common stock has historically been volatile and may decline significantly if we are unable to consummate a business acquisition or investment or for other reasons.\nHistorically, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range for a variety of reasons, including Company-specific factors and global and industry-wide conditions and events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting recession, as well as the fact that only a few stockholders, in the aggregate, hold more than a majority of our common stock, and, therefore, there is a small public float with limited trading activity in our common stock. In the future, the value of our common stock may be impacted by the amount of our royalty revenues or anticipation thereof, our ability to monetize our remaining assets, including our NOLs, and any unexpected liabilities or expenses that impact our continued operations, our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and the success of any future activities which we undertake, including, but not limited to, our ability to consummate a business acquisition or investment.\nIn addition, equity financings that may be available to us under current market conditions frequently involve sales at prices below the prices at which our common stock currently trades on the OTCQX, as well as the issuance of warrants or convertible equity that require exercise or conversion prices that are calculated in the future at a discount to the then market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQX market of the OTC Markets Group, Inc., which has a very limited trading market and, therefore, market liquidity for our common stock is low and our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares of our common stock may be limited.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQX market of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. and the quotation of our common stock on the OTCQX market does not assure that a liquid trading market exists or will develop. Stocks traded on the OTCQX market generally have very limited trading volume and exhibit a wider spread between the bid/ask quotations than stocks traded on national exchanges. Moreover, a significant number of institutional investors have investment policies that prohibit them from trading in stocks on the OTCQX marketplace. As a result, investors may find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations of the price of, our common stock. This significantly limits the liquidity of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not currently, and are not expected in the future to, meet the listing standards of any national exchange. We presently anticipate that our common stock will continue to be quoted on the OTCQX market. As a result, investors must bear the economic risk of holding their shares of our common stock for an indefinite period of time. In the future, our common stock could become subject to \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers and could further negatively impact market liquidity for our common stock and our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares of our common stock.\nThe declaration of common stock dividends is within the discretion of our Board, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law, as well as the requirements of the Series C Preferred Stock. Our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, our fulfillment of the conditions of the Series C Preferred Stock, fluctuating royalty revenues, our ability to acquire other revenue sources and our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations.\nThe declaration of dividends is within the discretion of our Board, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law, and, therefore, our Board could decide in the future not to declare dividends. In addition, as described elsewhere, our common stock ranks junior to the Series C Preferred Stock, and we cannot declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock unless we satisfy the dividend requirements of such Series C Preferred Stock. Also, our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, our future revenues, including any revenues from existing and any future royalties and/or milestone payments, our ability to acquire other revenue sources and our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations. We expect little or no future royalties from existing previously approved products for which we have the right to receive royalties. In addition, while we intend to acquire or invest in profitable businesses, entities or revenue streams and we may be entitled to a share of milestone and royalty payments from the approval and sale of Vicineum, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so or that we will have sufficient royalty or milestone revenues to be able to pay dividends in the future.\nWe have adopted a Section 382 rights plan, which may discourage a corporate takeover.\nOn August 14, 2020, our Board of Directors adopted a Section 382 rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of our common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 24, 2020. Each share of our common stock issued thereafter will also include one right. Each right entitles its holder, under certain circumstances, to purchase from us one one-thousandth of a share of our Series A-1 Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $1.20 per right, subject to adjustment.\nThe Board adopted the Section 382 rights plan in an effort to protect stockholder value by attempting to protect against a possible limitation on our ability to use our NOLs. We may utilize these NOLs in certain circumstances to offset future United States taxable income and reduce our United States federal income tax liability. Because the Section 382 rights plan could make it more expensive for a person to acquire a controlling interest in us, it could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control even if a change in control was in our stockholders\u2019 interest.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware corporate law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nIn addition to our Section 382 rights plan, provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include:\n\u2022 lack of a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022 the ability of our Board to authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022 advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022 limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.\nThe provisions described above, our Section 382 rights plan and provisions of Delaware corporate law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders, along with the significant amount of common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Icahn, may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then current market price.\nRisks Related to the Series C Preferred Stock\nIn the event of any dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of our Company, we may not be able to make distributions or payments in full to all the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock or, if required, we may not be able to redeem such shares.\nThe Series C Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock, but we may in the future issue one or more series of preferred stock that ranks senior to, junior to or pari passu with our Series C Preferred Stock. In the event of any dissolution, liquidation, winding up or change of control of our Company, we may not be able to make distributions or payments in full to all the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock or, if required, to redeem the Series C Preferred Stock, in which case holders of the Series C Preferred Stock could lose all or a portion of the value of their investment.\nThe dividends on our Series C Preferred Stock can be paid in kind by increasing the liquidation value of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock.\nThe terms of the Series C Preferred Stock allow dividends on the shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be paid in kind by increasing the liquidation value of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock and, therefore, allow the repayment of the initial liquidation value and accrued dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock to be deferred until the earliest of the redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock or upon our dissolution, liquidation or winding up. We may not have enough capital to repay the full amount of the initial liquidation value and accrued dividends if the payment of initial liquidation value and accrued dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock becomes due.\nThe Series C Preferred Stock is equity and is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, and your interests may be diluted in the event we issue additional shares of preferred stock.\nShares of the Series C Preferred Stock represent equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, the Series C Preferred Stock will rank junior to all of our indebtedness and other non-equity claims of our creditors with respect to assets available to satisfy our claims, including in our liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Our future debt may include restrictions on our ability to pay distributions to preferred stockholders. Unlike indebtedness, where principal and interest would customarily be payable on specified due dates, in the case of preferred stock such as the Series C Preferred Stock, dividends are payable only if declared by our Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof). Our ability to pay dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock may be limited by the terms of our agreements governing future indebtedness and by the provisions of other future agreements.\nSubject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law and our charter, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue, from our authorized but unissued shares of capital stock, preferred stock in such classes or series as our Board of Directors may determine and to establish from time to time the number of shares of preferred stock to be included in any such class or series. The issuance of additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock or additional shares of preferred stock designated as ranking on parity with the Series C Preferred Stock would dilute the interests of the holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, and the issuance of shares of any class or series of our capital stock expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series C Preferred Stock or the incurrence of additional indebtedness could affect our ability to pay distributions on, redeem or pay the liquidation preference on the Series C Preferred Stock.\nThe Series C Preferred Stock is not convertible into common stock.\nThe Series C Preferred Stock is not convertible into shares of common stock and, therefore, holders of Series C Preferred Stock have no rights with respect to shares of our common stock. In addition, the Series C Preferred Stock accrues dividends at a fixed rate. Accordingly, an increase in market price of our common stock will not necessarily result in an increase in the value of the Series C Preferred Stock. The value of the Series C Preferred Stock may depend more on dividend and interest rates for other preferred stock, commercial paper and other investment alternatives and our actual and perceived ability to pay dividends on, and in the event of dissolution satisfy the liquidation preference with respect to, the Series C Preferred Stock.\nHolders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock have no voting rights.\nExcept as otherwise provided by law, the holders of Series C Preferred Stock have no special voting rights and their consent will not be required for taking any corporate action. As a result, all matters submitted to stockholders will be decided by the vote of holders of our common stock. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock have no ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that holders of our Series C Preferred Stock do not view as preferable.\nThere is no public market for the Series C Preferred Stock.\nThere is no established public trading market for the Series C Preferred Stock, and we do not expect a market to develop. We do not currently intend to apply for listing of the Series C Preferred Stock on any securities exchange or recognized trading system. Purchasers of the Series C Preferred Stock may be unable to resell their shares of Series C Preferred Stock or sell them only at an unfavorable price for an extended period of time, if at all.", "PERMNO": 33137, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ENZN"}
