{"cik": "1320461", "company": "Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business and financial condition can be impacted by a number of factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of these risks could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent or anticipated results and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are highly dependent on the automotive industry. A prolonged or material contraction in automotive sales and production volumes could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAutomotive sales and production are cyclical and depend on, among other things, general economic conditions and consumer spending, vehicle demand and preferences (which can be affected by a number of factors, including fuel costs, employment levels and the availability of consumer financing). As the volume of automotive production fluctuates, the demand for our products also fluctuates. Prolonged or material contraction in automotive sales and production volume could cause our customers to reduce orders of our products, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our liquidity could be adversely impacted if our customers were to extend their normal payment terms. Likewise, if our suppliers were to reduce normal trade credit terms, our liquidity could be adversely impacted. If either of these situations occurs, we may need to rely on other sources of funding to bridge the additional gap between the time we pay our suppliers and the time we receive corresponding payments from our customers.\nEscalating pricing pressures may adversely affect our business.\nPricing pressure in the automotive supply industry has been substantial and is likely to continue. Nearly all vehicle manufacturers seek price reductions in both the initial bidding process and during the term of the contract. Price reductions have adversely impacted our sales and profit margins and are expected to do so in the future. If we are not able to offset continued price reductions through improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures, those price reductions may have a negative impact on our financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we lose any of our largest customers or significant platforms.\nWhile we provide parts to virtually every major global OEM for use on a multitude of different platforms, sales to our three largest customers, Ford, GM and FCA, on a worldwide basis represented approximately 54% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our ability to reduce the risks inherent in certain concentrations of business will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to diversify our sales on a customer, product, platform and geographic basis. Although business with each customer is typically split among numerous contracts, the loss of a major customer, significant reduction in purchases of our products by such customer, or any discontinuance or resourcing of a significant platform could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and efforts by our competitors to gain market share could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe automotive parts industry is highly competitive. We face numerous competitors in each of our product lines. In general, there are three or more significant competitors and numerous smaller competitors for most of the products we offer. We also face competition for certain of our products from suppliers producing in lower-cost regions such as Asia and Eastern Europe. Our competitors\u2019 efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on the pricing of our products and our margins.\nIncreases in the costs, or reduced availability of, raw materials and manufactured components may adversely affect our profitability.\nRaw material costs can be volatile. The principal raw materials we purchase include EPDM and synthetic rubber, components manufactured from carbon steel, plastic resins, carbon black, process oils, components manufactured from aluminum and natural rubber. Raw materials are the largest component of our costs, representing approximately 50% of our total cost of products sold in 2015. The availability of raw materials and manufactured components can fluctuate due to factors beyond our control. A significant increase in the price of these items, or a restriction in their availability, could materially increase our operating costs and adversely affect our profitability because it is generally difficult to pass through these increased costs to our customers.\nDisruptions in the supply chain could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe obtain components and other products and services from numerous suppliers and other vendors throughout the world. We are responsible for managing our supply chain, including suppliers that may be the sole sources of products that we require, that our customers direct us to use or that have unique capabilities that would make it difficult and/or expensive to re-source. In certain instances, entire industries may experience short-term capacity constraints. Any significant disruption could adversely affect our financial performance. Furthermore, unfavorable economic or industry conditions could result in financial distress within our supply base, thereby increasing the risk of supply disruption. Although market conditions generally have improved in recent years, uncertainty remains, and another economic downturn or other unfavorable industry conditions in one or more of the regions in which we operate could cause a supply disruption and thereby adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIf a customer experiences a material supply shortage, either directly or as a result of a supply shortage at another supplier, that customer may halt or limit the purchase of our products, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to other risks associated with our international operations.\nWe have significant manufacturing operations outside the United States, including joint ventures and other alliances. Our operations are located in 20 countries, and we export to several other countries. In 2015, approximately 73% of our sales were attributable to products manufactured outside the United States. Risks inherent in our international operations include:\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations, currency controls and restrictions, and the ability to hedge currencies;\n\u2022\nchanges in local economic conditions;\n\u2022\nrepatriation restrictions or requirements, including tax increases on remittances and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nglobal sovereign fiscal uncertainty and hyperinflation in certain foreign countries;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations, including export and import restrictions and the imposition of embargos;\n\u2022\nexposure to possible expropriation or other government actions; and\n\u2022\nexposure to local political or social unrest including resultant acts of war, terrorism, or similar events.\nExpanding our sales and manufacturing operations in the Asia Pacific region, particularly in China, is an integral part of our strategy, and, as a result, our exposure to the risks described above is substantial. The occurrence of any of these risks may adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of our international operations and our business as a whole.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially impact our operating results.\nOur sales and manufacturing operations outside the United States expose us to currency risks. Our sales and earnings denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars for our consolidated financial statements. This translation is calculated based on average exchange rates during the reporting period. Our reported international sales and earnings could be adversely impacted in periods of a strengthening U.S. dollar.\nAlthough we generally produce in the same geographic region as our products are sold, we also produce in countries that predominately sell in another currency. Some of our commodities are purchased in or tied to the U.S. dollar; therefore our earnings could be adversely impacted during the periods of a strengthening U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies. We employ financial instruments to hedge certain portions of our foreign currency exposures. However, this will not completely insulate us from the effects of currency fluctuation.\nA portion of our operations are conducted by joint ventures which have unique risks.\nCertain of our operations are carried on by joint ventures. In joint ventures, we share the management of the company with one or more partners who may not have the same goals, resources or priorities as we do. The operations of our joint\nventures are subject to agreements with our partners, which typically include additional organizational formalities as well as requirements to share information and decision making, and may also limit our ability to sell our interest. Additional risks include one or more partners failing to satisfy contractual obligations, a change in ownership of any of our partners and our limited ability to control our partners\u2019 compliance with applicable laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, cash flow or reputation.\nOur capital structure includes a substantial amount of indebtedness, which imposes demands on our liquidity that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or on our ability to obtain financing in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $777.9 million of outstanding indebtedness, including our $750 million senior term loan facility (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d), our $180 million senior asset-based revolving credit facility (\"Senior ABL Facility\") and the debt of certain foreign subsidiaries, which requires principal and interest payments. We are permitted by the terms of the Term Loan Facility and our Senior ABL Facility to incur additional indebtedness, subject to the restrictions therein, which could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the Term Loan Facility and the Senior ABL facility;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and general industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, since the majority of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest; and\n\u2022\nincrease our cost of borrowing.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our debt or to refinance these obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell material assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Term Loan Facility and the Senior ABL Facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries.\nThe Term Loan Facility and the Senior ABL Facility limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness or issue certain disqualified stock and preferred stock;\n\u2022pay dividends or certain other distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022make certain investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022enter into certain restrictive agreements;\n\u2022engage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022guarantee indebtedness; and\n\u2022permit liens.\nMoreover, our Senior ABL Facility provides the agent considerable discretion to impose reserves, which could materially reduce the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to us.\nAs a result of these covenants and restrictions (including borrowing base availability), we are limited in how we conduct our business, and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities or acquisitions. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Senior ABL Facility and under the Term Loan Facility. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders under the Senior ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility and/or amend the covenants in such agreements.\nOur pension plans are currently underfunded, and we may have to make cash payments to the plans, reducing the cash available for our business.\nWe sponsor various pension plans worldwide that are underfunded and will require cash payments. Additionally, if the performance of the assets in our pension plans does not meet our expectations, or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our required contributions may be higher than we expect. As of December 31, 2015, our net underfunded status was $173.3 million. If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our worldwide pension liabilities, it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant changes in discount rates, the actual return on pension assets and other factors could adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense recorded related to our pension plans. Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) require that income or expense related to the pension plans be calculated at the annual measurement date using actuarial calculations, which reflect certain assumptions. Because these assumptions have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate in response to changing market conditions, the amount of gains or losses that will be recognized in subsequent periods, the impact on the funded status of the pension plans and the future minimum required contributions, if any, could adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe benefits of our continuous improvement program and other cost savings plans may not be fully realized.\nOur operations strategy includes continuous improvement programs and implementation of lean manufacturing tools across all facilities to achieve cost savings and increased performance. We have and may continue to initiate restructuring actions designed to improve future profitability and competitiveness. The cost savings that we anticipate from these initiatives may not be achieved on schedule or at the level we anticipate. If we are unable to realize these anticipated savings, our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe may incur significant costs related to manufacturing facility closings or consolidation which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf we must close or consolidate manufacturing locations, the exit costs associated with such closure or consolidation, including employee termination costs, may be significant. Such costs could negatively affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of new program launches could adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn connection with the award of new business, we may obligate ourselves to deliver new products that are subject to our customers\u2019 timing, performance and quality standards. Given the number and complexity of new program launches, we may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness and associated costs. In addition, new program launches require a significant ramp up of costs. However, our sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of our customers\u2019 introduction of new vehicles. Our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of these new program launches could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur success depends in part on our development of improved products, and our efforts may fail to meet the needs of customers on a timely or cost-effective basis.\nOur continued success depends on our ability to maintain advanced technological capabilities and knowledge necessary to adapt to changing market demands as well as to develop and commercialize innovative products. We may be unable to develop new products successfully or to keep pace with technological developments by our competitors and the industry in general. In addition, we may develop specific technologies and capabilities in anticipation of customers\u2019 demands for new innovations and technologies. If such demand does not materialize, we may be unable to recover the costs incurred in such programs. If we are unable to recover these costs or if any such programs do not progress as expected, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAny acquisitions or divestitures we make may be unsuccessful, may take longer than anticipated or may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may pursue acquisitions or divestitures in the future as part of our strategy. Acquisitions and divestitures involve numerous risks, including identifying attractive target acquisitions, undisclosed risks affecting the target, difficulties integrating acquired businesses, the assumption of unknown liabilities, potential adverse effects on existing customer or supplier relationships, and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day business. We may not have, or be able to raise on acceptable terms, sufficient financial resources to make acquisitions. Our ability to make investments may also be limited by the terms of our existing or future financing arrangements. Any acquisitions or divestitures we pursue may not be successful or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow.\nWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty and recall claims that may be brought against us.\nWe may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage.\nAccordingly, we could experience material warranty or product liability expenses in the future and incur significant costs to defend against these claims. In addition, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in a recall of that product if the defect or the alleged defect relates to automotive safety. Product recalls could cause us to incur material costs and could harm our reputation or cause us to lose customers, particularly if any such recall causes customers to question the safety or reliability of our products. Also, while we possess considerable historical warranty and recall data with respect to the products we currently produce, we do not have such data relating to new products, assembly programs or technologies, including any new fuel and emissions technology and systems being brought into production, to allow us to accurately estimate future warranty or recall costs.\nIn addition, the increased focus on systems integration platforms utilizing fuel and emissions technology with more sophisticated components from multiple sources could result in an increased risk of component warranty costs over which we have little or no control and for which we may be subject to an increasing share of liability to the extent any of the other component suppliers are in financial distress or are otherwise incapable of fulfilling their warranty or product recall obligations. Our costs associated with providing product warranties and responding to product recall claims could be material, and we do not have insurance covering product recalls. Product liability, warranty and recall costs may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to a broad range of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a broad range of laws and regulations governing emissions to air; discharges to water; noise and odor emissions; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, reclamation and disposal of chemicals and waste materials; the cleanup of contaminated properties; and health and safety. We may incur substantial costs in complying with these laws and regulations. Many of our current and former facilities have been subject to certain environmental investigations and remediation activities, and we maintain environmental reserves for certain of these sites. Through various acquisitions, we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities, and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership. Material future expenditures may be necessary if compliance standards change or material unknown conditions that require remediation are discovered. Environmental laws could also restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWork stoppages or similar difficulties could disrupt our operations and negatively affect our operations and financial performance.\nWe may be subject to work stoppages and may be affected by other labor disputes. A number of our collective bargaining agreements expire in any given year. There is no certainty that we will be successful in negotiating new agreements with these unions that extend beyond the current expiration dates or that these new agreements will be on terms as favorable to us as past labor agreements. Failure to renew these agreements when they expire or to establish new collective bargaining agreements on terms acceptable to us and the unions could result in work stoppages or other labor disruptions which may have an adverse effect on our operations, customer relationships and financial results. Additionally, a work stoppage at one or more of our suppliers or our customers\u2019 suppliers could adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available. Work stoppages by our customers\u2019 employees could result in reduced demand for our products and could have an adverse effect on our business. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 28% of our employees were represented by unions, and approximately 9% of the unionized employees were located in the U.S. In addition, it is possible that our workforce will become more unionized in the future. Unionization activities could increase our costs, which could negatively affect our profitability.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party challenges our intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe own or have rights to proprietary technology that is important to our business. We rely on intellectual property laws, patents, trademarks and trade secrets to protect such technology. Such protections, however, vary among the countries in which we market and sell our products, and as a result, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without authorization. Any infringement or misappropriation of our technology could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We also face exposure to claims by others for infringement of intellectual property rights and could incur significant costs or losses related to such claims. In addition, many of our supply agreements require us to indemnify our customers from third-party infringement claims. These claims, regardless of their merit or resolution, are frequently costly to prosecute, defend or settle and divert the efforts and attention of our management and employees. If any such claim were to result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to take actions which may include: ceasing the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products; paying substantial damages to third parties, including to customers to compensate them for the\ndiscontinued use of a product or to replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology; or expending significant resources to develop or license non-infringing products, any of which could adversely affect our operations, business and financial condition.\nA disruption in, or the inability to successfully implement upgrades to, our information technology systems, including disruptions relating to cybersecurity, could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nWe rely upon information technology networks, systems and processes to manage and support our business. We have implemented a number of procedures and practices designed to protect against breaches or failures of our systems. Despite the security measures that we have implemented, including those measures to prevent cyber-attacks, our systems could be breached or damaged by computer viruses or unauthorized physical or electronic access. A breach of our information technology systems could result in theft of our intellectual property, disruption to business or unauthorized access to customer or personal information. Such a breach could adversely impact our operations and/or our reputation and may cause us to incur significant time and expense to cure or remediate the breach.\nFurther, we continually update and expand our information technology systems to enable us to more efficiently run our business. If these systems are not implemented successfully, our operations and business could be disrupted and our ability to report accurate and timely financial results could be adversely effected.\nOur expected annual effective tax rate could be volatile and could materially change as a result of changes in many items including mix of earnings, debt and capital structure and other factors.\nMany items could impact our effective tax rate including changes in our debt and capital structure, mix of earnings and many other factors. Our overall effective tax rate is based upon the consolidated tax expense as a percentage of consolidated earnings before tax. However, tax expenses and benefits are not recognized on a consolidated or global basis, but rather on a jurisdictional, legal entity basis. Further, certain jurisdictions in which we operate generate losses where no current financial statement benefit is realized. In addition, certain jurisdictions have statutory rates greater than or less than the United States statutory rate. As such, changes in the mix and source of earnings between jurisdictions could have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate in future years. Changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes, changes in tax laws and rates or adverse outcomes from tax audits that occur regularly in any of our jurisdictions could also have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate in future periods.\nImpairment charges relating to our goodwill, long-lived assets or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe regularly monitor our goodwill, long-lived assets and intangible assets for impairment indicators. In conducting our goodwill impairment testing, we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to the related net book value. In conducting our impairment analysis of long-lived and intangible assets, we compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived or intangible assets to the related net book values. Changes in economic or operating conditions impacting our estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of our goodwill, long-lived assets or intangible assets. In the event that we determine that our goodwill, long-lived assets or intangible assets are impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our total outstanding shares are held by a small number of investors who may, individually or collectively, exert significant control over us, and whose shares may be sold in the future.\nCertain stockholders own a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock. As long as such major stockholders (whether or not acting in a coordinated manner) and any other substantial stockholder own, directly or indirectly, a substantial portion of our outstanding shares, they will be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the composition of our Board of Directors. Further, to the extent that the substantial stockholders were to act in concert, they could potentially control any action taken by our stockholders.\nThe concentration of ownership of our outstanding equity in such major stockholders may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of such stockholders or more likely with the support of such stockholders. The interests of any of such stockholders, any other substantial stockholder or any of their respective affiliates could conflict with or differ from the interests of our other stockholders.\nFurthermore, some of our large shareholders may determine to sell their shares in the future. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock in the market in the future, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our common stock.\nWe operate as a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for cash to satisfy the obligations of the holding company.\nCooper-Standard Holdings Inc. is a holding company. Our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries. In addition, the payment of funds in the form of dividends, intercompany payments, tax sharing payments and otherwise may be subject to restrictions under the laws of the countries of incorporation of our subsidiaries or the by-laws of the subsidiary.", "PERMNO": 14185, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "CPS"}
