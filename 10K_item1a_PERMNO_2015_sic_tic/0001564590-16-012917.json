{"cik": "313927", "company": "CHURCH & DWIGHT CO INC /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-19", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following risks and uncertainties, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report or in other filings by the Company with the Commission, could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition:\n\u00b7\nUnfavorable economic conditions could adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products.\nUnfavorable and uncertain economic conditions have adversely affected, and in the future may adversely affect, demand for some of the categories of products the Company sells, resulting in reduced sales volume or market share or a shift in its product mix from higher margin to lower margin products. Factors that can affect demand include competitors\u2019 products, advertising and pricing actions, rates of unemployment, consumer confidence, health care costs, fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior, including delays in the timing of tax refunds from the federal government, gasoline and home heating oil pricing, reduced unemployment benefits in periods of high unemployment and tax increases. While the vast majority of the Company\u2019s products generally are consumer staples that should be less vulnerable to decreases in discretionary spending than other products, they may become subject to increasing price competition. Moreover, some of the Company\u2019s products, such as laundry additives, gummy dietary supplements and battery-operated toothbrushes, are more likely to be affected by consumer decisions to control spending.\nSome of the Company\u2019s customers, including mass merchandisers, supermarkets, drugstores, convenience stores, wholesale clubs, home stores, and dollar, pet and other specialty stores, have experienced and may experience in the future declining financial performance, which could affect their ability to pay amounts due to the Company on a timely basis or at all. The Company regularly reviews the financial strength of its key customers and, where appropriate, modifies customer credit limits, which may have an adverse impact on future sales. Because the same economic conditions that affect the Company also affect many of the Company\u2019s suppliers, the Company regularly conducts a similar review of its suppliers to assess both their financial viability and the importance of their products to the Company\u2019s operations. When appropriate, the Company identifies alternate sources of materials and services. To date, the Company has not experienced a material adverse impact from economic conditions affecting its customers or suppliers. However, a protracted economic downturn that adversely affects the Company\u2019s suppliers and customers could adversely affect its sales and results of operations.\n\u00b7\nThe Company faces intense competition in its markets, and the failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company faces intense competition from consumer products companies, both in the U.S. and in international markets. Most of the Company\u2019s products compete with other widely-advertised brands within each product category and with private label brands and generic non-branded products of its customers in certain categories, which typically are sold at lower prices.\nThe Company\u2019s products generally compete on the basis of performance, brand recognition, price, value or other benefits to consumers. Consumer products are subject to significant price competition. As a result, the Company may need to reduce the prices for some of its products, or increase prices by an amount that does not cover manufacturing cost increases, to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share. Any reduction in prices, or inability to raise prices sufficiently to cover manufacturing cost increases, would harm profit margins. In addition, if the Company\u2019s sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins, its sales growth and other results of operations would suffer.\nAdvertising, promotion, merchandising and packaging also have a significant impact on retail customer decisions regarding the brands and product lines they sell and on consumer purchasing decisions. A newly introduced consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising, sales promotion and trade merchandising. If a product gains consumer acceptance, it normally requires continued advertising, promotional support and product improvements to maintain its relative market position. If the Company\u2019s advertising, marketing and promotional programs are not effective, its sales growth may decline.\nMany of the Company\u2019s competitors are large companies, including P&G, The Sun Products Corporation, The Clorox Company, Colgate-Palmolive Company, Henkel, Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, Johnson & Johnson, Nestle Purina PetCare Company, Ansell Limited, Alere Inc., Pfizer Inc., Bayer AG, S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., Pharmavite LLC and NBTY, Inc. Many of these companies have greater financial resources than does the Company, and, therefore, have the capacity to outspend the Company on advertising and promotional activities and introduce competing products more quickly and respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than can the Company. In addition, the Company\u2019s competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by it. Competitive activity may require the Company to increase its spending on advertising and promotions and/or reduce prices, which could lead to reduced profits and adversely affect growth. If the Company loses market share or the markets in which it competes do not grow substantially, its sales growth will decline.\n\u00b7Since the introduction in the U.S. of unit dose laundry detergent by various manufacturers, including the Company, there has been significant product and price competition in the laundry detergent category. For example P&G markets a lower-priced line of laundry detergents that competes directly with the Company\u2019s core value laundry detergents and Henkel has entered the U.S. market with Persil, its leading worldwide premium laundry detergent. While it is too early to assess what impact this will have on the premium laundry category or the Company\u2019s laundry detergent business, the introduction of Persil could precipitate greater price competition in the category and distribution pressure with a potential adverse impact on OXICLEAN laundry detergent. While the category grew 1.6% in 2015 after experiencing declines in 2013 and 2014, there is no assurance the category will not decline in the future and that the Company will be able to offset any such decline.\n\u00b7\nLoss of any of its principal customers could significantly decrease the Company\u2019s sales and profitability.\nA limited number of customers account for a large percentage of the Company\u2019s net sales. Wal-Mart is the Company\u2019s largest customer, accounting for approximately 24% of net sales in 2015, 25% of net sales in 2014 and 24% of net sales in 2013. The Company\u2019s top three customers accounted for approximately 35% of net sales in 2015, 36% of net sales in 2014 and 35% of net sales in 2013. The Company expects that a significant portion of its net sales will continue to be derived from a small number of customers and that these percentages may increase if the growth of mass merchandisers continues. As a result, changes in the strategies of Wal-Mart or any of the Company\u2019s other largest customers, including a reduction in the number of brands they carry or of shelf space they dedicate to private label products, could materially harm the Company\u2019s net sales and profitability. In addition, if the Company were to lose a significant customer due to customer service levels or real or perceived product quality or appearance issues, this could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s business is based primarily upon individual sales orders as it rarely enters into long-term contracts with its customers and most customer agreements include customer termination rights after short notice. Accordingly, these customers could reduce their purchasing levels or cease buying products from the Company at any time and for any reason. If the Company loses a significant customer or if sales of its products to a significant customer materially decrease, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u00b7\nChanges in the policies of the Company\u2019s retailer customers and increasing dependence on key retailer customers in developed markets may adversely affect its business.\nIn recent years, the Company has seen increasing retailer consolidation both in the U.S. and internationally. This trend has resulted in the increased size and influence of large consolidated retailer customers, who may demand lower pricing, special packaging or impose other requirements on the Company. These business demands may relate to inventory practices, logistics or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Some of the Company\u2019s customers, particularly its high-volume retail store customers, have sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms. To the extent the Company provides concessions or better trade terms to those customers, its margins are reduced. Further, if the Company is unable to effectively respond to the demands of its customers, these customers could reduce their purchases of Company products and increase their purchases of products from competitors, which would harm the Company\u2019s sales and profitability. In addition, reductions in inventory by the Company\u2019s customers, including as a result of consolidations in the retail industry, or these customers managing their working capital requirements, could result in reduced orders for Company products and adversely affect its results of operations for the financial periods affected by the reductions.\nProtracted unfavorable market conditions have caused many of the Company\u2019s customers to more critically analyze the number of brands they sell, and reduce or discontinue certain of the Company\u2019s product lines, particularly those products that were not number one or two in their category. If this continues to occur and the Company is unable to improve distribution for those products at other customers, its results could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, private label products sold by retail trade chains are typically sold at lower prices than branded products. As consumers look for opportunities to decrease discretionary spending, the Company\u2019s customers have discontinued or reduced distribution of some of its products to encourage those consumers to purchase the customers\u2019 less expensive private label products (primarily in the dietary supplements, diagnostic kits and oral analgesics categories). To the extent customers discontinue or reduce distribution of the Company\u2019s products or these products are adversely affected by customers\u2019 actions to increase shelf space for their private label products, the Company would seek to improve distribution with other customers. However, if the Company\u2019s efforts are not effective, its sales growth and other results, as well as its market share, could be adversely affected.\n\u00b7\nA continued shift in the retail market from food and drug stores to club stores, dollar stores and mass merchandisers, and internet-based retailers could cause the Company\u2019s sales to decline.\nThe Company\u2019s performance depends upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular, and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing and the financial difficulties of the Company\u2019s retailer customers. Consumer products, such as those marketed by the Company, are increasingly being sold by club stores, dollar stores, mass merchandisers and internet-based retailers. Sales of the Company\u2019s products remain strongest in the traditional mass merchandiser, food and drug retail stores, and the Company\u2019s products are also being sold in club stores and dollar stores channels. Although the Company has taken steps to improve, and has seen improvement in, sales to club stores, dollar stores and internet-based retailers, if the current trend continues and the Company is not successful in further improving sales to these channels, its financial condition and operating results could suffer.\n\u00b7\nMarket category declines and changes to the Company\u2019s product and geographic mix may impact the achievement of the Company\u2019s sales growth targets, planned pricing and financial results.\nA significant percentage of the Company\u2019s revenues come from mature markets that are subject to high levels of competition. During 2015, approximately 83% of the Company\u2019s sales were generated in U.S. markets. U.S. markets for consumer products are considered mature and commonly characterized by high household penetration, particularly with respect to the Company\u2019s most significant product categories, such as laundry detergents, deodorizers, household cleaning products, toothpastes, dietary supplements, antiperspirants and deodorants. The Company\u2019s ability to achieve unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increased use of its products by consumers relative to competitors\u2019 products, its ability to drive growth through product innovation in existing and new product categories, investment in its established brands and enhanced merchandising and its ability to capture market share from its competitors. If the Company is unable to increase market share in existing product lines, develop product improvements, undertake sales, marketing and advertising initiatives that expand its product categories and develop, acquire or successfully launch new products, it may not achieve its sales growth objectives. Even if the Company is successful in increasing sales within its product categories, a continuing or accelerating decline in the overall markets for the Company\u2019s products could have a negative impact on its financial results.\n\u00b7\nCost overruns and delays, regulatory requirements, and miscalculations in capacity needs with respect to the Company\u2019s expansion projects and manufacturing facilities could adversely affect its business.\nThe Company initiates expansion projects from time to time. The Company expanded its gummy dietary supplements production capacity at its York, Pennsylvania manufacturing facility to meet expected future product demand. The new gummy dietary supplements line started production in the second quarter of 2015. Projects of this type are subject to risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any large construction project resulting from numerous factors, including the following: shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor; work stoppages; unscheduled delays in the delivery of ordered materials and equipment; unanticipated cost increases; difficulties in obtaining necessary permits or in meeting permit conditions; difficulties in meeting regulatory or quality requirements or obtaining regulatory approvals; availability of suppliers to certify equipment for existing and enhanced regulations; design and engineering problems; and failure or delay of third party service providers, civil unrest and labor disputes. Significant cost overruns or delays in completing a project, or the miscalculations of our anticipated capacity needs could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s return on investment, results of operations and cash flows. In the second quarter of 2015, delays in the Company\u2019s start-up of the new vitamin manufacturing facility resulted in the need to place certain retailers on allocation, which contributed to increased retailer frustration. By the end of the year, these issues were mainly resolved. However, if the Company were to experience similar issues in the future and lose a significant customer or customers, or if sales of any of its products were to materially decrease due to customer service levels or real or perceived product quality or appearance issues, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the supply of the Company\u2019s products depends on the uninterrupted efficient operation of its manufacturing facilities and ability to meet customer service levels. Many of the Company\u2019s manufacturing processes are complex and present difficult technical challenges to obtain the manufacturing yields necessary to operate profitably. In addition, the Company\u2019s manufacturing processes may require complex and specialized equipment which can be expensive to repair or replace with required lead times of up to a year.\nThe manufacturing of certain of the Company\u2019s products is concentrated in one or more of its plants or contract manufacturers, with limited alternate facilities. Any event that negatively impacts manufacturing facilities, manufacturing systems or equipment, or contract manufacturers or suppliers could delay or suspend shipments of products or the release of new products or could result in the delivery of inferior products. The Company\u2019s revenues from the affected products would decline and it could incur losses until such time as the Company or its contract manufacturers are able to restore production processes or are able to put in place alternative contract manufacturers or suppliers.\n\u00b7\nThe Company\u2019s reliance on a limited number of suppliers, including sole source suppliers for certain products, could materially and adversely affect its operations and financial results.\nThe Company relies on a limited number of suppliers for certain of its commodities and raw materials, including sole source suppliers for certain of its raw materials, packaging, product components, finished products and other necessary supplies. New suppliers may have to be qualified under governmental, industry and Company standards, which can require additional investment and time. The Company may be unable to qualify any needed new suppliers or maintain supplier arrangements and relationships; it may be unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity, quality and price levels needed for its business; or certain of the Company\u2019s key suppliers may become insolvent or experience other financial distress. If any of these events occurs and the Company has failed to identify and qualify an alternative vendor, then it may be unable to meet its contractual obligations and customer expectations, which could damage its reputation and result in lost customers and sales, or the Company may incur higher than expected expenses, either of which could materially and adversely affect its business, operations and results of operations.\n\u00b7\nVolatility and increases in the price of raw and packaging materials or energy costs could erode the Company\u2019s profit margins, which could harm operating results, and efforts to hedge against raw material price increases may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results if raw material prices decline.\nThe principal raw materials and packaging used by the Company include surfactants (cleaning agents), paper products and resin-based molded components. Volatility and increases in the price of raw materials, or increases in the costs of energy, shipping and other necessary services, could significantly affect the Company\u2019s profit margins if it is unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies, such as in manufacturing and distribution. Historically, the Company has attempted to address such price increases through cost reduction programs and price increases of its products, entering into pre-buying or locked-in pricing arrangements with certain suppliers and entering into hedge agreements. There is no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to fully offset any price increases, especially given the competitive environment. In addition, volatility in certain commodity markets could significantly affect the Company\u2019s production cost and, therefore, harm its financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company uses hedge agreements to mitigate the volatility of diesel fuel prices. The hedge agreements are designed to add stability to product costs, enabling the Company to make pricing decisions and lessen the economic impact of abrupt changes in prices over the term of the contract. However, in periods of declining fuel prices, the hedge agreements can have the effect of locking the Company in at above-market prices.\n\u00b7\nIf new products and product line extensions do not gain widespread customer acceptance or are otherwise discontinued, or if they cause sales of existing products to decline, the Company\u2019s financial performance could decline.\nThe Company\u2019s future performance and growth depends on its ability to successfully identify, develop and introduce new products and product line extensions. The Company cannot be certain that it will achieve its innovation goals. The successful development and introduction of new products involves substantial research, development, marketing and promotional expenditures, which the Company may be unable to recover if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance. New product development and marketing efforts, including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which the Company has limited or no prior experience, have inherent risks. These risks include product development or launch delays, competitor actions, regulatory approval hurdles and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance. In addition, if sales generated by new products result in a concomitant decline in sales of existing products, the Company\u2019s financial performance could be harmed.\nEach year, the Company introduces new products, including launches into new \u201cwhite space\u201d categories, across the majority of its marketed brands. Historically, new product acceptance has generally been widespread across the retailer base. There is no assurance, however, that the Company\u2019s customers and consumers will continue to purchase these new products. If new products are not successful in generating sales growth, the Company\u2019s financial results could suffer. From time to time, the Company has discontinued certain products and product lines, which resulted in returns from customers, asset write-offs and shutdown costs. The Company may suffer similar adverse consequences in the future to the extent it discontinues products that do not meet retailer or consumer expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand.\n\u00b7\nReduced availability of transportation or disruptions in our transportation network could adversely affect us.\nWe distribute our products and receive raw materials and packaging components primarily by truck, rail and ship and through various ports of entry. Reduced availability of trucking, rail or shipping capacity due to adverse weather conditions, allocation of assets to other industries or geographies or otherwise, work stoppages, strikes or shutdowns of ports of entry or such transportation sources, could cause us to incur unanticipated expenses and impair our ability to distribute our products or receive our raw materials or\npackaging components in a timely manner, which could disrupt our operations, strain our customer relationships and competitive position, and adversely affect our operating profits.\n\u00b7\nIf the reputation of one or more of the Company\u2019s leading brands erodes, its financial results could suffer.\nThe Company\u2019s financial success is directly dependent on the reputation and success of its brands, particularly the ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN, TROJAN, L\u2019IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION brands. The effectiveness of these brands could suffer if the Company\u2019s marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand\u2019s image or its ability to attract consumers. Further, the Company\u2019s results could be adversely affected if one or more of its other leading brands suffers damage to its reputation due to real or perceived quality or safety issues.\nAdditionally, claims made in the Company\u2019s marketing campaigns may become subject to litigation alleging false advertising, which, if successful, could cause the Company to alter its marketing plans and may materially and adversely affect sales or result in the imposition of significant damages against the Company, or other customer or consumer dissatisfaction, especially if such dissatisfaction were to be broadly disseminated, including through the use of social media.\nWidespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination. Negative or inaccurate posting or comments about the Company in the media or on any social networking website, or the disclosure of non-public sensitive information through social media, could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands. In addition, given the association of our individual products with the Company, an issue with one of our products could negatively affect the reputation of our other products, or the Company as a whole, thereby potentially adversely impacting the Company\u2019s financial results.\n\u00b7\nProduct liability claims and withdrawals or recalls could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales and operating results and brand\u2019s reputation.\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to product liability claims. The Company may be required to pay for losses or injuries actually or purportedly caused by its products, including losses or injuries caused by raw materials or other components provided by third party suppliers that are included in the Company\u2019s products. Claims could be based on allegations that, among other things, the Company\u2019s products contain contaminants, are improperly labeled or designed, or provide inadequate instructions regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning interactions with other substances. Whether or not successful, product liability claims could result in negative publicity that could harm the Company\u2019s sales and operating results and the reputation of its brands. In addition, if one of the Company\u2019s products is found to be defective or non-compliant with applicable rules or regulations, it could be required to withdraw or recall it, which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although the Company maintains product liability and product recall insurance coverage (that also covers product withdrawals), potential product liability claims and withdrawal and recall costs may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\n\u00b7\nEnvironmental matters create potential liability risks.\nThe Company must comply with various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates, including those relating to the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances. A release of such substances due to accident or an intentional act could result in substantial liability to governmental authorities or to third parties. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with environmental laws and regulations. For example, the Company currently is subject to environmental regulatory proceedings involving its Brazilian subsidiary, which has been fined the equivalent of approximately $1.0 million (at current exchange rates) and will continue remediation, monitoring and reporting to the Brazilian authorities. It is possible that the Company could become subject to other environmental remediation costs and liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition.\n\u00b7\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in litigation, arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense.\nThe Company, in the ordinary course of its business is, and from time to time may become, the subject of, or party to, various pending or threatened legal actions, government investigations and proceedings from time to time, including, without limitation, those relating to, commercial transactions, product liability, purported consumer class actions, employment matters, antitrust, environmental, health, safety and other compliance related matters. Such proceedings are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of certain pending or threatened legal actions may not be reasonably predictable and any related damages may not be estimable. Certain pending or future legal actions, for example, the matter described under \u201cItem 3 Legal Proceedings - Scantibodies Laboratory, Inc.\u201d below, could\nresult in an adverse outcome for the Company, and any such adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\u00b7\nCurrent and future laws and regulations in the countries in which the company and its suppliers operate could expose the Company to increased costs and other adverse consequences.\nThe manufacturing, processing, formulation (including stability), packaging, labeling, marketing, distribution and sale of the Company\u2019s products are subject to regulation by federal agencies, including the FDA, the FTC, the EPA and the CPSC. In addition, the Company\u2019s and its suppliers\u2019 operations are subject to the oversight of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Labor Relations Board. The Company\u2019s activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states, localities and foreign countries in which its products are sold.\nIn particular, the FDA regulates the formulation, safety, manufacturing, packaging, labeling and distribution of condoms, home pregnancy and ovulation test kits, battery operated toothbrushes, over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements, including vitamins and minerals. The FDA also exercises oversight over cosmetic products such as depilatories. In addition, under a memorandum of understanding between the FDA and the FTC, the FTC has jurisdiction with regard to the promotion and advertising of these products, and the FTC regulates the promotion and advertising of the Company\u2019s other products as well. As part of its regulatory authority, the FDA may periodically conduct inspections of the physical facilities, machinery, processes and procedures that the Company and its suppliers use to manufacture regulated products and may identify compliance issues that would require the Company and its suppliers to make certain changes in its manufacturing facilities and processes. The failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to regulatory action against the products made in that facility, including seizure, injunction or recall, as well as to possible action against the owner of the facility/manufacturer. The Company may be required to make additional expenditures to address these issues or possibly stop selling certain products until the compliance issue has been remediated. As a result, the Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected.\nLikewise, any future determination by the FDA or a similar foreign agency, or by the Company in reviewing its compliance with applicable rules and regulations, that the Company\u2019s products or quality systems do not comply with applicable regulations could result in future compliance activities, including product withdrawals or recalls, import detentions, injunctions preventing the shipment of products, or other enforcement actions. For example, the FDA may determine that a particular claim that the Company uses to support the marketing of a product is not substantiated, may not accept the evidence of safety for a new product that the Company may wish to market, may challenge the safety or effectiveness of existing products based on, among other things, changes in formulations, inadequate stability or \u201cshelf-life,\u201d consumer complaints, or improper labeling, and may determine that the Company\u2019s dietary supplement business manufacturing, packaging, labeling and holding operations do not comply with cGMPs. Similarly, the Company may identify these or other issues in internal compliance reviews of its operations and the operations and products of vendors and acquired companies. These other issues may include the identification of contaminants or non-compliant levels of particular ingredients. Any of the foregoing could subject the Company to adverse publicity, force it to incur unanticipated costs and have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Commission has promulgated federally mandated rules regarding disclosure of the use of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, known as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d, in products manufactured by public companies. Certain of the Company\u2019s products, including its diagnostic test kits and SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes, use these minerals sourced through third parties. The new rules require the Company to conduct due diligence to determine whether such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo (the DRC) or an adjoining country and whether such minerals helped finance the armed conflict in the DRC. The Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs to determine the origin of minerals used in its products. In addition, the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of such minerals used in the Company\u2019s products. Also, the Company may face disqualification as a supplier for customers and reputational challenges, or may need to discontinue supply from its suppliers, if its due diligence procedures do not enable it to verify the origins for the minerals used in its products or determine that the minerals are conflict free.\nFrom time to time, Congress, the FDA, the FTC, the Commission or other federal, state, local or foreign legislative and regulatory authorities may impose additional laws or regulations that apply to the Company, repeal laws or regulations that the Company considers favorable, or impose more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations. The Company is not able to predict the nature of such future laws, regulations, repeals or interpretations or to predict the effect additional governmental regulation, when and if it occurs, would have on its business in the future. Such developments could require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of certain products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, expanded adverse event reporting or other new requirements. Any such developments could increase the Company\u2019s costs significantly and could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u00b7\nThe Company is subject to risks related to its international operations that could adversely affect its results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s international operations subject it to risks customarily associated with foreign operations, including:\n\u00b7\ncurrency fluctuations;\n\u00b7\nimport and export license and taxation requirements and restrictions;\n\u00b7\ntrade restrictions, including local investment or exchange control regulations;\n\u00b7\nchanges in tariffs and taxes, the effect of foreign income taxes, value-added taxes and withholding taxes, including the inability to recover amounts owed to the Company by foreign governments, and the determination of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cI.R.S.\u201d) regarding the applicability of certain regulations, including the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, to the Company\u2019s international transactions;\n\u00b7\nthe possibility of expropriation, confiscatory taxation or price controls;\n\u00b7\nobstacles to repatriating foreign profits back to the U.S.;\n\u00b7\npolitical or economic instability, and civil unrest;\n\u00b7\ndisruptions in the global transportation network, such as work stoppages, strikes or shutdowns of ports of entry or such other transportation sources, or other labor unrest;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with laws and regulations concerning ethical business practices, including without limitation, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and United Kingdom Bribery Act;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nregulatory requirements for certain products; and\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations.\n\u00b7\nchanges to the Company\u2019s cash contributions or other charges with respect to its pension plans covering certain of its international employees;\nThese risks could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to commercialize its products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position. In all foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates, it is subject to laws and regulations that govern foreign investment, foreign trade and currency exchange transactions.\n\u00b7\nThe Company\u2019s business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency fluctuations that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nApproximately 17% of the Company\u2019s net sales were to customers outside the U.S. in 2015. The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk (both transaction and translation) with respect to its sales, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Outside of the U.S., sales and costs are denominated in a variety of currencies, including the Canadian Dollar, Euro, Pound, Brazilian Real, Mexican Peso, Chinese Yuan and Australian Dollar. A weakening of the currencies in which sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease operating profits and cash flow. Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which the Company purchases materials and services in foreign markets. Although the Company, from time to time, enters into forward exchange contracts to reduce the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to anticipated but not yet committed intercompany sales or purchases denominated in the U.S. Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Pound and Euro , foreign currency fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u00b7\nThe failure of the Company to expand in existing geographic locations or enter new geographic locations could have a material adverse effect on the growth of the Company\u2019s business, sales and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to continue to grow its sales and profits is dependent on expanding in the locations in which it already does business and entering into new geographic locations, both of which would require significant resources and investments which would affect the Company\u2019s risk profile. The failure to successfully enter into or expand its business in such locations could materially affect the growth of the Company\u2019s business, sales and results of operations.\n\u00b7\nThe Company may not be able to continue to identify and complete strategic acquisitions and effectively integrate acquired companies to achieve desired financial benefits.\nThe Company seeks to acquire or invest in businesses that offer products, services or technologies that are complementary. The Company has made 10 acquisitions in the past 12 years, including the following brands: SPINBRUSH battery-powered toothbrushes; OXICLEAN, KABOOM and ORANGE GLO cleaning products; ORAJEL oral analgesics; SIMPLY SALINE nasal moisturizers; FELINE PINE natural cat litter; BATISTE dry shampoo; L\u2019IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION dietary supplements; REPHRESH and REPLENS feminine care products; VI-COR, feed ingredients for dairy cows, beef cattle, poultry and other livestock and, in January 2016, TOPPIK, a leading brand of hair building fibers for people with thinning hair. The Company acquired nine of its 10 power brands.\nThe Company may make additional acquisitions or substantial investments in complementary businesses or products in the future. However, the Company may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable strategic acquisitions at attractive valuations, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete future acquisitions. In recent periods, competition from other consumer products companies that are seeking similar opportunities has been particularly strong, and valuations for potential acquisition assets have been high, which has placed pressure on the Company\u2019s ability to identify, structure and execute transactions. In addition, all acquisitions and investments entail various risks, including the difficulty of entering new markets or product categories, the challenges of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products, the potential disruption of the Company\u2019s ongoing business and the ongoing business of the acquired company, the need to review and, if necessary, upgrade processes of the acquired company to conform to the Company\u2019s own processes and applicable legal and regulatory requirements, and, generally, the Company\u2019s potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment. Any of these risks may divert management and other resources, require the Company to incur unanticipated costs or delay the anticipated positive impact on the Company\u2019s business and results of the acquisition. The risks associated with assimilation are increased to the extent the Company acquires businesses that have stand-alone operations that cannot easily be integrated or operations or sources of supply outside of the U.S. and Canada, for which products are manufactured locally by third parties. These factors could harm the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nAcquired companies or operations or newly-created ventures may not be profitable or may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. In addition, future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures, the potentially dilutive issuances of new equity by the Company or the incurrence of additional debt or contingent liabilities, all of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, any potential acquisitions or investments, whether or not ultimately completed, could divert the attention of management and resources from other matters that are critical to the Company\u2019s operations.\n\u00b7\nThe Company relies significantly on information technology. Any inadequacy, interruption, theft or loss of data, malicious attack, integration failure, failure to maintain the security, confidentiality or privacy of sensitive data residing on our systems or other security failure of that technology could harm the Company\u2019s ability to effectively operate its business and damage the reputation of its brands.\nThe Company relies extensively on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, to conduct its business. These systems include, but are not limited to, programs and processes relating to internal communications and communications with other parties, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping product to customers, billing customers and receiving and applying payment, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor, and other stakeholder information and personal data, and other processes necessary to manage the Company\u2019s business. In addition, the Company is engaged in limited e-commerce with respect to its TROJAN brand.\nIncreased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of the information technology systems, networks, and services of the Company, its customers and other business partners, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data of the Company, its customers and other business partners. As a result, the Company\u2019s information technology systems, networks or service providers could be damaged or cease to function properly or the Company could suffer a loss or disclosure of business, personal or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, including catastrophic events, power outages and security breaches. Although the Company has business continuity plans in place and is in process of implementing a breach response plan to address service interruptions, if these plans do not provide effective alternative processes on a timely basis, the Company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct its operations which may adversely affect its business. The Company may need to expend additional resources in the future to continue to protect against, or to address problems caused by any business interruptions or data security breaches.\nAny business interruptions or data security breaches, including cyber security breaches resulting in private data disclosure, could result in lawsuits or regulatory proceedings, damage the Company\u2019s reputation or adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\n\u00b7\nThe Company\u2019s substantial indebtedness and its financial covenants could adversely affect its operations and financial results and prevent it from fulfilling its obligations, and the Company may incur substantially more debt in the future, which could exacerbate these risks.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $1,050 million of total consolidated indebtedness net of debt issuance costs. This amount of indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n\u00b7\nmaking it more difficult for the Company to satisfy its cash obligations;\n\u00b7\nlimiting the Company\u2019s ability to fund potential acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nrequiring the Company to dedicate a portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of cash flow to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimiting the Company\u2019s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, general adverse economic conditions or changes in its business and the industry in which it operates; and\n\u00b7\nplacing the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s credit facility is subject to certain financial and other customary covenants. In the event of a breach of those covenants, our lenders under the credit facility may be entitled to accelerate the related debt (and any lenders in respect of any other debt to which a cross-default provision applies may be entitled to accelerate such other debt), and we could be required to seek amendments or waivers under the debt instruments or to refinance the debt.\nIn addition, the Company may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to fund acquisitions, to repurchase shares or to fund other activities for general business purposes. If new debt is added to the current debt levels, the related risks that the Company now faces could intensify. Any decision regarding future borrowings will be based on the facts and circumstances existing at the time, including market conditions and the Company\u2019s credit rating.\n\u00b7\nThe Company may not have sufficient cash flow to service its indebtedness or fund capital expenditures.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to repay and refinance its indebtedness and to fund capital expenditures depends primarily on its cash flow. Cash flow is often subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, and such factors may limit its ability to repay indebtedness and fund capital expenditures. A failure to service its indebtedness or obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\n\u00b7\nThere can be no guarantee that the Company will continue to make dividend payments or repurchase the Common Stock at sustained levels or at all.\nAlthough the Board has recently authorized new share repurchase programs and recently increased the amount of the quarterly cash dividends payable on the Common Stock, any Board determinations to continue to repurchase the Common Stock or to continue to pay cash dividends on the Common Stock, in each case at levels consistent with recent practice or at all, will be based primarily upon the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, business requirements, price of the Common Stock in the case of the repurchase programs, and the Board\u2019s continuing determination that the repurchase programs and the declaration of dividends under the dividend policy are in the best interests of Company stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the repurchase and dividend programs. In the event the Company does not declare a quarterly dividend, or discontinues its share repurchases, its stock price could be adversely affected.\n\u00b7\nRecent volatility in the financial markets may negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to access the credit markets.\nIn recent years, the banking system and financial markets have experienced severe disruption, including, among other things, bank failures and consolidations, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades, declines in asset valuations and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These conditions present the following risks to the Company, among others:\n\u00b7\nThe Company is dependent on the continued viability of the financial institutions that participate in the syndicate that is generally obligated to fund the Company\u2019s $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility dated December 4, 2015 (as\namended, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). In addition, the Credit Agreement includes a \u201ccommitment increase\u201d feature that enables the Company to increase the amount of its borrowing under the Credit Agreement, subject to lending commitments and certain conditions. Any disruption in the credit markets could limit the availability of credit or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend credit, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity and capital resources.\n\u00b7\nThe Company\u2019s short- and long-term credit ratings affect its borrowing costs and access to financing. A downgrade in the Company\u2019s credit ratings would increase its borrowing costs and could affect its ability to issue commercial paper. Disruptions in the commercial paper market or other effects of volatile economic conditions on the credit market also could raise the Company\u2019s borrowing costs for both short- and long-term debt offerings. Either scenario could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity and capital resources. Failure to maintain the Company\u2019s credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate in future financings, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.\nAlthough the Company believes that its operating cash flows, together with its access to the credit markets, provides it with significant discretionary funding capacity, the inability of one or more institutions to fulfill funding obligations under the Credit Agreement could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity and operations.\n\u00b7\nChanges in tax laws and regulations or in the Company\u2019s operations may impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate and may adversely affect its earnings and cash flow.\nThe Company\u2019s future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, or changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The realization of deferred income tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded if it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. If the actual amount of the Company\u2019s future taxable income is less than the amount it is currently projecting with respect to specific tax jurisdictions, or if there is a change in the time period within which the deferred tax asset becomes deductible, the Company could be required to record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. The recording of a valuation allowance would result in an increase in the Company\u2019s effective tax rate, and would have an adverse effect on its operating results. In addition, changes in statutory tax rates may change the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets or liability balances, which would have either a favorable or unfavorable impact on its effective tax rate.\n\u00b7\nResolutions of tax disputes may adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings and cash flow.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the Company\u2019s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions. The Company provides for uncertain tax positions with respect to tax positions that do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards mandated by applicable accounting guidance. Fluctuations in federal, state, local and foreign taxes or changes to uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, may impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate and its financial results. The Company is regularly under audit by tax authorities, and although the Company believes its tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation could be materially different than that reflected in its historical income tax provisions and accruals. In addition, when particular tax matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the Company\u2019s effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Unfavorable resolution of any tax matter could increase the effective tax rate. Any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.\n\u00b7\nFailure to effectively utilize or successfully assert intellectual property rights, and the loss or expiration of such rights, could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s competitiveness. Infringement by the Company of third-party intellectual property rights could result in costly litigation and/or the modification or discontinuance of Company products.\nThe market for the Company\u2019s products depends to a significant extent upon the value associated with its trademarks and brand names, including ARM & HAMMER, TROJAN, OXICLEAN, L\u2019IL CRITTERS and VITAFUSION. The Company owns the material trademarks and brand names used in connection with the marketing and distribution of its major products both in the U.S. and in other countries. In addition, the Company holds several valuable patents on its products, which the Company believes serve as an effective barrier to entry for new competitors. Accordingly, the Company relies on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect its intellectual property rights. Although most of the Company\u2019s material intellectual property is registered in the U.S. and in certain foreign countries in which it operates, it cannot be sure that its intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized or, if necessary, successfully asserted. There is a risk that the Company will not be able to obtain and perfect its own intellectual property rights, or, where appropriate, license from others intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. The Company cannot be sure that these rights, if obtained, will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future, and the Company could incur significant costs in connection with legal actions relating to such rights. In addition, even if such rights are obtained in the U.S., the laws of some of the other countries in which the Company\u2019s products are or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. If other parties infringe the Company\u2019s intellectual property\nrights, they may dilute the value of the Company\u2019s brands in the marketplace, which could diminish the value that consumers associate with the Company\u2019s brands and harm its sales. The Company\u2019s failure to perfect or successfully assert intellectual property rights could make it less competitive and could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results and financial condition. Also, the Company\u2019s patents are granted for a term of 20 years from the date the patent application is filed. While the Company considers no single patent to be material to the business as a whole, it does recognize that the loss of key patents will allow for increased competition, specifically to its SPINBRUSH battery-powered toothbrush, FIRST RESPONSE pregnancy test kit and ANSWER pregnancy test kit brands. While the Company has obtained and is seeking patent protection for improvements made in these product areas, the Company cannot provide assurance that its patents on such improvements will offer the same level of protection from competition as the patents that are nearing the end of their 20 year terms and expiring.\nIn addition, if the Company\u2019s products are found to infringe intellectual property rights of others, the owners of those rights could bring legal actions against the Company claiming substantial damages for past infringement and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected products. If these legal actions are successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages from past infringement, the Company could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products, potentially adding significant costs. The Company might not prevail in any action brought against it or it may be unsuccessful in securing any license for continued use and therefore have to discontinue the marketing and sale of a product. This could make the Company less competitive and could have a material adverse impact on its business, operating results and financial condition.\n\u00b7\nImpairment of the Company\u2019s goodwill and other intangible assets may result in a reduction in net income.\nThe Company has a material amount of goodwill, trademarks and other intangible assets, as well as other long-lived assets, which are periodically evaluated for impairment in accordance with current accounting standards. Declines in the Company\u2019s profitability and/or estimated cash flows related to specific intangible assets, as well as potential changes in market valuations for similar assets and market discount rates, has resulted in impairment charges from time to time, and may result in future impairment charges, which could reduce the Company\u2019s net income and otherwise have an adverse impact on operating results. In 2014, the results of the Company\u2019s annual impairment test for indefinite lived trade names resulted in a personal care trade name whose fair value exceeded its carrying value by 11%. In 2015, the fair value of this asset exceeded its carrying value by approximately 20%, based on improved and forecasted performance. This trade name\u2019s carrying value is approximately $37 million as of December 31, 2015, and is considered an important asset to the Company. The Company continues to monitor performance and should there be any significant change in forecasted assumptions or estimates, including sales, profitability and discount rate, the Company may be required to recognize an impairment charge.\n\u00b7\nThe Company\u2019s operations and the operations of its third party manufacturers, suppliers and customers may be subject to disruption from events beyond its or their control.\nThe Company\u2019s operations, as well as the operations of its third party manufacturers, suppliers and customers, may be subject to disruption from a variety of causes, including work stoppages, material shortages, financial difficulties, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, fire, earthquake, flooding or other natural disasters. If a major disruption were to occur, it could result in harm to people or the natural environment, delays in shipments of products to customers or suspension of operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\n\u00b7\nThe Company may not be able to attract, retain and develop key personnel.\nThe Company\u2019s future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of its executive officers and other key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. This effect could be exacerbated if any officers or other key personnel left as a group or at the same time. The Company\u2019s success also depends, in part, on its continuing ability to attract, retain and develop highly qualified personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that the Company can retain its key employees or attract, assimilate and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future.", "PERMNO": 23393, "SIC": 2840, "TIC": "CHD"}
