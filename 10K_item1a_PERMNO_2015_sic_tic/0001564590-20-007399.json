{"cik": "1080709", "company": "ARENA PHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvestment in our stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks described below, together with other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other public filings, before making investment decisions regarding our stock. If any of the following events actually occur, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. Moreover, the risks described below are not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nDrug development programs are expensive, time consuming, uncertain and susceptible to change, interruption, delay or termination.\nDrug development programs are very expensive, time consuming and difficult to design and implement. Our drug candidates are in various stages of clinical and preclinical development and are prone to the risks of failure inherent in research and development. Clinical trials and preclinical studies are needed to demonstrate that drug candidates are safe and effective to the satisfaction of the FDA, and similar non-US regulatory authorities, and the FDA or other regulatory authority may require us to, or we or others may decide to, conduct additional research and development even after a drug is approved. The commencement or completion of our clinical trials or preclinical studies could be substantially delayed or prevented by several factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nlimited number of, and competition for, suitable patients required for enrollment in our clinical trials or animals to conduct our preclinical studies;\n\u2022\nlimited number of, and competition for, suitable sites to conduct our clinical trials or preclinical studies;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to obtain a meeting, approval or agreement from the applicable regulatory authority to commence a clinical trial or approve a study protocol;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to obtain sufficient supplies of drug candidates, drugs or other materials for the trial or study;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to reach agreement on acceptable agreement terms or protocols; and\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to obtain institutional review board, or IRB, approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site.\nFor example, recruitment for the indications in our ongoing and planned clinical studies is competitive and challenging, and it is difficult to predict when such trials will be fully enrolled or when data will be available, if at all.\nIn addition, the FDA, other regulatory authorities, collaborators, or we may suspend, delay or terminate our development programs at any time for various reasons, including those listed above affecting the commencement or completion of trials and the following:\n\u2022\nside effects experienced by study participants or other safety issues;\n\u2022\nlack of effectiveness of any drug candidate during clinical trials;\n\u2022\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment or lower than expected patient retention rates;\n\u2022\ninadequacy of or changes in the manufacturing process or compound formulation;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approvals to commence a study, or \u201cclinical holds,\u201d or delays requiring suspension or termination of a study by a regulatory authority, such as the FDA, after a study is commenced;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable regulatory policies and regulations;\n\u2022\ndelays in identifying and reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding proper dosing;\n\u2022\nunfavorable results from clinical trials or preclinical studies, including those conducted by us, our partners or our licensees;\n\u2022\nfailure of our clinical research organizations to comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements or otherwise perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner;\n\u2022\nscheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions;\n\u2022\nfailure to design appropriate clinical trial protocols;\n\u2022\ninsufficient data to support regulatory approval;\n\u2022\ntermination of clinical trials at one or more clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ninability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols;\n\u2022\nfailure of participating clinicians and clinical institutions to comply with all legal, regulatory and contractual requirements or otherwise perform in a timely or acceptable manner;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining contact with subjects during or after treatment, which may result in incomplete data;\n\u2022\nlack of sufficient funding to continue clinical trials or preclinical studies; or\n\u2022\nchanges in business priorities or perceptions of the value of the program.\nThere is typically a high rate of attrition from the failure of drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials, and many companies have experienced significant setbacks in advanced development programs even after promising results in earlier studies or trials. We have experienced setbacks in our internal and partnered development programs and expect to experience additional setbacks from time to time in the future. In addition, even if the earlier-stage results of our development programs are favorable, these programs may take significantly longer than expected to complete or may not be completed at all. If we or our collaborators abandon or are delayed in our development efforts related to any drug or drug candidate, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to continue our operations at the current or planned level or be profitable, our reputation in the industry and in the investment community would likely be significantly damaged, additional funding may not be available to us or may not be available on terms we or others believe are favorable, and our stock price may decrease significantly.\nWe may not be successful in initiating, enrolling patients in, or completing our studies or trials or advancing our programs on our projected timetable, if at all. Any failure to initiate or delays in our studies, trials or development programs, or unfavorable results or decisions or negative perceptions regarding any of our programs, could cause our stock price to decline significantly. This is particularly the case with respect to our clinical programs.\nWe will need to obtain additional funds or enter into collaboration agreements to execute on our corporate strategy, and we may not be able to do so at all or on terms you view as favorable; your ownership may be substantially diluted if we do obtain additional funds; you may not agree with the manner in which we allocate our available resources; and we may not be profitable.\nIt takes many years and potentially hundreds of millions of dollars to successfully develop a compound into a marketed drug. We have accumulated a large deficit that has primarily resulted from the significant expenditures we have made in research and development since our inception. We expect that our losses and operating expenses will continue to be substantial.\nAll of our internal programs are in the development stage, and we may not have adequate funds to develop all of our compounds into marketed drugs.\nWe may seek to obtain additional funding through the capital markets or other financing sources. Additional funding may not be available to us or may not be available on terms we or others believe are favorable. Our ability to obtain additional funding may depend on many factors, including those outside our control. Should we obtain additional funding, your ownership interest may be diluted or otherwise negatively impacted.\nWe have entered into, and may in the future seek to enter into, collaboration or other agreements with other entities to continue to develop and, if successful, commercialize one or more of our drug candidates. We may not be able to enter into any such agreements on terms that we or third parties, including investors or analysts, view as favorable, if at all. Our ability to enter into any such agreement for any of our programs or drug candidates depends on many factors, potentially including the outcomes of additional testing (including clinical trial results) or regulatory applications for marketing approval, and we do not control these outcomes.\nWe may allocate our resources in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our assets, and our stockholders and others may also not agree with the manner in which we choose to allocate our resources or obtain additional funding. We may also eliminate, scale back or delay some or all of our research and development programs, and any such reductions or failure to apply our resources effectively or to obtain additional funding could narrow, slow or otherwise adversely impact the development and commercialization of one or more of our drug candidates, which could reduce our opportunities for success and have a material adverse effect on our business, our prospects and the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, we cannot assure you that we will be profitable or, if we are profitable for any particular time period, that we will be profitable in the future.\nOur business may be negatively impacted based on the clinical trials and preclinical studies of, and decisions affecting, one or more of our drug candidates.\nThe results and timing of clinical trials and preclinical studies obtained by us or our collaborators or licensees, as well as related decisions by us, collaborators, licensees and regulators, can affect our stock price. Results of clinical trials and preclinical studies are uncertain and subject to different interpretations by regulatory agencies, us or others. The design of these trials and studies (which may change significantly and be more expensive than anticipated depending on results and regulatory decisions), as well as related analyses of such results, including adverse effects, may not be viewed favorably by us or third parties, including investors, analysts,\ncurrent or potential collaborators, the academic and medical communities, and regulators, which could adversely impact the development and opportunities for regulatory approval of drug candidates and commercialization (and even result in withdrawal from the market) of approved drugs. The same may be true of decisions regarding the focus and prioritization of our research and development efforts. Stock prices of companies in our industry have declined significantly when such results and decisions were unfavorable or perceived negatively or when a drug candidate or product did not otherwise meet expectations.\nThe development, approval or commercialization of any of our drug candidates could be negatively affected by circumstances related to other drug candidates or approved products.\nInformation on our drug candidates in clinical development is preliminary and incomplete, and for such drug candidates, particularly in the earlier stages of development, information on approved products in the same or related drug classes may indicate potential risks related to the development of our drug candidates. In particular, safety issues affecting other drugs or drug candidates may result in increased regulatory scrutiny of the safety of our drugs or drug candidates, may raise potential adverse publicity and may affect product sales or result in litigation. For example, etrasimod is an orally available modulator of the S1P receptors. An approved drug that is also an orally available modulator of the S1P receptors, Gilenya, is associated with risks such as adverse cardiovascular effects, including lowering of the heart rate and heart blocks, infection, macular edema, respiratory effects, fetal risk, a rare brain infection, and elevations in liver enzymes. These adverse reactions and risks may be associated with S1P receptor modulation and could be found to be associated with the use of etrasimod. Such adverse reactions and risks, either actual or perceived, could negatively impact the development, approval or commercialization of etrasimod, or our ability to enter into a collaboration on acceptable terms.\nTopline data may not accurately reflect the complete results of a particular study or trial.\nWe may publicly disclose topline or interim data from time to time, which are based on a preliminary analysis of then-available efficacy and safety data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial.\nWe also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimations, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular drug candidate or drug and our company in general. In addition, the information we may publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you, regulators or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular drug, drug candidate or our business.\nOur hypothesis that selectively targeting receptors can lead to more efficacious or safer drugs may not be correct.\nIn general, we have designed and optimized the drug candidates that we or our collaborators and licensees are developing (including etrasimod, olorinab, APD418 and ralinepag) to selectively target certain receptors found on cells in humans. Our hypothesis is that selectivity may allow our drug candidates to address diseases more efficaciously or without some of the negative effects associated with less selective drugs. In certain cases, we believe early research and, if available, early clinical testing, provides preliminary support for our hypothesis. However, our hypothesis may not be correct, early research and early phase clinical testing may not be predictive of efficacy or safety in later trials, and our drug candidates may not be approved or, if approved, have the desired efficacy or safety profile.\nIt is generally our strategy to develop drug candidates that we believe will be first-in-class, best-in-class, or similar descriptions, or otherwise have broad clinical utility, optimized pharmacology or optimized pharmacokinetics. Some or all of our drug candidates may not achieve these goals. For example, failure to complete enrollment in clinical trials on schedule or at all could prevent a drug candidate from being first-in-class. Similarly, comparing data from different trials, or making predictions based on preclinical data, may not allow us to correctly determine whether our drug candidates are superior to competitive drugs or drug candidates in the same way that comparisons can be made from conducting trials in which our and a competitive drug is tested \u201chead to head\u201d in the same trial. The failure of our drugs or drug candidates to be first-in-class, best-in-class, or similar descriptions, or have broad clinical utility, optimized pharmacology, or optimized pharmacokinetics, or a lack of \u201chead to head\u201d data, could adversely affect development, regulatory approval, third-party payor support, or market adoption, which would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe results of preclinical studies and completed clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and our current drug candidates or any approved drugs may not be further developed or have favorable results in later studies or trials.\nPreclinical studies and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials are not primarily designed to test the efficacy of a drug candidate, but rather to test safety, to study pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and to understand the drug candidate\u2019s side effects at various doses and schedules. Favorable results in early studies or trials may not be confirmed in later studies or trials, including preclinical studies that continue or that are initiated after earlier clinical trials and large-scale clinical trials, and our drug candidates or drugs in subsequent trials or studies may fail to show desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through earlier-stage trials. For example, we have announced positive topline Phase 2 results for etrasimod in patients with ulcerative colitis, but these results may not be confirmed in any subsequent Phase 3 study. By way of another example, the impact of etrasimod on heart rate that was observed in completed clinical trials may not be observed in subsequent trials, and it could be viewed negatively by the FDA or other regulatory agencies.\nUnfavorable results from clinical trials or preclinical studies could result in delays, modifications or abandonment of ongoing or future clinical trials, or abandonment of a program. Clinical and preclinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals or commercialization. Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during such trials or studies could cause a clinical trial to be delayed, repeated or terminated; a program to be abandoned; or negatively impact a related marketed drug, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign authorities. Results of our trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of these or other side effects. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nAdditionally, if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nDrug discovery and development is intensely competitive in the therapeutic areas on which we focus. If the number of our competitors increase or they develop treatments that are approved faster, marketed better, less expensive or demonstrated to be more effective or safer than our drugs or drug candidates, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.\nMany of the drugs we or our collaborators are attempting or may attempt to discover and develop may compete with existing therapies in the United States and other territories. In addition, many companies are pursuing the development of new drugs that target the same diseases and conditions that we target. For example, with regard to etrasimod, there are other drugs that have a similar mechanism of action that entered Phase 3 clinical development before etrasimod for the same indications that we are pursuing, such as ulcerative colitis.\nOur competitors, particularly large pharmaceutical companies, may have substantially greater research, development and marketing and sales capabilities and greater financial, scientific and human resources than we do. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory agency approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before we do for the same indication may achieve a significant competitive advantage, including certain patent and marketing exclusivity rights. In addition, our competitors\u2019 drugs may have fewer side effects, more desirable characteristics (such as efficacy, route of administration or frequency\nof dosing), or be viewed more favorably by patients, healthcare providers, healthcare payers, the medical community, the media or others than our drug candidates or drugs, if any, for the same indication. Our competitors may also market generic or other drugs that compete with our drugs at a lower price than our drugs, which may negatively impact our drug sales, if any. Any results from our research and development efforts, or from our joint efforts with our existing or any future collaborators, may not compete successfully with existing or newly discovered products or therapies.\nOur revenues in the future will be substantially dependent on the success of our or our collaborators\u2019 and licensees\u2019 marketing of drugs we have discovered or developed. To the extent such drugs are not commercially successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected, and the price of our common stock may decline.\nWe believe our revenues will be substantially dependent on the success of the drugs we or our collaborators and licensees successfully develop. We do not know whether or when such drug candidates will be approved by regulatory authorities for sale or commercialized. Even if approved and commercialization begins, we do not know if such commercialization will be successful or otherwise meet our, your, analysts\u2019 or others\u2019 expectations, and the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. For example, sales of lorcaserin to date have been less than we and others initially anticipated, and, in February 2020, Eisai (as well as its distributor in South Korea) determined to withdraw lorcaserin (commercialized as BELVIQ and BELVIQ XR) from the market based on concerns raised by the FDA.\nWe cannot guarantee future product sales or achievement of milestones under our collaborations and license agreements. For example, our license agreement with United Therapeutics for ralinepag does not contain a covenant obligating United Therapeutics to use any particular efforts to develop or commercialize any product, and we may never receive any milestone or royalty payments under this license agreement. In addition, our collaboration and license agreements, may be terminated in certain circumstances, which may result in us not receiving additional milestone or other payments under the terminated agreement.\nThe degree of market acceptance and commercial success of a drug will depend on a number of factors, including the following, as well as risks identified in other risk factors:\n\u2022\nthe number of patients treated with the drug and their results;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance and use of the drug, which may depend on the public\u2019s awareness and view of the drug, economic changes, national and world events, potentially seasonal and other fluctuations in demand, the timing and impact of current or new competition, and the drug\u2019s perceived advantages or disadvantages over alternative treatments (including relative convenience, ease of administration, and prevalence and severity of any adverse events, including any unexpected adverse events);\n\u2022\nthe actual and perceived safety and efficacy of the drug on both a short- and long-term basis among actual or potential patients, healthcare providers and others in the medical community, regulatory agencies and insurers and other payers, including related decisions by any such entity or individual;\n\u2022\nincidence and severity of any side effects, including as a result of off-label use or in combination with one or more drugs;\n\u2022\nnew data relating to the drug, including as a result of additional studies, trials or analyses of the drug or related drugs or drug candidates, whether conducted by us or by others;\n\u2022\nphysicians\u2019 awareness of the drug, and the willingness of physicians to prescribe and of patients to use the drug;\n\u2022\nthe claims, limitations, warnings and other information in the drug\u2019s current or future labeling;\n\u2022\nany current or future scheduling designation for the drug by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, or any comparable foreign authorities;\n\u2022\nour or our collaborators\u2019 maintenance of an effective sales force, marketing team, strategy and program, and medical affairs group and related functions, as well as its sales, marketing and other representatives accurately describing the drug consistent with its approved labeling;\n\u2022\nthe price and perceived cost-effectiveness of the drug, including as compared to possible alternatives;\n\u2022\nthe ability of patients and physicians and other providers to obtain and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement, if any, by third-party payers, including government payers;\n\u2022\nthe ability and desire of group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, including distributors and other network providers, to sell the drug to their constituencies;\n\u2022\nintroduction of counterfeit or unauthorized versions of the drug;\n\u2022\nto the extent the drug is approved and marketed in a jurisdiction with a significantly lower price than in another jurisdiction, the impact of the lower pricing in the higher-priced territory, including on the pricing of reimbursement, if available, and by the diversion of lower-priced of the drug into the higher-priced territory; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of adequate commercial manufacturing and supply chain for the drug.\nOur drugs may not be commercially successful if not widely covered and adequately reimbursed by third-party payers, and we may depend on others to obtain and maintain third-party payer access; inadequate third-party coverage and reimbursement could make entering into agreements with pharmaceutical companies to collaborate or commercialize our drugs more difficult and diminish our revenues.\nOur and our collaborators\u2019 and licensee\u2019s ability to successfully commercialize any of our drugs that have been or may be approved will depend, in part, on government regulation and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, including private health insurers and government payers, such as the Medicaid and Medicare programs, increases in government-run, single-payer health insurance plans and compulsory licenses of drugs. We expect government and third-party payers will continue their efforts to contain healthcare costs by limiting coverage and reimbursement levels for new drugs. In addition, many countries outside of the U.S. have nationalized healthcare systems in which the government pays for all such products and services and must approve product pricing, and some U.S. politicians advocate for implementation of a comparable system in the United States. A government or third-party payer decision not to approve pricing, or provide adequate coverage and reimbursements, for our drugs, if any, could limit market acceptance of and demand for our drugs.\nIt is increasingly difficult to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement levels from third-party payers, and significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement of newly approved prescription drug products. We or our collaborators also face competition in negotiating for coverage from pharmaceutical companies and others with competitive drugs or other treatment, and these competitors may have significantly more negotiating leverage or success with respect to individual payers than we or our collaborators may have.\nFederal and state healthcare reform measures that have been or may be implemented in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria, more limited coverage and downward pressure on the price that we may receive for any approved product, which could seriously decrease our future revenues. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, or the ACA, which was enacted in 2010, is one such healthcare reform measure that has made a number of substantial changes in the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. In the years since its enactment, there have been, and continue to be, significant developments in, and continued legislative, executive, and judicial activity around, attempts to repeal, replace, or modify the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d. In December 2018, the United States Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, published a new final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress as part of the TCJA. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. It is unclear how this decision, future decisions, subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business and operations.\nFurther, the Trump administration\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 includes a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. The Trump administration previously released a \u201cBlueprint\u201d to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has solicited feedback on some of these measures and has implemented others under its existing authority. While some measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that they will\ncontinue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nIn addition, there has been heightened scrutiny in the United States and other countries of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. In the United States, such scrutiny has resulted in congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of additional cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may also limit our commercial opportunities by reducing the amount a potential collaborator or licensee is willing to pay to license our programs or drug candidates in the future, which may prevent us from being able to establish and maintain collaborations and license agreements, generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.\nForecasting potential sales for drugs will be difficult, and if our projections are inaccurate, our business may be harmed and our stock price may be adversely affected.\nOur business planning requires us to forecast or make assumptions regarding demand and revenues for our drugs if they are approved despite numerous uncertainties. These uncertainties may be increased if we rely on our collaborators to conduct commercial activities and provide us with accurate and timely information. Actual results may deviate materially from projected results for various reasons, including the following, as well as risks identified in other risk factors:\n\u2022\nthe rate of adoption in the particular market, including fluctuations in demand for various reasons, such as fluctuations related to economic changes, national and world events, holidays and seasonal changes;\n\u2022\npricing (including discounting or other promotions), reimbursement, product returns or recalls, competition, labeling, DEA scheduling, adverse events and other items that impact commercialization;\n\u2022\nlack of patient and physician familiarity with the drug;\n\u2022\nlack of patient use and physician prescribing history;\n\u2022\nlack of commercialization experience with the drug;\n\u2022\nactual sales to patients may significantly differ from expectations based on sales to wholesalers;\n\u2022\nuncertainty relating to when the drug may become commercially available to patients and rate of adoption in other territories; and\n\u2022\nother changes in regulatory or commercial conditions.\nRevenues from drug sales may be based in part on estimates, judgment and accounting policies, and incorrect estimates or regulators\u2019 or others\u2019 disagreement regarding such estimates or accounting policies may result in changes to guidance, projections or previously reported results. Expected and actual product sales and quarterly and other results may greatly fluctuate, and such fluctuations can adversely affect the market price of our common stock, perceptions of our ability to forecast demand and revenues, and our ability to maintain and fund our operations.\nOur efforts will be seriously jeopardized if we are unable to attract and retain key and other employees.\nOur success depends on the continued contributions of our principal management, development and scientific personnel, and the ability to hire and retain key and other personnel. We face competition for such personnel, and we believe that risks and uncertainties related to our business may impact our ability to hire and retain key and other personnel. If we do not recruit and retain effective management and other key employees, particularly our executive officers, our operations, our ability to generate or raise additional capital, and our business in general, may be adversely impacted. For example, to execute our clinical programs, our strategy is to maintain a sufficient and robust program management function with clinical expertise. We are in the process of modifying and building this function, and we may not be able to establish the function we believe necessary to support our clinical goals and meet our corporate objectives.\nWe are expanding our organization and may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe are seeking to expand our employee base to increase our managerial, scientific, operational, manufacturing supply, commercial, financial and other resources and to hire more consultants and contractors, including in and outside of headquarters in San Diego, California. For example, in addition to our headquarters in San Diego, we currently have operations in Boston, Massachusetts and Zug, Switzerland. Future growth will impose significant additional responsibilities on our management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees, consultants and contractors. Also, our management may need to divert attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our future growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. Moreover, if our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to develop and then commercialize any approved products and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.\nData generated or analyzed with respect to product use in the market or required postmarketing or other studies or trials may result in decreased demand, lower sales, product recall, regulatory action or litigation.\nAn NDA holder (or the equivalent outside the United States) is responsible for assessing and monitoring the safety of a drug that has been approved for marketing, including reviewing reports of adverse safety events. In addition, NDA holders often conduct additional studies or trials or analyze new or previous data related to an approved drug, including with respect to required postmarketing studies and in connection with seeking additional regulatory approvals in new territories.\nAny new data generated, including from adverse event reports or required postmarketing, registration or other studies or trials, may result in label changes, adversely affect sales or development, result in withdrawal of the drug from the market, or result in litigation. In addition, analyses of previous data can have similar risks. Regulatory agencies may consider the new data or analyses in reviewing marketing applications for drug candidates in their territories or impose post-approval requirements that require significant additional expenditures. For example, in February 2020, the FDA requested Eisai withdraw lorcaserin (commercialized as BELVIQ and BELVIQ XR) from the U.S. market. Furthermore, the discovery of significant problems with a product or class of products similar to any approved drug could have an adverse effect on our or our collaborator\u2019s or licensee\u2019s commercialization.\nIf we license or otherwise partner our drugs, our failure to maintain such agreements or poor performance or results under such agreements could negatively impact our business.\nOur collaborators and licensees may have primary responsibility for the regulatory approval, marketing and distribution, and, in certain circumstances, development, of our drug candidate(s) in the territory or territories under the applicable collaboration. We may have limited or no control over our collaborator\u2019s decisions, including the amount and timing of resources that any of these collaborators will dedicate to such activities. This is the case for our ralinepag exclusive license agreement with United Therapeutics and our lorcaserin Transaction Agreement with Eisai.\nWhen we enter collaboration and license agreements, we are subject to a number of other risks, including:\n\u2022\nour collaborators and licensees may not comply with applicable laws or regulatory guidelines, which could adversely impact the development or commercialization of the drug candidate;\n\u2022\nthere could be disagreements regarding the agreements or the study or development that delay or terminate the commercialization, research, study or development, delay or eliminate potential payments under the agreements or increase our costs under or outside of the agreements;\n\u2022\nour collaborators and licensees may not effectively allocate adequate resources, may have limited experience in a particular territory, or may generate unfavorable data or results; and\n\u2022\nour collaborators and licensees may not perform as expected, including with regard to making any required payments, and the agreements may not provide adequate protection or may not be effectively enforced.\nWe or our collaborators or licensees might terminate our agreements in certain circumstances or amend the terms of our agreement, and investors and analysts may not view any termination or amendment as favorable.\nWe rely on other companies, including third-party manufacturers and sole-source suppliers, to manufacture all our drugs and drug candidates, and we or such other companies may encounter failures or difficulties or not receive or provide adequate supply, which could adversely affect development or commercialization.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities that can produce active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, intermediates and other material required to make our drug candidates or lorcaserin. Instead, we rely on other companies to supply API, intermediates and other materials. Certain of these materials are available from only one or a small number of suppliers, and using a new supplier, if available, could result in substantial delay and greater cost. Our and our manufacturers\u2019 dependence on single or limited sources of materials may adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver drug products on a timely and competitive basis, or at all.\nAny performance failure on the part of us or a third-party manufacturer could result in a product recall or seizure, delay or otherwise adversely affect sales of an approved product or the clinical development or regulatory approval of one or more of our other drug candidates. We or third-party manufacturers may encounter difficulties involving production yields, regulatory compliance, lot release, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel.\nThe ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply drug product is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of the manufacturing facilities, which is impacted by many manufacturing variables, including:\n\u2022\navailability or contamination of raw materials and components used in the manufacturing process, particularly those for which we have no other source or supplier;\n\u2022\nability to accommodate changes in dosage or formulation;\n\u2022\ncapacity of our facilities or those of our contract manufacturers;\n\u2022\nhaving the ability to adjust to changes in actual or anticipated use of the facility, including with respect to having sufficient capacity and a sufficient number of qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nfacility contamination by microorganisms or viruses or cross contamination;\n\u2022\ncompliance with regulatory requirements, including inspectional notices of violation and warning letters;\n\u2022\nmaintenance and renewal of any required licenses or certifications;\n\u2022\nchanges in actual or forecasted demand;\n\u2022\ntiming and number of production runs;\n\u2022\nproduction success rates and bulk drug yields; and\n\u2022\ntiming and outcome of product quality testing.\nIn addition, we or our third-party manufacturers may encounter delays and problems in manufacturing our drug candidates or drugs for a variety of reasons, including accidents during operation, failure of equipment, delays in receiving materials, natural or other disasters, political or governmental unrest or changes, social unrest, intentional misconduct or other factors inherent in operating complex manufacturing facilities. Commercially available starting materials, reagents and excipients may be or become scarce or more expensive to procure, and we may not be able to obtain favorable terms in agreements with subcontractors. We or our third-party manufacturers may not be able to operate our respective manufacturing facilities in a cost-effective manner or in a time frame that is consistent with our expected future manufacturing needs. If we or our third-party manufacturers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party manufacturers and other service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us for any reason, such interruption could delay progress on our programs, or interrupt the commercial supply, with the potential for additional costs and lost revenues. If this were to occur, we may also need to seek alternative means to fulfill our manufacturing needs.\nWe may not be able to enter into or maintain agreements with manufacturers whose facilities and procedures comply with applicable law. Manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic inspection (which may be unannounced) by the FDA, the DEA, corresponding state and foreign authorities and other regulatory authorities to ensure strict compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, regulations and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over a third-party manufacturer\u2019s compliance with these regulations and standards. If we or one of our manufacturers or other company in the supply chain fail to maintain compliance or otherwise experience setbacks, we or they could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, the production of one or more of our drug candidates or any approved products could be interrupted or suspended, or our product could be recalled or withdrawn, resulting in delays, additional costs and potentially lost revenues.\nOur drug candidates are subject to extensive regulation, and we may not receive required regulatory approvals, or timely approvals, for any of our drug candidates.\nPreclinical and clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution, and other activities relating to developing and manufacturing drugs are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies. We and others we contract with are subject to periodic inspections (which may be unannounced) by the FDA, the DEA and other regulatory agencies. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may, either before or after product approval, subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions that may negatively impact research and development or commercialization, or otherwise negatively impact our business. Regulatory agencies have in the past inspected certain aspects of our business, and we were provided with observations of objectionable conditions or practices with respect to our business. There is no assurance that regulatory agencies will not provide us with observations in future inspections or that we satisfactorily addressed observations provided to us in past inspections.\nRegulatory approval of a drug candidate is not guaranteed, and our business and reputation may be harmed by any failure or significant delay in receiving regulatory approval. The number and types of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for FDA approval varies depending on the drug candidate, the disease or condition that the drug candidate is designed to target and the regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate. Despite the time and expense exerted in preclinical and clinical studies, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon clinical trials or to repeat or perform additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.\nWe cannot predict when or whether, or assure you that, our collaborators\u2019 or our past or any future regulatory submissions or responses will be sufficient to the applicable regulatory authority or others, that the applicable regulatory authority or others will consider data or our analyses, interpretations or procedures related to any of our drug candidates as sufficient or persuasive, or that any regulatory authority will ever approve any of our drug candidates in the future.\nTo market any drugs outside of the United States, we and our current or future collaborators must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks associated with FDA approval as well as additional risks, some of which may be unanticipated. Approval by the FDA or any other regulatory authority does not assure or predict with any certainty that any other regulatory authority will approve the drug.\nIn addition, existing regulatory policies and laws may change. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of new government regulation, either in the United States or in other countries, or the impact on our drug candidates or drugs. For example, new FDA regulation could delay or prevent marketing approvals, increase the cost of research and development, and result in narrower product labeling and expensive post-marketing requirements.\nFast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval, Priority Review, or similar designations by the FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies may not lead to a faster development or review process.\nThe FDA may grant Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval, Priority Review, or other designation to product candidates that meet applicable guidelines in order to speed the availability of certain drugs. Other applicable regulatory agencies may grant similar designations. These designations may apply only to the combination of a product candidate and a specific indication or patient population. Product candidates that receive these designations may not actually receive faster clinical development or regulatory review or approval any sooner than other product candidates that do not have such designation, or at all. Furthermore, a product\u2019s receipt of such a designation does not increase the likelihood that the product candidate will receive marketing approval. The FDA or other regulatory agency may also withdraw a designation if it determines that the product candidate no longer meets the relevant criteria.\nFor example, the FDA has granted Fast Track designation for APD418 for treatment of decompensated heart failure, or DHF, in patients who have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or HFrEF. Despite receiving Fast Track designation, such designation may be withdrawn in the future, and in any event APD418 may not actually receive faster clinical development or regulatory review or approval any sooner than other product candidates that do not have such designation, or at all.\nOur activities and drugs will still be subject to extensive postmarketing regulation if approved.\nFollowing regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates, we and our collaborators will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review from the FDA and other applicable regulatory agencies, such as continued adverse event reporting requirements. There may also be additional postmarketing obligations imposed by the FDA or other regulatory agencies. These obligations may result in significant expense and limit the ability to commercialize such drugs.\nThe FDA or other regulatory agencies may also require that the sponsor of the NDA or foreign equivalent, as applicable, conduct additional clinical trials to further assess approved drugs after approval under a post-approval commitment. Such additional studies may be costly and may impact the commercialization of the drug. Unfavorable trial results from postmarketing studies could negatively impact market acceptance of the drug, limit the revenues we generate from sales, result in the drug\u2019s withdrawal from the market, negatively impact the potential approval of the drug in other territories and result in litigation.\nThe FDA or other regulatory agencies may also impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses for which a drug may be marketed. Additionally, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, study, including in connection with a drug\u2019s approval, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. A REMS may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate healthcare providers of the drug\u2019s risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry or undergo certain health evaluations or other measures that the FDA deems necessary to ensure the safe use of the drug.\nWith regard to any of drug that receives regulatory approval, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising and promotion for the drug will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. We and the manufacturers of our products are also required to comply with cGMP regulations, which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Further, regulatory agencies must approve these manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture our products, and these facilities are subject to ongoing regulatory inspections. In addition, regulatory agencies subject a drug, its manufacturer and the manufacturer\u2019s facilities to continual review and inspections. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the drug is manufactured, may result in restrictions on the marketing of that drug, up to and including withdrawal of the drug from the market. In the United States, the DEA and comparable state-level agencies also heavily regulate the manufacturing, holding, processing, security, recordkeeping and distribution of drugs that are considered controlled substances, and the DEA periodically inspects facilities for compliance with its rules and regulations.\nOur ability to generate revenues from any of our drugs that receive regulatory approval will be subject to a variety of risks, many of which are out of our control.\nAny drug that may be approved for marketing may not gain market acceptance among patients, healthcare providers, healthcare payers or the medical community. We believe that the degree of market acceptance and our ability to generate revenues from such products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ntiming of market introduction of our drugs and competitive drugs and alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nphysician and patient awareness of our drugs;\n\u2022\nactual and perceived efficacy and safety of our drugs;\n\u2022\nincidence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022\npotential or perceived advantages or disadvantages as compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\neffectiveness of sales, marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nprice of our future products, both in absolute terms and relative to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe general marketplace for the particular drug;\n\u2022\nthe effect of current and future healthcare laws on our drug candidates;\n\u2022\navailability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from government and other third-party payers; and\n\u2022\nproduct labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities.\nIf our approved drugs fail to achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate significant revenues to be profitable.\nCollaboration and license agreement relationships may lead to disputes, divert management\u2019s attention, expose us to liability and delay drug development and commercialization, and we may not realize the full commercial potential of our drug candidates or drugs.\nWe may have conflicts with our prospective, current or past collaborators or licensees, such as conflicts concerning rights and obligations under our agreements (including, for example, relating to indemnification for product liability claims and losses), the interpretation of preclinical or clinical data, the achievement of milestone or other payments, the ownership of intellectual property, or research and development, regulatory, commercialization, litigation or other strategy. Collaborators or licensees may stop supporting\nour drug candidates or drugs, including if they no longer view the program as in their best financial or other interests or they develop or obtain rights to competing drug candidates or drugs. In addition, collaborators or licensees may fail to effectively develop, obtain approval for or commercialize our drugs, which may result in us not realizing their full commercial potential. If any conflicts arise with any of our current, past or prospective collaborators or licensees, the other party may act in a manner that is adverse to our interests. Any such disagreement could result in one or more of the following, each of which could delay, or lead to termination of, development or commercialization of our drug candidates or drugs, and in turn prevent us from generating revenues or cause us to incur liabilities:\n\u2022\nunwillingness or inability on the part of a collaborator or licensee to pay for studies or other research, milestones, royalties or other payments that we believe are due to us under a collaboration;\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding ownership of intellectual property rights arising from our collaboration or license agreement activities, which could prevent us from entering into additional collaborations;\n\u2022\nunwillingness on the part of a collaborator or licensee to keep us informed regarding the progress of its development, regulatory, commercialization, pharmacovigilance or other activities or to permit public disclosure of the results of those activities;\n\u2022\nslowing or cessation of a collaborator\u2019s or licensee\u2019s research, development, regulatory or commercialization efforts with respect to our drug candidates or drugs; or\n\u2022\nlitigation or arbitration with our collaborator or licensee, or with third parties (including relating to product liability, intellectual property or other subject matters).\nSetbacks and consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could make entering into agreements with pharmaceutical companies to collaborate or commercialize our drugs more difficult and diminish our revenues.\nSetbacks in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, such as those caused by safety concerns relating to drugs or drug candidates, as well as competition from generic drugs, litigation and industry consolidation, may have an adverse effect on us, including by making it more difficult to enter into agreements with pharmaceutical companies to collaborate or commercialize our drugs and diminishing our revenues. For example, the FDA may be more cautious in approving our drug candidates based on safety concerns relating to these or other drugs or drug candidates, or pharmaceutical companies may be less willing to enter into new collaborations or continue existing collaborations if they are integrating a new operation as a result of a merger or acquisition or if their therapeutic areas of focus change following a merger.\nWe and our collaborators rely on third parties to conduct clinical trials and preclinical studies. If those parties do not comply with regulatory and contractual requirements, successfully carry out their contractual obligations or meet expected deadlines, our drug candidates may not advance in a timely manner or at all.\nIn the course of our discovery, preclinical testing and clinical trials, we and our collaborators rely on third parties, including investigators, clinical research organizations, manufacturers and laboratories, to perform critical services. For example, we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and many of our preclinical studies. Clinical research organizations are responsible for many aspects of the trials, including finding and enrolling subjects for testing and administering the trials. Although we rely on these third parties to conduct our clinical trials, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. These third parties may not be available when we need them or, if they are available, may not comply with all legal, regulatory and contractual requirements or may not otherwise perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner, and we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties and our preclinical studies or clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. These independent third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of which may compete with us. In addition, if such third parties fail to perform their obligations in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and our protocols, our preclinical studies or clinical trials may not meet regulatory requirements or may need to be repeated. As a result of our dependence on third parties, we may face delays or failures outside of our direct control. These risks also apply to the development activities of collaborators, and we do not control their research and development, clinical trial or regulatory activities.\nWe may participate in new strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity, increase our expenses, present significant distractions to our management and be viewed as unfavorable.\nFrom time to time we consider strategic transactions, such as out-licensing or in-licensing of compounds or technologies, acquisitions of companies, asset purchases and spin-offs. Additional potential transactions we may consider include a variety of different business arrangements, such as strategic collaborations, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business combinations and investments. In addition, another entity may pursue us as an acquisition target. Any such transaction may be viewed as unfavorable by our stockholders or others and may require us to incur non-recurring or other charges, may create potential liabilities, may increase our near- and long-term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges, require additional expertise or disrupt our management or business, which could harm our operations and financial results.\nWhen we evaluate significant proposed transactions we conduct business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in the transaction. Despite our efforts, we ultimately may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks and, as a result, might not realize the intended advantages of the transaction. If we fail to realize the expected benefits from any transaction we may consummate, whether as a result of unidentified risks, integration difficulties, regulatory setbacks or other events, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may incur substantial liabilities for any product liability claims or otherwise as a drug product developer.\nWe develop, test, manufacture and expect to commercialize drugs for use by humans. We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our drug candidates in clinical trials, and a risk with the commercialization of lorcaserin (marketed as BELVIQ and BELVIQ XR) as well as any other drug that may be approved for marketing.\nWhether or not we are ultimately successful in any product liability or related litigation, such litigation would consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, and might result in adverse publicity, all of which would impair our business. In addition, damages awarded in a product liability action could be substantial and could have a negative impact on our financial condition.\nAn individual may bring a liability claim against us if one of our drugs or drug candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our drug;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nincreased difficulty to attract, or withdrawal of, clinical trial subjects;\n\u2022\ncosts of related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to subjects or other claimants;\n\u2022\nloss of revenues; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our drug candidates.\nWe have limited product liability insurance that covers our clinical trials and products, as well as indemnification protection in certain of our collaboration or license agreements. We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, we may not have insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise, and our collaborators or licensees may not indemnify us, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur subsidiary Arena Pharmaceuticals GmbH in Liquidation (\u201cArena GmbH\u201d) manufactured BELVIQ and other products for commercialization or clinical trials, up until the sale of our manufacturing business to Siegfried effective March 31, 2018. We could be subject to liability for manufacturing defect claims relating to our manufacturing activities that preceded the closing of the sale. For example, under our agreement with Eisai, we and Eisai will each bear 50% of losses arising from any alleged defective manufacturing of BELVIQ by Arena GmbH prior to the date of the sale to Siegfried.\nWe have significant contractual obligations that may adversely affect our cash flow, cash position and stock price.\nWe have long-term leases on real properties and other contractual obligations, and limited revenues. If we are unable to generate cash from operations in the future sufficient to meet our financial obligations we will need to obtain additional funds from other sources, and we may not be able to do so at all or on terms favorable to our stockholders or us.\nAlso, if we do not have sufficient cash in the future and are unable to generate cash from operations or obtain additional funds from other sources sufficient to meet our contractual obligations, we may have to delay or curtail some or all of our development and commercialization programs, sell or license some or all of our assets on terms that you or others may view as unfavorable, or default on obligations under our agreements.\nWe may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare laws, including but not limited to fraud and abuse and false claims laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties and prosecution.\nIn the United States, drug manufacturers and marketers are subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and Federal False Claims Act. There are similar laws in other countries. These laws may impact, among other things, the research, manufacturing, sales, marketing and education programs for our drugs.\nThe Federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons and entities from knowingly and willingly soliciting, offering, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order or the furnishing or arranging for, a good, item, facility or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Several courts have interpreted the statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and, despite a series of narrow statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Moreover, the ACA, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them. The ACA also provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the Federal Civil False Claims Act. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nThe Federal Civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. Suits filed under the Federal Civil False Claims Act can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, and such individuals, commonly known as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The filing of qui tam actions has caused a number of pharmaceutical, medical device and other healthcare companies to have to defend a Federal Civil False Claims Act action. When an entity is determined to have violated the Federal Civil False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim, in addition to other penalties that may apply. Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the Federal Civil False Claims Act, some of which are broader in scope and may apply regardless of payer.\nThe Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Additionally, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.\nThe Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the ACA, and its implementing regulations requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.\nWe may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Further, we may also be subject to state health information privacy and data breach notification laws which govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus requiring additional compliance efforts.\nAdditionally, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers\u2019 products are appropriately licensed. Further, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.\nWe are unable to predict whether we could be subject to actions under any of these fraud and abuse or other laws, or the impact of such actions. If we are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above and other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, including civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, disgorgement, possible exclusion from government healthcare reimbursement programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to effectively integrate, manage or maintain our international operations, and such difficulty could adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nWe have certain clinical operations personnel in Switzerland, and we engage in clinical trials and manufacturing activities in many territories outside of the United States. There are significant risks associated with foreign operations, including, but not limited to, compliance with local laws and regulations, the protection of our intellectual property, the ability to integrate our corporate culture with local customs and cultures, the distraction to our management, foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of shifts in the United States and local economies on those rates, and integration of our policies and procedures, including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, with our international operations.\nWith respect to local laws and regulations, the European Union, Switzerland and certain other foreign territories have restrictions on the transfer, use and maintenance of certain personal data, including providing that transfers of personal data outside of their territories may only take place if the country to which the personal data is transferred ensures an \u201cadequate\u201d level of privacy protection. The European Commission has previously found that the United States did not provide adequate levels of protection. In addition, the European Commission has approved a data protection regulation, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR contains provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information, higher sanctions and extra-territoriality measures intended to bring non-EU companies under the regulation. We conduct clinical trials in the EU, and in the future we may expand our business operations to include additional operations in the EU. With such expansion, we would be subject to increased governmental regulation, including the GDPR, in the EU countries in which we operate, including restrictions on data transfers that may negatively impact our ability and increase our costs to maintain international operations. Penalties for non-compliance with the GDPR are steep, with potential fines of up to 4% of our global revenue.\nAdditionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates new individual privacy rights for consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. It requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches. The CCPA may impact our business activities and exemplifies the vulnerability of our business to not only cyber threats but also the evolving regulatory environment related to personal data and protected health information.\nAcross the United States and globally, laws and regulations governing data privacy and security continue to develop and evolve. The data privacy and security laws and regulations to which we are subject will likely impact (possibly significantly) our business activities. Many of the laws and regulations that apply to us contain ambiguous provisions or impose requirements that differ from country to country, creating uncertainty. Compliance with the enhanced obligations imposed by such laws and regulations may require us to revise our business practices, allocate more resources to privacy and security, and implement new technologies. Such efforts may result in significant costs to our business.\nFailure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nWe and third parties we contract with use hazardous materials in our operations.\nOur activities involve the use of materials that could be hazardous to human health and safety or the environment. We cannot completely eliminate the risks associated with their use, storage or disposal, which could cause:\n\u2022\ninterruption of our development or manufacturing efforts;\n\u2022\ninjury to our employees and others;\n\u2022\nenvironmental damage resulting in costly clean up; and\n\u2022\nliabilities under domestic or foreign laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products.\nIn such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages, and any such liability could exceed our resources. Although we carry insurance in amounts and type that we consider commercially reasonable, we cannot be certain that the coverage or coverage limits of our insurance policies will be adequate, and we do not have insurance coverage for losses relating to an interruption of our research and development efforts caused by contamination.\nOur business and operations might be disrupted or adversely affected by catastrophic events and security breaches, including any cybersecurity incidents.\nOur U.S. operations are primarily located in a business park in San Diego. We also have certain operations in Boston, Massachusetts, and Zug, Switzerland. We depend on our facilities and on collaborators, licensees, contractors and vendors for the continued operation of our business, some of whom are located in Europe and Asia. As a result, natural disasters or other catastrophic events in various parts of the world, including interruptions in the supply of natural resources, political and governmental changes, disruption in transportation networks or delivery services, severe weather conditions, wildfires and other fires, explosions, actions of animal rights activists, terrorist attacks, earthquakes, wars and public health issues (including, for example, the outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019) could disrupt our operations or those of our collaborators, contractors and vendors or contribute to unfavorable economic or other conditions that could adversely impact us.\nWe depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems, which we use for, among other things, sensitive company data, including our financial data, intellectual property and other proprietary business information.\nWhile certain of our operations have business continuity and disaster recovery plans and other security measures intended to prevent and minimize the impact of IT-related interruptions, our IT infrastructure and the IT infrastructure of our current and any future collaborators, contractors and vendors are vulnerable to damage from cyberattacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, electrical failures and natural disasters or other catastrophic events. We could experience failures in our information systems and computer servers, which could result in an interruption of our normal business operations and require substantial expenditure of financial and administrative resources to remedy. System failures, accidents or security breaches can cause interruptions in our operations and can result in a material disruption of our research and development programs and other business operations. The loss of data from completed or future studies or clinical trials could result in delays in our research, development or regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Similarly, we and our licensees rely on third parties to conduct studies and clinical trials of our drug candidates, manufacture our drug candidates and lorcaserin, and warehouse, market and distribute lorcaserin, and similar events relating to these third parties\u2019 computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liabilities and the development of any of our other drug candidates and the commercialization of drugs could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nEven though we believe we carry commercially reasonable business interruption and liability insurance, and our contractors may carry liability insurance that protect us in certain events, we might suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our and our contractors\u2019 insurance policies or for which we or our contractors do not have coverage. For example, we are not insured against a terrorist attack. Any natural disaster or catastrophic event could have a significant negative impact on our operations and financial results. Moreover, any such event could delay our research and development programs and adversely affect, which may include stopping, our commercial production.\nWe and our employees and directors may be named as defendants in litigation that could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention.\nSecurities class action litigation may be brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because companies in the pharmaceuticals industry often experience significant stock price volatility. For example, beginning in 2010, a number of lawsuits were filed against us and certain of our employees and directors alleging we\nand the other defendants violated the federal securities laws by making materially false and misleading statements regarding our lorcaserin trials, thereby artificially inflating the price of our common stock. These lawsuits were settled in 2018.\nWhile we carry liability insurance, any losses we incur in connection with any future lawsuits may not be covered by insurance in an amount sufficient to cover our losses or at all, and our assets may be insufficient to cover any amounts that exceed our insurance coverage. We may have to pay damage awards or otherwise may enter into settlement arrangements in connection with any future claims. A settlement of any of future lawsuit against us could also involve the issuance of common stock or other equity, which may dilute your ownership interest. Any payments or settlement arrangements could have material adverse effects on our business, operating results, financial condition or your ownership interest. Even if the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not successful, any future lawsuit against us and/or our directors or executive officers could result in substantial costs and significantly and adversely impact our reputation and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, any such lawsuits may make it more difficult to finance our operations, obtain certain types of insurance (including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance), and attract and retain qualified executive officers, other employees and directors.\nNegative U.S. and global economic conditions may pose challenges to our business strategy, which relies on funding from collaborators or the financial markets, and may create other financial risks for us.\nNegative conditions in the U.S. or global economy, including financial markets, may adversely affect our business and the business of our current and prospective collaborators, distributors and licensees, which we sometimes refer to generally as our collaborators, and others with which we do or may conduct business. The duration and severity of these conditions is uncertain. If negative economic conditions persist or worsen, we may be unable to secure funding to sustain our operations or to find suitable collaborators to advance our internal programs, even if we achieve positive results from our research and development or business development efforts. Such negative conditions could also impact commercialization of any drugs we and our collaborators and licensees develop, as well as our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may maintain a portfolio of investments in marketable debt securities, which are recorded at fair value. Although we have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturity with the objectives of maintaining safety of principal and liquidity, we rely on credit rating agencies to help evaluate the riskiness of investments, and such agencies may not accurately predict such risk. In addition, such agencies may reduce the credit quality of our individual holdings, which could adversely affect their value. Lower credit quality and other market events, such as changes in interest rates and deterioration in credit markets, may have an adverse effect on the fair value of our investment holdings and cash position.\nCurrency fluctuations may negatively affect our financial condition.\nWe primarily spend and generate cash in U.S. dollars and present our consolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars. However, a portion of our expected and potential payments and receipts, including relating to our Swiss operations and under certain of our agreements, are in foreign currencies. A fluctuation of the exchange rates of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar may, thus, adversely affect our financial results, including cash balances, expenses and revenues. We may in the future enter into hedging transactions to try to reduce our foreign currency exposure, but there is no assurance that such transactions will occur or be successful.\nLaws, rules and regulations, including relating to public companies, may be costly and impact our ability to attract and retain directors and executive officers.\nLaws and regulations affecting public companies, including rules adopted by the SEC and by Nasdaq, judicial rulings and other laws and regulations, including, for example, of state, federal and foreign governments and relating to privacy, may result in increased costs to us, particularly as we continue to develop the required capabilities in the United States and abroad to develop and commercialize our products. These laws, rules and regulations could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws, rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on our board committees or as executive officers. We cannot estimate accurately the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these laws, rules and regulations.\nChanges in funding for the FDA, the SEC and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the SEC and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.\nThe withdrawal of the United Kingdom, from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d may adversely impact our ability to obtain regulatory approvals of our product candidates in the European Union, result in restrictions or imposition of taxes and duties for importing our product candidates into the European Union, and may require us to incur additional expenses in order to develop, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates in the European Union.\nFollowing the result of a referendum in 2016, the United Kingdom left the European Union on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the United Kingdom and the European Union, the United Kingdom will be subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020, or the Transition Period, during which EU rules will continue to apply. Negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union are expected to continue in relation to the customs and trading relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union following the expiry of the Transition Period.\nSince a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom applicable to our business and our product candidates is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit, following the Transition Period, could materially impact the regulatory regime with respect to the development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our product candidates in the United Kingdom or the European Union. For example, as a result of the uncertainty surrounding Brexit, the EMA relocated to Amsterdam from London. Following the Transition Period, the United Kingdom will no longer be covered by the centralized procedures for obtaining EU-wide marketing authorization from the EMA and, unless a specific agreement is entered into, a separate process for authorization of drug products, including our product candidates, will be required in the United Kingdom, the potential process for which is currently unclear. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates in the United Kingdom or the European Union and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability. In addition, we may be required to pay taxes or duties or be subjected to other hurdles in connection with the importation of our product candidates into the European Union, or we may incur expenses in establishing a manufacturing facility in the European Union in order to circumvent such hurdles. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United Kingdom or the European Union for our product candidates, or incur significant additional expenses to operate our business, which could significantly and materially harm or delay our ability to generate revenues or achieve profitability of our business. Any further changes in international trade, tariff and import/export regulations as a result of Brexit or otherwise may impose unexpected duty costs or other non-tariff barriers on us. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between the impacted nations and the United Kingdom.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent potential errors and fraud\nOur management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all potential errors and fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. There are inherent limitations in all control systems, and no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, or misstatements due to error, if any, within the company have been detected. While we believe that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are and have been effective at the reasonable assurance level, we intend to continue to examine and refine our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting and to monitor ongoing developments in these areas.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $933.2 million. Our federal net operating loss carryforwards of $539.3 million will begin to expire, if not utilized, beginning in 2029, and our state net operating loss carryforwards of $393.9 million begin expiring in 2028. Our net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. In January 2019, a taxable income-generating event, the transaction pursuant to the United Therapeutics Agreement, resulted in it being more likely than not that a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards would be used to offset our estimates of taxable income in 2019. If the estimates we have made, or the assumptions on which we relied, in estimating our taxable income in 2019 prove inaccurate, our net operating loss carryforwards to be used to offset our taxable income in 2019 may vary from our estimates. Under the TCJA, federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the TCJA. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We have experienced ownership changes in the past and we may experience additional ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nCurrent and future tax laws and regulation could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe TCJA significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The TCJA among other things, contained significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits (including reducing the business tax credit for certain clinical testing expenses incurred in the testing of certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions). Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the TCJA is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to this federal tax law.\nChanges or modifications in financial accounting standards, including those related to revenue recognition, may harm our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, either alone or jointly with other organizations, promulgates new accounting principles that could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or reported cash flows. Any difficulties in adopting or implementing any new accounting standard, or updating or modifying our internal controls as needed on a timely basis, could result in our failure to meet our financial reporting obligations, which could result in regulatory discipline and harm investors\u2019 confidence in us. In addition, if we were to change our critical accounting estimates, including those related to the recognition of revenue, our operating results could be significantly affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nOur success is dependent on intellectual property rights held by us and third parties and our interest in these rights is complex and uncertain.\nOur success will depend on our own and on current or future collaborators\u2019 abilities to obtain, maintain and defend patents. In particular, the patents directed to our drug candidates and drugs are important to developing and commercializing drugs and to our revenue. We have numerous U.S. and foreign patents issued and patent applications pending for our technologies. There is no assurance that any of our patent applications will issue, or that any of the patents will be enforceable or will cover a drug or other commercially significant technology or method, or that the patents will be held to be valid for their expected terms.\nThe procedures for obtaining a patent are complex. These procedures require an analysis of the scientific technology related to the invention and many sophisticated legal issues. Obtaining patent rights outside the United States often requires the translation of highly technical documents and an improper translation may jeopardize our patent protection. Ensuring adequate quality of translators and foreign patent attorneys is often very challenging. Consequently, the process for having our pending patent applications issue as patents will be difficult, complex, time consuming and expensive. Our patent position is very uncertain and we do not know when, or if, we will obtain additional patents, or if the scope of the patents obtained will be sufficient to protect our drugs, or be considered sufficient by parties reviewing our patent positions pursuant to a potential marketing, licensing or financing transaction.\nIn addition, other entities may challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents in litigation or administrative proceedings. We cannot make assurances as to how much protection, if any, our patents will provide if we attempt to enforce them or they are challenged. It is possible that a competitor or a generic pharmaceutical provider may successfully challenge our patents and those challenges may result in reduction or elimination of our patent coverage.\nWe also rely on confidentiality agreements and trade secrets to protect our technologies. However, such information is difficult to protect. We require our employees to contractually agree not to improperly use our confidential information or disclose it to others, but we may be unable to determine if our employees have conformed or will conform to their legal obligations under these agreements. We also enter into confidentiality agreements with prospective collaborators, collaborators, service providers and consultants, but we may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of this information. Many of our employees and consultants were, and many of them may currently be, parties to confidentiality agreements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and the use of our technologies could violate these agreements. In addition, third parties may independently discover our trade secrets or other proprietary information.\nSome of our research and development collaborators and scientific consultants have rights to publish data and information to which we have rights. We generally seek to prevent our collaborators and consultants from disclosing scientific discoveries before we have the opportunity to file patent applications on such discoveries. In some of our collaborations, we do not control our collaborators\u2019 ability to disclose their own discoveries under the collaboration and in some of our academic relationships we are limited to relatively short periods to review a proposed publication and file a patent application. If we cannot maintain confidentiality in connection with our collaborations and relationships, our ability to receive patent protection or protect our proprietary information will be impaired.\nWe believe that the United States is by far the largest single market for pharmaceuticals in the world. Because of the critical nature of patent rights to our industry, changes in U.S. patent laws could have a profound effect on our future profits, if any. It is unknown which, if any, patent laws will change, how changes to the patent laws will ultimately be enforced by the courts and how it would impact our business.\nA dispute regarding the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others could be costly and result in delays or termination of our future research, development, manufacturing and sales activities.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability to develop and manufacture our drugs and drug candidates, market and sell drugs, and conduct our research and development activities without infringing or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others. There are many issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others relating to research and development programs that could be determined to be similar, identical or superior to ours or our licensors or collaborators. We may be exposed to future litigation by others based on claims that our drugs, drug candidates, technologies or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Numerous issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others exist in the areas of our research and development, including some which purport to allow the patent holder to control the use of all drugs that modulate a particular drug target regardless of whether the infringing drug bears any structural resemblance to a chemical compound known to the patent holder at the time of patent filing. Numerous issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others also exist in the therapeutic areas in which we are developing drugs. There are also numerous issued patents and pending patent applications owned by others that are directed to chemical compounds or synthetic processes that may be necessary or useful to our research, development, manufacturing or commercialization activities. These could materially affect our ability to develop our drug candidates or manufacture, import or sell drugs, and our activities, or those of our licensors or collaborators, could be determined to infringe these patents. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that our drugs, drug candidates or technologies may infringe. There also may be existing patents owned by others, of which we are not aware, that our drug candidates or technologies may infringe. Further, there may be issued patents or pending patent applications owned by others in fields relevant to our business, of which we are or may become aware, that we believe (i) are invalid, unenforceable, or we do not infringe; (ii) relate to immaterial portions of our overall research and development, manufacturing and commercialization efforts; or (iii) in the case of pending patent applications, the resulting patent would not be granted or, if granted, would not likely be enforced in a manner that would materially impact such efforts. We cannot assure you that others holding any of these patents or patent applications will not assert infringement claims against us and seek damages or enjoinment of our activities. We also cannot assure you that, in the event of litigation, we will be able to successfully assert non-infringement, unenforceability, invalidity or immateriality, or that any infringement claims will be resolved in our favor.\nIn addition, others may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights. We may have to institute costly legal action to protect our intellectual property rights, or we may not be able to afford the costs of enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights.\nThere could be significant litigation and other administrative proceedings in our industry that affect us regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Any legal action or administrative action against us, or our collaborators, claiming damages or seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our research and development, manufacturing and commercialization activities could:\n\u2022\nrequire us, or our collaborators, to obtain a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nprevent us from importing, making, using, selling or offering to sell the subject matter claimed in patents held by others and subject us to potential liability for damages;\n\u2022\nconsume a substantial portion of our managerial, scientific and financial resources; or\n\u2022\nbe costly, regardless of the outcome.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of pre-trial document and witness discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised. In addition, during the course of intellectual property litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are aware of third-party patents, as well as third-party patent applications, that could adversely affect the potential commercialization of etrasimod. For example, we are aware of third-party patents, as well as a third-party patent application, with broad claims to administering an S1P modulator by starting with a lower dose and then increasing to a higher, standard daily dose. While we do not believe that any such claims that would cover the potential commercialization of etrasimod are valid and enforceable, we may be incorrect in this belief.\nWe have been contacted from time to time by third parties regarding their intellectual property rights, sometimes asserting that we may need a license to use their technologies. If we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes to our technologies, we may become involved in expensive and time-consuming litigation or we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our drugs or drug candidates.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of any litigation matter. For example, our existing patents could be invalidated, found unenforceable or found not to cover a generic form of our drugs.\nWe cannot protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patents on all of our drug candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. Many countries, including certain countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties (for example, the patent owner has failed to \u201cwork\u201d the invention in that country or the third party has patented improvements). In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. Compulsory licensing of life-saving drugs is also becoming increasingly popular in developing countries either through direct legislation or international initiatives. Such compulsory licenses could be extended to include some of our drug candidates, which could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Moreover, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals, which makes it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nOur stock price will likely be volatile, and your investment in our stock could decline in value.\nOur stock price has fluctuated historically. From January 1, 2018, to February 21, 2020, the market price of our stock was as low as $30.00 per share and as high as $64.48 per share.\nVery few drug candidates being tested will ultimately receive regulatory approval, and companies in our industry sometimes experience significant volatility in their stock price. Our stock price may fluctuate significantly depending on a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nresults or decisions affecting the development or commercialization of any of our drug candidates or drugs, including the results of studies, trials and other analyses;\n\u2022\nthe success, failure or setbacks of our or a perceived competitor\u2019s drugs or drug candidates;\n\u2022\nthe timing of the development of our drug candidates;\n\u2022\ndiscussions or recommendations affecting our drugs or drug candidates by the FDA or other reviewers of preclinical or clinical data or other information related to our drug candidates or drugs;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions or decisions or legislation affecting drugs or drug candidates, including ours and those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe commercial availability and success or failure of any of our drug candidates or lorcaserin;\n\u2022\nthe development and implementation of our continuing development and research plans, including outcome studies for lorcaserin;\n\u2022\nthe entrance into, or failure to enter into, a new collaboration or the modification or termination of an existing collaboration or other material transaction;\n\u2022\nthe timing and receipt by us of milestone and other payments or failing to achieve and receive the same;\n\u2022\nfluctuation in prescriptions, sales or financial results (including with respect to revenue recognition, expenses and other operating results) or inaccurate sales or cash forecasting;\n\u2022\naccounting restatements and changes;\n\u2022\nsupply chain or manufacturing issues;\n\u2022\nchanges in our research and development budget or the research and development budgets of our existing or potential collaborators;\n\u2022\nthe introduction, development or withdrawal of drug candidates or drugs by others that target the same diseases and conditions that we or our collaborators target or the introduction of new drug discovery techniques;\n\u2022\nexpenses related to, and the results of, litigation, other disputes and other proceedings;\n\u2022\nfinancing strategy or decisions;\n\u2022\nthe allocation of our resources;\n\u2022\nour ability, or the perception by investors of our ability, to continue to meet all applicable requirements for continued listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market, and the possible delisting of our common stock if we are unable to do so;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in intellectual property rights or related announcements; and\n\u2022\ncapital market and other macroeconomic conditions.\nWe are not able to control many of these factors. If our financial or scientific results in a particular period do not meet stockholders\u2019 or analysts\u2019 expectations, our stock price may decline, and such decline could be significant.\nAny future equity or debt issuances or other financing transactions may have dilutive or adverse effects on our existing stockholders.\nWe have been opportunistic in our efforts to obtain cash, and we expect we will evaluate various funding alternatives from time to time. We may issue additional shares of common stock or convertible securities that could dilute your ownership in our company and may include terms that give new investors rights that are superior to yours. We have effective registration statements to sell shares of our common stock and certain other securities, and we may elect to sell shares pursuant to such registration from time to time.\nMoreover, any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our common stock and in any event may have a dilutive impact on your ownership interest, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, we may also raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt or other financing transaction, and the investors may have rights superior to your rights in the event we are not successful and are forced to seek the protection of bankruptcy laws or the transaction may otherwise adversely affect our business prospects and existing stockholders.\nOur executive officers and directors may sell shares of their stock, and these sales could adversely affect our stock price.\nSales of our stock by our executive officers and directors, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our stock. Our executive officers and directors may sell stock in the future, either as part, or outside, of trading plans under Rule 10b5-1 of the SEC.\nThere are a substantial number of shares of our common stock that may become eligible for future sale in the public market, and the sale of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to fall.\nAs of February 21, 2020, there were (i) options to purchase 8,623,463 shares of our common stock outstanding under our equity incentive plans at a weighted-average exercise price of $34.76 per share, (ii) 23,564 restricted stock unit awards outstanding under our equity incentive plans, (iii) performance restricted stock units outstanding under our equity incentive plans under which up to 416,045 shares of common stock may be issuable upon achievement of all specified performance goals, (iv) 3,868,097 additional shares of common stock remaining issuable under our Amended and Restated 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan, and (v) 1,000,000 shares issuable under our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\nOnce issued, the shares described above will be available for immediate resale in the public market. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of such resales due to the increased number of shares available for sale in the market. As of February 21, 2020, there were 50,249,149 shares of our common stock outstanding.\nThe holders of our common stock and other securities may take actions that are contrary to your interests, including selling their stock.\nA small number of stockholders may hold or acquire a significant amount of our outstanding stock. From time to time, there is a large short interest in our stock. These holders of such stock or positions may seek control of us, may support transactions that we or you do not believe are favorable, and may have interests that are different from yours. In addition, sales of a large number of shares of our stock by these large stockholders or other stockholders within a short period of time could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe may also be involved in disagreements with the holders of our stock, warrants or other securities in the future. Such disagreements may lead to proxy contests or litigation, which may be expensive and consume management\u2019s time, involve settlements, the terms of which may not be favorable to us, or result in other negative consequences to our business.\nCertain of our agreements, provisions in our charter documents, possible future agreements and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in management or a takeover attempt that you may consider to be in your best interests.\nThere is a standstill provision in our transaction agreement with Eisai, and we may enter into agreements with similar provisions. In addition, we may in the future adopt a stockholders\u2019 rights agreement, which would cause substantial dilution to any person who attempts to acquire us in a manner or on terms not approved by our board of directors. These provisions or agreements, as well as other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law, could delay or prevent the removal of directors and management and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us that you may consider to be in your best interests. For example, our charter provisions:\n\u2022\nallow our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nlimit who can call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\neliminate stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters to be acted upon at stockholders\u2019 meetings.", "PERMNO": 88421, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ARNA"}
