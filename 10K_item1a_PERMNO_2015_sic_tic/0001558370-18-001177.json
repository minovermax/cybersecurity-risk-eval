{"cik": "1475841", "company": "National Bank Holdings Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Banking Operations\nWe are still a relatively young Company with a limited and complex operating history from which investors can evaluate our past financial and operating performance and future prospects.\nWe were organized in 2009 and acquired selected assets and assumed selected liabilities of Hillcrest Bank, Bank Midwest, Bank of Choice and Community Banks of Colorado in October 2010, December 2010, July 2011 and October 2011, respectively, and acquired Pine River Valley Bank and Peoples, Inc. by merger in August 2015 and January 2018, respectively. Because our banking operations began in late 2010, and because our acquisitions in 2010 and 2011 were of failed or troubled banks, we have a limited operating history upon which investors can evaluate our operational performance or compare our recent performance to historical performance. The business models and experiences of the depository institutions we have acquired to date and may acquire in the future may not be reflective of our plans. More importantly, because a portion of our acquired loans and other real estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d) were covered by loss sharing agreements with the FDIC and all of the loans and OREO we acquired were marked to fair value at the time of our acquisitions, we believe that the historical financial results of the acquisitions are less useful to an evaluation of our future prospects and financial and operating performance.\nCertain other factors may also make it difficult for investors to evaluate our future prospects and financial and operating performance, including, among others:\n\uf0b7\nour current asset mix, loan quality and allowance for loan losses are not fully representative of our anticipated future asset mix, loan quality and allowance for loan losses, which may change materially as we continue to undertake organic loan origination and banking activities and pursue future acquisitions;\n\uf0b7\nthe income we report from certain acquired assets due to loan discounts and accretable yield may be higher than the returns available in the current market and, if we are unable to make new performing loans and acquire other performing assets in sufficient volume, we may be unable to generate the earnings necessary to implement our growth strategy;\n\uf0b7\nour excess cash reserves and liquid investment securities portfolio, may not be representative of our future cash position;\n\uf0b7\nour historical cost structure and capital expenditure requirements are not necessarily reflective of our anticipated cost structure and capital spending as we continue to identify efficiencies and operate our organic banking platform; and\n\uf0b7\nour regulatory capital ratios, which currently exceed regulatory minimum requirements, are not necessarily representative of our future regulatory capital ratios.\nChanges in general business and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur business and operations are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States and in our two core markets in Colorado and the greater Kansas City region. If the economies in our core markets, or the U.S. economy more generally, experience worsening economic conditions, including industry-specific conditions, we could be materially and adversely affected. Weak economic conditions may be characterized by deflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, including a lack of liquidity and/or depressed prices in the secondary market for mortgage loans, increased delinquencies on loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity, and further or prolonged pressure on energy prices. All of these factors would be detrimental to our business. Our business is significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the U.S. federal government, its agencies and government-sponsored entities. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nChanges in the assumptions underlying our acquisition method of accounting, or other significant accounting estimates could affect our financial information and have a material adverse effect on us.\nA material portion of our financial results is based on, and subject to, significant assumptions and subjective judgments. As a result of our acquisitions, our financial information is heavily influenced by the application of the acquisition method of accounting and was heavily influenced in prior periods by loss share accounting. Both methodologies require us to make complex assumptions, and these assumptions materially affect our financial results. As such, any financial information generated through the use of the acquisition method of accounting or loss share accounting is subject to modification or change. If our assumptions are incorrect and we change or modify our assumptions, it could have a material adverse effect on us or our previously reported results. Additionally, a change in our accounting estimates, such as our ability to realize deferred tax assets, the need for a valuation allowance or the recoverability of the goodwill recorded at the time of our acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur business is highly susceptible to credit risk and fluctuations in the value of real estate and other collateral securing such credit.\nAs a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our clients will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that the collateral securing the payment of their loans (if any) may not be sufficient to assure repayment. The risks inherent in making any loan include risks with respect to the ability of borrowers to repay their loans and, if applicable, the period of time over which the loan is repaid, risks relating to proper loan underwriting and guidelines, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers and risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral. Similarly, we have credit risk embedded in our securities portfolio. Our credit standards, procedures and policies may not prevent us from incurring substantial credit losses, particularly in light of market developments in recent years. A decline in residential real estate market prices and reduced levels of home sales, could adversely affect the value of collateral securing mortgage loans resulting in greater charge-offs in future periods, as well as adversely impact mortgage loan originations and gains on sale of mortgage loans. A decline in commercial real estate values would likewise adversely affect the value of collateral securing certain commercial loans and result in greater charge-offs in future periods. Declines in real estate values and home sales volumes, and financial stress on borrowers as a result of job losses or other factors, could have further adverse effects on borrowers that result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe depend on our executive officers and key personnel to implement our strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nThe execution of our strategy depends in large part on the skills of our executive management team and our ability to motivate and retain these and other key personnel, including key personnel added through mergers and acquisitions. Accordingly, the loss of service of one or more of our executive officers or key personnel could reduce our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy and materially and adversely affect us. Our success also depends on the experience of our banking center managers and relationship managers and on their relationships with the clients and communities they serve. The loss of these key personnel could negatively impact our banking operations. The loss of key senior personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur allowance for loan losses and fair value adjustments may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses inherent in our loan or OREO portfolio.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses (\u201cALL\u201d), which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, which we believe is appropriate to provide for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The amount of this allowance is determined by our management through periodic reviews.\nThe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding our loans, identification of additional problem loans by us and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. If the real estate markets deteriorate, we expect that we will experience increased delinquencies and credit losses, particularly with respect to construction, land development and land loans. In addition, our regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe hold and acquire an amount of OREO from time to time, which may lead to volatility in operating expenses and vulnerability to declines in real property values.\nWhen necessary, we foreclose on and take title to the real estate serving as collateral for our loans as part of our business. Real estate that we own but do not use in the ordinary course of our operations is referred to as OREO property. Higher\nOREO balances as a result of our acquisitions have led to greater expenses as we incur costs to manage and dispose of the properties. We expect that our earnings will continue to be negatively affected by various expenses associated with OREO, including personnel costs, insurance and taxes, completion and repair costs, valuation adjustments and other expenses associated with property ownership, as well as by the funding costs associated with OREO assets. We evaluate OREO properties periodically and write down the carrying value of the properties if the results of our evaluation require it. The expenses associated with OREO and any further OREO write-downs could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans. There is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties, and we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on nonresidential real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe expanding body of federal, state and local regulation of loan servicing, collections or other aspects of our business may increase the cost of compliance and the risks of noncompliance.\nWe service our own loans, and loan servicing is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities as well as to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on those activities. The volume of new or modified laws and regulations has increased in recent years and, in addition, some individual municipalities have begun to enact laws that restrict loan servicing activities including delaying or temporarily preventing foreclosures or forcing the modification of certain mortgages. If regulators impose new or more restrictive requirements, we may incur additional significant costs to comply with such requirements which may further adversely affect us. In addition, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could possibly lead to: civil and criminal liability; damage to our reputation in the industry; fines and penalties and litigation, including class action lawsuits; and administrative enforcement actions. Any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to market conditions outside of our control.\nWe have historically taken a conservative investment strategy with our securities portfolio, with concentrations of securities that are primarily backed by government sponsored enterprises. In the future, we may seek to increase yields through more aggressive strategies, which may include a greater percentage of corporate securities and structured credit products. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, and changes in market interest rates and instability in the capital markets. These factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could have a material adverse effect on us. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security.\nWe face significant competition from other financial institutions and financial services providers, which may materially and adversely affect us.\nConsumer and commercial banking is highly competitive. Our markets contain a large number of community and regional banks as well as a significant presence of the country\u2019s largest commercial banks. We compete with other state and national financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, savings banks and credit unions, for deposits and loans. In addition, we compete with financial intermediaries, such as consumer finance companies, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, securities firms, mutual funds and several government agencies, as well as major retailers, in providing various types of loans and other financial services. Some of these competitors have a long history of successful operations in our markets, greater ties to local businesses and more expansive banking relationships, as well as better established depositor bases. Some of our competitors also have greater resources and access to capital and possess an advantage by being capable of maintaining numerous banking locations in more convenient sites, operating more ATMs and conducting extensive promotional and advertising campaigns or operating a more developed internet platform. Competitors may also exhibit a greater tolerance for risk and behave more aggressively with respect to pricing in order to increase their market share. In addition, the effects of disintermediation can also impact the banking business because of the fast growing body of FinTech companies that use software to deliver mortgage lending, payment services and other financial services.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among others:\n\uf0b7\nthe ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term client relationships based on quality service, effective and efficient products and services, high ethical standards and safe and sound assets;\n\uf0b7\nthe scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet client needs and demands;\n\uf0b7\nthe rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n\uf0b7\nthe ability to attract and retain highly qualified associates to operate our business;\n\uf0b7\nthe ability to expand our market position;\n\uf0b7\nclient satisfaction with our level of service;\n\uf0b7\nthe ability to invest in new technologies;\n\uf0b7\nthe ability to operate our business effectively and efficiently; and\n\uf0b7\nindustry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of deposit withdrawals and other business needs unless we maintain sufficient liquidity.\nWe require liquidity to make loans and to repay deposit and other liabilities as they become due or are demanded by clients. We principally depend on checking, savings and money market deposit account balances and other forms of client deposits as our primary source of funding for our lending activities. As a result of a decline in overall depositor confidence, an increase in interest rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, higher returns being available to clients on alternative investments and general economic conditions, a substantial number of our clients could withdraw their bank deposits with us from time to time, resulting in our deposit levels decreasing substantially, and our cash on hand may not be able to cover such withdrawals and our other business needs, including amounts necessary to operate and grow our business. This would require us to seek third party funding or other sources of liquidity, such as asset sales. Our access to third party funding sources, including our ability to raise funds through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity or equity-related securities, incurrence of debt, and federal funds purchased, may be impacted by our financial strength, performance and prospects and may also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry, all of which may make potential funding sources more difficult to access, less reliable and more expensive. We may not have access to third party funding in sufficient amounts on favorable terms, or the ability to undertake asset sales or access other sources of liquidity, when needed, or at all, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nLike other financial services institutions, our asset and liability structures are monetary in nature. Such structures are affected by a variety of factors, including changes in interest rates, which can impact the value of financial instruments held by us.\nLike other financial services institutions, we have asset and liability structures that are essentially monetary in nature and are directly affected by many factors, including domestic and international economic and political conditions, broad trends in business and finance, legislation and regulation affecting the national and international business and financial communities, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation, currency values, market conditions, the availability and terms (including cost) of short-term or long-term funding and capital, the credit capacity or perceived creditworthiness of clients and counterparties and the level and volatility of trading markets. Such factors can impact clients and counterparties of a financial services institution and may impact the value of financial instruments held by a financial services institution.\nOur earnings and cash flows largely depend upon the level of our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on loans, investments and other interest earning assets, and the interest we pay on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently and at different times to market interest rate changes, changes in interest rates can increase or decrease our net interest income. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates would reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, and because the magnitude of repricing of interest earning assets is often greater than interest bearing liabilities, falling interest rates would reduce net interest income.\nAccordingly, changes in the level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest earning assets and liabilities, loan and investment securities portfolios and our overall results. Changes in interest rates may also have a significant impact on any future loan origination revenues. Historically, there has been an inverse correlation between the demand for loans and interest rates. Loan origination volume and revenues usually decline during periods of rising or high interest rates and increase during periods of declining or low interest rates. Changes in interest rates also have a significant impact on the carrying value of a significant percentage of the assets, both loans and investment securities, on our balance sheet. We may incur debt in the future and that debt may also be sensitive to interest rates and any increase in interest rates could materially and adversely affect us. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. Changes in the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policies or other changes in monetary policies and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party providers, and systems failures or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party providers. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of client business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nA failure in or breach of our security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party providers, could result in financial losses to us or in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, including client information, and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAs a financial institution, we may be the target of fraudulent activity that may result in financial losses to us or our clients, privacy breaches against our clients or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, unauthorized intrusion into or use of our systems, ATM skimming or jackpotting, and other dishonest acts. We provide our clients with the ability to bank remotely, including via online, mobile\nand phone. The secure transmission of confidential information over the internet and other remote channels is a critical element of remote banking.\nOur network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, ransomware and other security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. Given the increasingly high volume of our transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they can be discovered and rectified. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our clients involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to reputational damage, claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing clients to lose confidence in our systems and could materially and adversely affect us. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of the threats from organized cybercriminals and hackers, and our plans to continue to provide digital banking products and services to our clients.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others. In addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions, particularly denial of service attacks, that are designed to disrupt key business services, such as client-facing web sites. We are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. We employ detection and response mechanisms designed to contain and mitigate security incidents, but early detection may be thwarted by sophisticated attacks and malware designed to avoid detection.\nWe also face risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with credit or debit card, including ATM-related, transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding our clients through various third parties, including merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, payment card networks (e.g., Visa, MasterCard) and our processors. Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks, and because the transactions involve third parties and environments such as the point of sale that we do not control or secure, future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third parties could impact us through no fault of our own, and in some cases we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them. We also rely on numerous other third party service providers to conduct other aspects of our business operations and face similar risks relating to them. While we regularly conduct security assessments on these third parties, we cannot be sure that their information security protocols are sufficient to withstand a cyber-attack or other security breach.\nRisks Relating to our Growth Strategy\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth.\nOur future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully manage our growth. Our growth has placed, and it may continue to place, significant demands on our operations and management. Whether through additional acquisitions or organic growth, our current plan to expand our business is dependent upon our ability to:\n\uf0b7\ncontinue to implement and improve our operational, credit, financial, legal, management and other internal risk controls and processes and our reporting systems and procedures in order to manage a growing number of client relationships;\n\uf0b7\nscale our technology platform;\n\uf0b7\nintegrate our acquisitions and develop consistent policies throughout the various lines of businesses; and\n\uf0b7\nattract and retain management talent.\nWe may not successfully implement improvements to, or integrate, our management information and control systems, procedures and processes in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. In particular, our controls and procedures must be able to accommodate an increase in loan volume in various markets and the\ninfrastructure that comes with new banking centers and banks. Thus, our growth strategy may divert management from our existing franchises and may require us to incur additional expenditures to expand our administrative and operational infrastructure and, if we are unable to effectively manage and grow our financial services franchise, we could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to manage future expansion in our operations, we may experience compliance and operational problems, have to slow the pace of growth, or have to incur additional expenditures beyond current projections to support such growth, any one of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur acquisitions generally will require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them would restrict our growth.\nWe intend to complement and expand our business by pursuing strategic acquisitions of financial services franchises. Generally, any acquisition of target financial institutions, banking centers or other banking assets by us will require approval by, and cooperation from, a number of governmental regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and Colorado Division of Banking. In acting on applications, our banking regulators consider, among other factors:\n\uf0b7\nthe effect of the acquisition on competition;\n\uf0b7\nthe financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, capital levels and future prospects of the applicant and the bank(s) involved;\n\uf0b7\nthe quantity and complexity of previously consummated acquisitions;\n\uf0b7\nthe managerial resources of the applicant and the bank(s) involved;\n\uf0b7\nthe convenience and needs of the community, including the record of performance under the Community Reinvestment Act (which we refer to as the \u201cCRA\u201d); and\n\uf0b7\nthe effectiveness of the applicant in combating money laundering activities.\nSuch regulators could deny our application based on the above criteria or other considerations, which would restrict our growth, or the regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us. For example, we could be required to sell banking centers as a condition to receiving regulatory approvals, and such a condition may not be acceptable to us or may reduce the benefit of any acquisition. In addition, prior to the submission of an application our regulators could discourage us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or indicate that regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that would be acceptable to us, which could have the same effect of restricting our growth or reducing the benefit of any acquisitions.\nThe success of future transactions will depend on our ability to successfully identify and consummate acquisitions of financial services franchises that meet our investment objectives. Because of the intense competition for acquisition opportunities and the limited number of potential targets, we may not be able to successfully consummate acquisitions on attractive terms.\nThere are significant risks associated with our strategy to identify and successfully consummate acquisitions. There are a limited number of acquisition opportunities, and we expect to encounter intense competition from other banking organizations competing for acquisitions and also from other investment funds and entities looking to acquire financial institutions and financial services franchises. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and consummating acquisitions directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess ongoing banking operations with greater financial, technical, human and other resources and access to capital than we do, which could limit the acquisition opportunities we pursue. Our competitors may be able to achieve greater cost savings, through consolidating operations or otherwise, than we could. These competitive limitations give others an advantage in pursuing certain acquisitions. In addition, increased competition may drive up the prices for the acquisitions we pursue and make the other acquisition terms more onerous, which would make the identification and successful consummation of those acquisitions less attractive to us. Competitors may be willing to pay more for acquisitions than we believe are justified, which could result in us having to pay more for them than we prefer or to forego the opportunity. The trading price of our common stock and of the stock of other potential acquirers may affect our ability to offer a competitive price for acquisitions where stock is proposed as acquisition consideration. As a result of the foregoing, we may be unable to successfully identify and consummate acquisitions on attractive terms, or at all, that are necessary to grow our business.\nTo the extent that we are unable to identify and consummate attractive acquisitions, or continue to increase loans through organic loan growth, we may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe intend to continue to grow our business through strategic acquisitions of financial services franchises coupled with organic loan growth. Previous availability of attractive acquisition targets may not be indicative of future acquisition opportunities, and we may be unable to identify any acquisition targets that meet our investment objectives. As our acquired loan portfolio, which generally produces higher yields than our originated loans due to loan discounts and accretable yield, is paid down, we expect downward pressure on our income to the extent that the runoff is not replaced with other high-yielding loans. As a result of the foregoing, if we are unable to replace loans in our existing portfolio with comparable high-yielding loans, we could be materially and adversely affected. We could also be materially and adversely affected if we choose to pursue riskier higher-yielding loans that fail to perform.\nProjected operating results for businesses acquired by us may be inaccurate and may vary significantly from actual results. To the extent that we make acquisitions that involve distressed assets, we may not be able to realize the value we predict from these assets or make sufficient provision for future losses in the value of, or accurately estimate the future writedowns to be taken in respect of, these assets.\nWe will generally establish the pricing of transactions and the capital structure of financial services franchises to be acquired by us on the basis of financial projections for such financial services franchises. In general, projected operating results will be based on the judgment of our management team. In all cases, projections are only estimates of future results that are based upon assumptions made at the time that the projections are developed and the projected results may vary significantly from actual results. General economic, political and market conditions can have a material adverse impact on the reliability of such projections. In the event that the projections made in connection with our acquisitions, or future projections with respect to new acquisitions, are not accurate, such inaccuracies could materially and adversely affect us.\nDelinquencies and losses in the loan portfolios and other assets we acquire may exceed our initial forecasts developed during our due diligence investigation prior to their acquisition and, thus, produce lower returns than we believed our purchase price supported. Furthermore, our due diligence investigation may not reveal all material issues. If, during the diligence process, we fail to identify all relevant issues related to an acquisition, we may be forced to later write down or write off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in significant losses. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect us. Economic conditions may create an uncertain environment with respect to asset valuations and there is no certainty that we will be able to sell assets or institutions after we acquire them if we determine it would be in our best interests to do so. In addition, there may be limited liquidity for certain asset classes we hold, including commercial real estate and construction and development loans. Any of the foregoing matters could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe face additional risks due to our increased mortgage banking activities that could negatively impact net income and profitability.\nWe sell substantially all of the mortgage loans that we originate. The sale of these loans generates non-interest income and can be a source of liquidity for the Bank. Disruption in the secondary market for residential mortgage loans as well as declines in real estate values could result in one or more of the following:\n\uf0b7\nour inability to sell mortgage loans on the secondary market, which could negatively impact our liquidity position;\n\uf0b7\ndeclines in real estate values could decrease the potential of mortgage originations, which could negatively impact our earnings;\n\uf0b7\nif it is determined that loans were made in breach of our representations and warranties to the secondary market, we could incur losses associated with the loans;\n\uf0b7\nincreased compliance requirements could result in higher compliance costs, higher foreclosure proceedings or lower loan origination volume, all which could negatively impact future earnings; and\n\uf0b7\na rise in interest rates could cause a decline in mortgage originations, which could negatively impact our earnings.\nOur use of appraisals in deciding whether to make loans secured by real property does not ensure that the value of the real property collateral will be sufficient to repay our loans.\nIn considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, we require an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made and requires the exercise of a considerable degree of judgment. If the appraisal does not accurately reflect the amount that may be obtained upon sale or foreclosure of the property, whether due to a decline in property value after the date of the original appraisal or defective preparation of the appraisal, we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property and as a result, we may suffer losses.\nTax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions and we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments. From time to time, legislative initiatives may be adopted, such as the recent tax reform in the United States, which may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our deferred tax assets, tax positions and/or our tax liabilities. In addition, U.S. federal, state and local tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our historical tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in defending our positions in connection with any such challenge.\nAdditionally, the full impact of \u201cH.R.1\u201d, known as the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d on us and our clients is unknown at present, creating uncertainty and risk related to our clients\u2019 future demand for credit and our future results. Increased economic activity expected to result from the decrease in tax rates on business generally could spur economic activity that would encourage additional borrowing. At the same time, some clients may elect to use their additional cash flow from lower taxes to fund their existing levels of activity, decreasing borrowing needs. The elimination of the federal income tax deductibility of business interest expense for a number of our clients effectively increases the cost of borrowing and makes equity or hybrid funding relatively more attractive. This could have a long-term negative impact on business client borrowing. Further, uncertainty also exists surrounding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u2019s effects on housing markets, mortgage originations, unemployment rates, interest rates and the economies of the markets we serve. Finally, it is unclear how states and other taxing jurisdictions will respond to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nRisks Relating to the Regulation of Our Industry\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 continues to materially affect our business.\nThe key effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business are:\n\uf0b7\nchanges to regulatory capital requirements;\n\uf0b7\ncreation of new government regulatory agencies (such as the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which oversees systemic risk, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which develops and enforces rules for bank and non-bank providers of consumer financial products);\n\uf0b7\npotential limitations on federal preemption;\n\uf0b7\nchanges to deposit insurance assessments;\n\uf0b7\nregulation of debit interchange fees we earn;\n\uf0b7\nchanges in retail banking regulations, including potential limitations on certain fees we may charge; and\n\uf0b7\nchanges in regulation of consumer mortgage loan origination and risk retention.\nSeveral provisions still require regulations to be promulgated by various federal agencies in order to be implemented, some of which have been proposed by the applicable federal agencies. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act have limited our business activities, required changes to certain of our business practices, imposed upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise materially and may continue to adversely affect us. Failure to comply with the requirements could also materially and adversely affect us. Furthermore, additional uncertainties surrounding the Dodd-\nFrank Act, its implementation, and enforcement persist as a result of the current presidential administration. Any changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations could be materially adverse to investors in our common stock.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and legislation by federal and state regulators and bodies that govern almost all aspects of our operations. Intended to protect clients, depositors and the DIF, these laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage (including foreclosure and collection practices), limit the dividends or distributions that we can pay, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt, and impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than GAAP. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could materially and adversely affect us. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive and also materially and adversely affect us.\nThe FDIC\u2019s restoration plan for the DIF and any related increased assessment rates could materially and adversely affect us.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as our subsidiary bank, up to applicable limits. The amount of a particular institution\u2019s deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution\u2019s risk classification under an FDIC risk-based assessment system. An institution\u2019s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to its regulators. If current assessments imposed by the FDIC are insufficient for the DIF to meet its funding requirements, there may need to be further special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. Any future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums may materially and adversely affect us, including by reducing our profitability or limiting our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.\nFederal and state banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we become subject as a result of such examinations could materially and adversely affect us.\nFederal and state banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal or state banking agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we or our management was in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, we could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, and restrictions on expansion activity. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation.\nThe Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support our subsidiary bank.\nAs a matter of policy, the Federal Reserve, which examines us and our subsidiaries, expects a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the federal bank regulators to require that all companies that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution serve as a source of strength for the institution. Under this requirement, we could be required to provide financial assistance to our subsidiary bank should our subsidiary bank experience financial distress.\nA capital injection may be required at times when we do not have the resources to provide it and therefore we may be required to borrow the funds or raise additional equity capital from third parties. Any loans by a holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its indebtedness. Any financing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection may be difficult and expensive and may not be available on attractive terms, or at all, which likely would have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements, and engages in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions (such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans), which could materially and adversely affect us. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nFederal, state and local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans and could increase our cost of doing business.\nFederal, state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered \u201cpredatory.\u201d These laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products, selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers, repeatedly refinancing loans and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property. It is our policy not to make\npredatory loans, but these laws create the potential for liability with respect to our lending and loan investment activities. They increase our cost of doing business and, ultimately, may prevent us from making certain loans and cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that we do make.\nOur ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations and our bank subsidiary\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us is also subject to regulatory limitations.\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends depends both on the ability of our bank subsidiary to pay dividends to us and on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends. Because we are a separate legal entity from our bank subsidiary and we do not have significant operations of our own, any dividends paid by us to our shareholders would have to be paid from funds at the holding company level that are legally available therefor. However, as a bank holding company, we are subject to general regulatory restrictions on the payment of cash dividends. Federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business, which depending on the financial condition and liquidity of the holding company at the time, could include the payment of dividends. Additionally, various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends that our bank subsidiary can pay to us as its holding company without regulatory approval. Finally, holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may, in its unilateral discretion, declare out of funds legally available for such purpose based on a variety of considerations, including, without limitation, our historical and projected financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, capital levels, tax considerations, statutory and regulatory prohibitions and other limitations, general economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Accordingly, we may not pay the amount of dividends referenced in our current intention above, or any dividends at all, to our shareholders in the future.", "PERMNO": 13579, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "NBHC"}
