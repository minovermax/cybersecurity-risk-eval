{"cik": "1366246", "company": "GLU MOBILE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which may affect our future financial performance. If any of the events or circumstances described below occurs, our business and financial performance could be harmed, our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline. The risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face. There may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may harm our business and financial performance. Because of the risks and uncertainties discussed below, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nWe have a history of net losses, may incur substantial net losses in the future and may not achieve and sustain profitability or growth in future periods.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception, including a net loss of $7.2 million in 2015 and a net loss of $87.4 million in 2016. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $338.7 million. While we have conducted several restructurings between December 2015 and January 2017 aimed at reducing our fixed costs and operating more efficiently, our costs may continue to rise as we implement additional initiatives designed to increase revenue, including: investing more heavily in our existing titles as part of our platform strategy; hiring additional staff in our San Francisco Bay Area and Hyderabad, India locations, including new creative leaders and their teams; developing new games with greater complexity, higher production values and deeper social features; running live operations on our games; and taking other steps to strengthen our company. We anticipate that the costs of acquiring new players and otherwise marketing our new titles will continue to rise (particularly since advertising costs in our industry have generally been rising and downloads of our games are decreasing as users spend more time on alternative software applications, such as social media, messaging, and streaming applications), and we may continue to incur significant costs to acquire rights to third party intellectual property, including incurring significant minimum guaranteed royalty payments. If our revenue does not increase at a rate sufficient to offset these additional expenses, if the launch dates for our games are delayed, if we experience unexpected significant increases in operating expenses or if we are required to take additional charges related to impairments or restructurings we will continue to incur losses. For example during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 we recorded a $14.5 million royalty impairment related to the prepaid guaranteed royalty and license fee payments that we have made to an affiliate of Tencent Holdings Limited, or Tencent, related to our Rival Fire game and a $20.2 million impairment related to certain contractual minimum guarantee payments made to certain of our celebrity licensors and other prepaid royalties. We have also taken restructuring charges in the past, including $2.3 million during 2016 following our headcount reductions initiated in April 2016 and we expect further restructuring charges of approximately $4.3 million to $4.7 million in total during the first and second quarters of 2017 related to our January 2017 restructuring. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2016 we recorded a charge of $2.4 million due to a decline in the fair market value of our call option for Plain Vanilla and a charge of $1.9 million due to a decrease in the fair value of the promissory notes issued to us by Plain Vanilla. Furthermore, given the declines in overall downloads of mobile gaming applications, the marked decline in gaming applications as compared to all mobile gaming applications generally, and the significant amount of time and attention users are dedicating to social media and other non-gaming applications, increasing revenue has been, and may continue to be, challenging. This industry trend has been negatively impacting us, as the number of downloads of sequels to certain of our most successful franchises, including the launches of Deer Hunter 2016 (which we have recently rebranded Deer Hunter 2017) and Eternity Warriors 4, as well as for our more recent titles, such as Nicki Minaj: The Empire, Britney Spears: American Dream, Gordon Ramsay DASH, and Rival Fire have downloaded at significantly lower rates as compared to predecessor versions and previous new titles.\nIf we fail to develop and publish new mobile games that achieve market acceptance, as well as continue to enhance our existing games, particularly our most successful games, our revenue would suffer.\nOur business depends on developing and publishing mobile games that consumers will download and spend time and money playing. We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, technology, analytics and marketing to introduce new games and continue to update our successful free-to-play games, and we often must make\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ndecisions about these matters well in advance of a product release to timely implement them. Our success depends, in part, on unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, including consumer preferences and the number of applications they are willing to download to and maintain on their devices, competing gaming and non-gaming related applications, new mobile platforms and the availability of other entertainment activities. If our games do not meet consumer expectations, or they are not brought to market in a timely and effective manner, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. Historically, we have focused on developing and publishing shooters and other action games primarily directed at male audiences. However, our recent releases in this genre, which includes Deer Hunter 2017 and Rival Fire, have failed to download or monetize at the same rates as some of our legacy titles, including Deer Hunter 2014 (which we have recently rebranded Deer Hunter Classic). While our Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, Cooking Dash 2016 and Gordon Ramsay DASH titles have been commercially successful, our Katy Perry Pop, Britney Spears: American Dream and Nicki Minaj: The Empire games have not been, and meeting consumer expectations could prove more challenging for us in the future as we release additional games that are primarily targeted toward female audiences, such as our upcoming title featuring Taylor Swift. Even if our games are successfully introduced and initially adopted, a failure to continually update them with compelling content or a subsequent shift in the entertainment preferences of consumers could cause a decline in our games\u2019 popularity that could materially reduce our revenue and harm our business, operating results and financial condition, which effect would be magnified for our most successful games. It is difficult to predict when and how quickly the popularity and revenue of one of our games will decline. In particular, in connection with our platform and evergreen games strategy, we expect to commit more resources to updating, adding new features to and enhancing our existing titles as opposed to launching as many new titles as we have in prior years. However, we may not be successful in updating our existing titles in our efforts to create platform and evergreen titles, such as the case with our recent updates of Covet Fashion and Racing Rivals which were received poorly by some of our players and, in the case of Racing Rivals, resulted in decreased revenue. As a result of the life cycle of our games, our business depends on our ability to consistently and timely launch new games and updates to existing games that achieve significant popularity, and have the potential to become platforms. If, as we anticipate, we launch fewer titles in 2017 as compared to prior years, we may be less likely to launch a game that achieves significant commercial success, and if the titles we expect to launch in 2017 are not launched on time or do not meet consumer expectations, our ability to grow revenue and our financial performance will be negatively affected. For example, we experienced delays in the introduction of Rival Fire and our upcoming Taylor Swift title, which had a negative impact on our financial results during 2016. If rates of revenue decline are higher than expected in a particular quarterly period, the new games we launch fail to download and/or monetize as we anticipate, or the enhancements we make to existing titles do not result in decreased rates of revenue decline, we may not meet our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts or investors for a given quarter. In addition, our Kim Kardashian: Hollywood game benefitted significantly from awareness of the game through media coverage and social media channels, and such viral success can be difficult to predict or to repeat in the future, or as in the case of Kendall & Kylie, may not translate into the level of sustained commercial success we experienced with Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. Furthermore, we compete for the discretionary spending of consumers, who face a vast array of entertainment choices, including social media and other non-gaming related apps, games played on personal computers and consoles, television, movies, sports and the Internet. If we are unable to sustain sufficient interest in our games compared to other forms of entertainment, our business and financial results would be seriously harmed.\nIn addition to the market factors noted above, our ability to successfully develop games for mobile devices and their ability to achieve commercial success will depend on our ability to:\n\u00b7\nachieve a positive return on investment from our marketing and user acquisition efforts;\n\u00b7\nminimize launch delays and cost overruns on the development of new games;\n\u00b7\neffectively monetize our games;\n\u00b7\nrelease games compatible with an increasingly diverse set of mobile devices;\n\u00b7\nminimize and quickly resolve bugs or outages; and\n\u00b7\nacquire and successfully integrate high quality mobile game assets, personnel or companies.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThese and other uncertainties make it difficult to know whether we will succeed in continuing to develop successful mobile games and launch these games in accordance with our operating plan. If we do not succeed in doing so, our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation will suffer.\nSuccessfully developing and monetizing free-to-play games is a challenging business model.\nWe face significant challenges in achieving our goal of become the leading developer and publisher of free-to-play mobile games. The most successful launches of free-to-play games tend to include socio-competitive gameplay, player versus player activities, regularly updated content and other complex technological and creative attributes associated with our platform and evergreen offerings. While we are working to include such features in our games through our platform and evergreen strategy, we may not successfully update our games to include these features. For example, the significant update to Racing Rivals that we released in the fourth quarter of 2016 was poorly received by players and led to a significant decline in revenue from this title. Additionally, our existing games compete with our new offerings and the offerings of our competitors, and revenue from our existing games have declined over time, a trend that we have limited experience reversing on a consistent basis. In addition, following the success of our Kim Kardashian: Hollywood game, we expanded our efforts to build the premier celebrity gaming platform and partnered with A-list celebrities to selectively collaborate on future games. In 2015 and 2016, we released Katy Perry Pop, Kendall & Kylie, Britney Spears: American Dream and Nicki Minaj: The Empire. However, these titles ultimately did not achieve the level of success we experienced with Kim Kardashian: Hollywood which has resulted in a shift in our strategy away from celebrity games that are primarily role playing games. If we are unable to create innovative games that surprise and delight our players, we may continue to experience similar results with our forthcoming title featuring Taylor Swift, our revenue could be limited, and our business and operating results would suffer. We are also focusing our efforts on making our existing successful games into platforms or evergreen titles by adding new features, modes and community-enhancing features. However, this is a strategy with which we have limited experience and have not always successfully implemented as evidenced by our recent Covet Fashion and Racing Rivals updates. If we are unable to successfully implement this strategy, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our financial performance and ability to grow revenue would be negatively affected, and we may be unable to launch successful new titles due to a diversion of talent and resources to our existing platform and evergreen titles. Our efforts to develop free-to-play games, celebrity and other licensed property games, enhance our existing titles and our transition towards focusing on creating and maintaining successful platforms may prove unsuccessful or, even if successful, it may take more time than we anticipate to achieve significant revenue because, among other reasons:\n\u00b7\nour free-to-play strategy assumes that a large number of players will download our games because they are free and that we will then be able to effectively monetize the games; however, players may not widely download our games for a variety of reasons, including\n\u00b7\ncompetition for downloads not only with other mobile games but also with social media and other non-gaming related applications;\n\u00b7\nlimits on the number of mobile applications players are willing to download to and maintain on their devices;\n\u00b7\npoor consumer reviews or other negative publicity;\n\u00b7\nineffective or insufficient marketing efforts;\n\u00b7\nlack of sufficient social and community features;\n\u00b7\nlack of prominent storefront featuring;\n\u00b7\nfailure to reach and maintain Top Free App Store rankings;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nthe relatively large file size of some of our games, which has been exacerbated due to Apple\u2019s requirement that games released on the Apple App Store include 64-bit support; in particular, our games often utilize a significant amount of the available memory on a user\u2019s device and tend to consume additional space as players advance through our games, which may cause players to delete our games once the file size grows beyond the capacity of their devices\u2019 storage limitations; and\n\u00b7\nthe inherent limitations of the smartphone platforms and telecommunications networks, which at most only allow applications that are less than 100 megabytes to be downloaded over a carrier\u2019s wireless network; as a result, players must download our games that exceed 100 megabytes either via a wireless Internet (wifi) connection or initially to their computer and then side-load them to their device;\n\u00b7\neven if our games are widely downloaded, we may fail to retain users or optimize the monetization of these games, such as has been the case with our Kendall & Kylie title, which may occur for a variety of reasons, including poor game design or quality, lack of socio-competitive features, gameplay issues such as game unavailability, long load times or an unexpected termination of the game due to data server or other technical issues, lack of differentiation from predecessor games or other competitive games, lack of innovative features that surprise and delight our players, differences in user demographics and purchasing power or our failure to effectively respond and adapt to changing user preferences through game updates;\n\u00b7\nfuture celebrity and other licensed property games that we release may fail to resonate with consumers, may cannibalize revenue from our existing games, and may cost more to build than other titles due to the minimum guaranteed royalty payments to our celebrity licensors and due to the need to differentiate gameplay among titles featuring celebrities. It is unclear whether future celebrity-based games have the potential to generate revenue at levels similar to our Kim Kardashian: Hollywood title or whether these games can be successful at all, including that the number of social media followers for a particular celebrity may have limited impact on the financial success of a title (as occurred with our Katy Perry Pop, Britney Spears: American Dream and Nicki Minaj: The Empire titles) or the number of initial downloads may not result in significant financial success on a sustained basis (as occurred with our Kendall & Kylie title);\n\u00b7\nwe intend to continue to develop games based upon our own intellectual property, rather than celebrities or well-known licensed brands and properties, and we may encounter difficulties in generating sufficient consumer interest in and downloads of our games, particularly considering we have experienced significantly fewer downloads of recent launches of game sequels as compared to their predecessors;\n\u00b7\nmany well-funded public and private companies have released, or plan to release, free-to-play games, including games incorporating celebrities or other well-known licensed brands or properties, and this competition will make it more difficult for us to differentiate our games and derive significant revenue from them;\n\u00b7\nwe may have difficulty hiring proven creative leaders and the experienced monetization, live operations, server technology, user experience and product management personnel that we require to support our platform and evergreen gaming strategy, or may face difficulties in developing our technology platform and incorporating it into our products or developing unique gameplay;\n\u00b7\nwe will depend on the proper and continued functioning of our own servers and third-party infrastructure to operate our connected games that are delivered as a service; and\n\u00b7\nthe Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, has indicated that it intends to review issues related to in-app purchases, particularly with respect to games that are marketed primarily to minors (for example, the FTC reached a settlement with Apple in January 2014 and with Google in September 2014 on this issue, and in April 2016, a federal court granted summary judgment in favor of the FTC finding Amazon liable for unfairly billing consumers for unauthorized in-app purchases by minors), and the FTC might issue rules significantly restricting or even prohibiting in-app purchases or name us as a defendant in a future class-action lawsuit.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf we do not achieve a sufficient return on our investment with respect to our free-to-play business model, it will negatively affect our operating results and may require us to formulate a new business strategy.\nWe rely on a very small portion of our total players for nearly all of our revenue that we derive from in-app purchases.\nWe rely on a very small portion of our total players for nearly all of our revenue derived from in-app purchases (as opposed to advertisements and incentivized offers) and installation rates and user-growth have declined for us with many of our recent product launches. Since the launch of our first free-to-play titles in the fourth quarter of 2010, the percentage of unique paying players for our largest revenue-generating free-to-play games has typically been less than 2%, when measured as the number of unique paying users on a given day divided by the number of unique users on that day, though this percentage fluctuates, and it may be higher than 2% for some of our games during specific, relatively short time periods, such as immediately following worldwide launch or the week following content updates, marketing campaigns or certain other events. To significantly increase our revenue, we must increase the number of downloads of our games, increase the number of players who convert into paying players by making in-app purchases or enrolling in subscriptions, increase the amount that our paying players spend in our games and/or increase the length of time our players generally play our games. We might not succeed in our efforts to increase the monetization rates of our users, particularly if we do not increase the amount of social features in our games or otherwise succeed in our platform and evergreen gaming strategy. We have also encountered difficulties in retaining our players as the average monthly active users, or MAU, for our games declined 27% from 49.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 35.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. If we are unable to convert non-paying players into paying players, or if we are unable to retain our paying players or if the average amount of revenue that we generate from our players does not increase or declines, our business may not grow, our financial results will suffer, and our stock price may decline.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from Apple\u2019s App Store and the Google Play Store, and if we are unable to maintain a good relationship with each of Apple and Google or if either of these storefronts were unavailable for any prolonged period of time, our business will suffer.\nThe majority of our smartphone revenue has historically been derived from Apple\u2019s iOS platform, which accounted for 62.4% of our total revenue for 2016 compared with 60.5% and 61.8% of our total revenue for 2015 and 2014, respectively. We generated the majority of this iOS-related revenue from the Apple App Store, which represented 52.7%, 51.7% and 52.2% of our total revenue 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with the significant majority of such revenue derived from in-app purchases. We generated the balance of our iOS-related revenue from offers and advertisements in games distributed on the Apple App Store and, to a far lesser extent, sales of premium games. In addition, we derived approximately 36.1%, 38.1% and 35.4% of our total revenue for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, from the Android platform. We generated the majority of our Android-related revenue from the Google Play Store, which represented 27.6%, 27.4% and 24.8% of our total revenue for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with the significant majority of such revenue derived from in-app purchases. We believe that we have good relationships with each of Apple and Google, which have contributed to the majority of our games released in the last several years being featured on their respective storefronts upon commercial release. If we do not continue to receive prominent featuring, users may find it more difficult to discover our games and we may not generate significant revenue from them. We may also be required to spend significantly more on marketing campaigns to generate substantial revenue on these platforms. For example, in the second half of 2016, Apple began displaying paid search advertisements for applications in the Apple App Store search results for the first time. We have purchased, and may continue to purchase, such advertising to ensure the prominence of our games in the Apple App Store which could result in our marketing expenses increasing significantly. Additionally, our efforts to advertise through search advertisements in the Apple App Store may not be successful and may not result in additional users or monetization. In addition, currently neither Apple nor Google charge a publisher when it features one of their apps. If either Apple or Google were to charge publishers to feature an app, it could cause our marketing expenses to increase considerably. Accordingly, any change or deterioration in our relationship with Apple or Google could materially harm our business and likely cause our stock price to decline.\nWe also rely on the continued functioning of the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. In the past these digital storefronts have been unavailable for short periods of time or experienced issues with their in-app purchasing functionality. For example, on March 11, 2015, the Apple App Store experienced an approximately 12-hour global\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\noutage, which resulted in players and potential players of our games being unable to both download our games and make in-app purchases within our games during such outage. If such events recur on a prolonged basis or other similar issues arise that impact our ability to generate revenue from these storefronts, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results. In addition, if these storefront operators fail to provide high levels of service, our players\u2019 ability to access our games may be interrupted or players may not receive the virtual currency or goods for which they have paid, which may adversely affect our brand.\nThe operators of digital storefronts on which we publish our free-to-play games and the advertising channels through which we acquire some of our players in many cases have the unilateral ability to change and interpret the terms of our and others\u2019 contracts with them.\nWe distribute our free-to-play games through direct-to-consumer digital storefronts, for which the distribution terms and conditions are often \u201cclick through\u201d agreements that we are not able to negotiate with the storefront operator. For example, we are subject to each of Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s standard click-through terms and conditions for application developers, which govern the promotion, distribution and operation of apps, including our games, on their storefronts. Each of Apple and Google can unilaterally change its standard terms and conditions with no prior notice to us. In addition, the agreement terms can be vague and subject to changing interpretations by the storefront operator. Further, these storefront operators typically have the right to prohibit a developer from distributing its applications on its storefront if the developer violates its standard terms and conditions. For example, in the second quarter of 2011, Apple began prohibiting virtual currency-incented advertising offers in games that directed users to download other applications from the Apple App Store in order to complete the offer. These offers accounted for approximately one-third of our smartphone revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2011, and our inability to subsequently use such offers negatively impacted our smartphone revenue thereafter. In addition, Apple informed us early in the fourth quarter of 2012 that we could no longer include links to Tapjoy\u2019s HTML5 website in our games, which negatively impacted our ability to generate revenue through incented offers. Apple has implemented restrictions related to games that include guns, including changing its game rating methodology, which has resulted in all of our games that include gun violence receiving a 17+ rating, and prohibiting some depictions of guns in game icons and other storefront art; these restrictions, could potentially negatively impact the number of people playing these \u201cshooter\u201d games and the revenue we generate from these games. During the second quarter of 2014, there were reports that Apple was considering prohibiting some types of virtual currency-incented video advertising in games that promoted other applications available on the Apple App Store. These incented video advertisements generate a meaningful percentage of our overall revenue, and any prohibition of these advertisements would have had a negative impact on our revenue. In the fourth quarter of 2014, Apple informed developers that beginning on February 1, 2015 all new applications, and beginning June 1, 2015 all updates to existing applications, submitted to the Apple App Store must include 64-bit support. We did not previously build our games to include 64-bit support nor did the Unity development engine that we utilize to create many of our games support 64-bit development; however, we worked with Unity to ensure that we met Apple\u2019s requirement. Building our games to support 64-bit development has increased the file sizes of our games making it more difficult for players to download our games and potentially negatively impacting the number of downloads and active users of our titles, particularly for those games where we are unable to keep file sizes below 100 megabytes, which is the maximum file size that can currently be downloaded over any carrier\u2019s wireless network (requiring download over wifi networks). In addition, we believe that Apple may have made changes to its algorithms that determine the App Store\u2019s Top Free application rankings, as games currently have a more difficult time achieving and maintaining Top Free rankings than has historically been the case. The Top Free rankings are one of the primary means for consumers to discover our games, and to the extent that algorithm changes have occurred that make it more difficult for mobile games to reach and maintain Top Free spots, it would contribute to fewer installs of our games. If Apple or Google, or any other key storefront operator, determines that we or one of our key vendors are violating its standard terms and conditions, by a new interpretation or otherwise, or prohibits us from distributing our games on its storefront, it would materially harm our business and likely cause our stock price to significantly decline.\nIn addition, in the first quarter of 2014, Facebook prohibited HasOffers, whose software development kit we had incorporated into our games to track advertising metrics, from participating in Facebook\u2019s mobile measurement program because Facebook asserted that HasOffers had violated its agreement with Facebook. As a result, we removed HasOffers\u2019 software development kit from our games and replaced it with software from a new vendor. While this change did not\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nadversely impact our revenue or operations, any similar changes or prohibitions in the future could negatively impact our revenue or otherwise materially harm our business, and we may not receive significant or any advance warning of such changes.\nOur financial results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict, which in turn could cause volatility in our stock price.\nOur revenue and operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. In addition, we may not be able to accurately predict our future revenue or results of operations. We base our current and future expense levels on our internal operating plans and sales forecasts, and our operating costs are to a large extent fixed. As a result, we may not be able to reduce our costs sufficiently to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenue, and even a small shortfall in revenue could disproportionately and adversely affect financial results for that quarter.\nIn addition to other risk factors discussed in this section, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly results include:\n\u00b7\nour ability to increase the number of our paying players and the amount that each paying player spends in our games;\n\u00b7\nthe popularity and monetization rates of our new games released during the quarter and the ability of games released in prior periods to sustain their popularity and monetization rates;\n\u00b7\nthe number and timing of new games released by us and our competitors, particularly those games that may represent a significant portion of revenue in a quarter, which timing can be impacted by internal development delays, shifts in product strategy and how quickly digital storefront operators review and approve our games for commercial release, a factor which may be particularly important in 2017 as we may release as few as two new titles this year;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the prominence of storefront featuring for our games and those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nthe loss of, or changes to, one of our distribution platforms;\n\u00b7\nchanges to the Apple iOS platform or the Google Android platform that we are not able to adapt to our game offerings;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in the size and rate of growth of overall consumer demand for smartphones, tablets, games and related content;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of charges related to any future impairments of goodwill, intangible assets, prepaid royalties and guarantees; for example, in 2016, we impaired $14.5 million related to prepaid royalty commitments and license fees paid to an affiliate of Tencent in connection with our Rival Fire title, $20.2 million related to contractual minimum guarantee royalty payments made to certain celebrity licensors and other prepaid royalties, $2.4 million related to the impairment of our call option in Plain Vanilla, and $1.9 million related to a decline in the fair value of the promissory notes issued to us by Plain Vanilla, and in future periods we may be required to impair our goodwill due to further declines in our business and/or stock price, especially as our fair value increasingly approaches our carrying value (See Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements), or take additional large impairments related to contractual minimum guarantee commitments if the associated games we are developing are not successful;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nchanges in the mix of revenue derived from games based on original intellectual property versus licensed intellectual property (including that we currently anticipate that a majority, and potentially all, of our title launches in 2017 will be based on or will significantly incorporate licensed intellectual property rather than being wholly original Glu intellectual property games);\n\u00b7\nchanges in the mix of revenue derived from in-app purchases, advertisements and offers, which mix often depends on the nature of new titles launched during the quarter;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the mix of revenue derived from first party titles and third party titles, including revenue from Racing Rivals now that we have transitioned development for this title to Carbonated;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the amount of money we spend marketing our titles in a particular quarter, including the average amount we pay to acquire each new user, as well as changes in the timing of these marketing expenses within the quarter;\n\u00b7\ndecisions by us to incur additional expenses, such as increases in research and development, restructuring expenses, or unanticipated increases in vendor-related costs, such as hosting fees;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of successful mobile device launches;\n\u00b7\nthe seasonality of our industry;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting rules, such as those governing recognition of revenue, including the period of time over which we recognize revenue for in-app purchases of virtual currency and goods within some of our games, as well as estimates of average playing periods and player life; and\n\u00b7\nmacro-economic fluctuations in the United States and global economies, including those that impact discretionary consumer spending.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and many of our competitors have significantly greater resources than we do.\nDeveloping, distributing and selling mobile games is a highly competitive business, characterized by frequent product introductions and rapidly emerging new platforms, technologies and storefronts. For players, we compete primarily on the basis of game quality, brand and customer reviews. We compete for space on user\u2019s smartphones and tablet devices in terms of the number of applications on their device and the amount of storage consumed by such applications. We also compete more generally for the time and attention of users of smartphones and tablet devices who are spending ever-increasing amounts of time on social media, messaging and music, movie and television streaming applications. We compete for promotional and digital storefront placement based on our relationship with the digital storefront owner, historical performance, game quality, perception of sales potential, customer reviews and relationships with celebrities and other licensors of brands and other content. For celebrities, brands and other content licensors, we compete based on royalty and other economic terms, historical financial performance of celebrity and other third-party licensed brand and property games, perceptions of development quality, porting abilities, speed of execution, distribution breadth and relationships with storefront owners. We also compete for experienced and talented employees, which competition we expect to encounter as we execute on our strategy to hire creative leaders that have proven track record of success in 2017.\nWe compete with a continually increasing number of companies, including Activision (the parent company of King Digital Entertainment), DeNA, Disney, Electronic Arts (EA Mobile), Gameloft, Gamevil, GREE, GungHo Online Entertainment, Netmarble, Nexon, Warner Brothers, and Zynga and many well-funded private companies, including DoubleDown, Jam City, Kabam, Machine Zone, Miniclip, Niantic, Pocket Gems, Rovio, Scopely, Storm 8/Team Lava, and Supercell. In addition, we face competition from online game developers and distributors who are primarily focused\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\non specific international markets. We could also face increased competition if those companies choose to compete more directly in the United States or the other markets that are significant to us or if large companies with significant online presences such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft or Yahoo, choose to enter or expand in the games space or develop competing games. We also compete for downloads and time spent on mobile devices with companies that develop popular social media and messaging applications, such as Facebook (with its Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp and other applications), Pinterest, Reddit, Snapchat, Twitter, Vevo and YouTube, companies that develop streaming music, movie and television applications, such as Pandora, Spotify, Tidal, HBO Go, Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu, and with companies that create non-gaming related software applications for celebrities.\nIn addition, given the open nature of the development and distribution for smartphones and tablets and the relatively low barriers to entry, we also compete or will compete with a vast number of small companies and individuals who are able to create and launch games and other content for these devices using relatively limited resources and with relatively limited start-up time or expertise. As an example of the competition that we face, it has been estimated that more than 3.0 million applications, including more than 750,000 active games, were available on Apple\u2019s U.S. App Store as of February 28, 2017. The proliferation of titles in these open developer channels makes it difficult for us to differentiate ourselves from other developers and to compete for players without substantially increasing our marketing expenses and development costs.\nSome of our competitors and our potential competitors have one or more advantages over us, either globally or in particular geographic markets, which include:\n\u00b7\nsignificantly greater financial resources;\n\u00b7\ngreater experience with free-to-play games, building and maintaining platform or evergreen titles, and building social and community features into mobile games, as well as more effective game monetization;\n\u00b7\nstronger brand and consumer recognition regionally or worldwide;\n\u00b7\nthe capacity to leverage their marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of mobile and non-mobile products;\n\u00b7\nlarger installed user bases from their existing mobile games;\n\u00b7\nlarger installed user bases from related platforms, such as console gaming or social networking websites, to which they can market and sell mobile games;\n\u00b7\nmore substantial intellectual property of their own from which they can develop games without having to pay royalties;\n\u00b7\nlower labor and development costs and better overall economies of scale;\n\u00b7\ngreater platform-specific focus, experience and expertise;\n\u00b7\nbroader global distribution and presence; and\n\u00b7\ngreater talent, both in overall headcount and in terms of experience in creating successful titles.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively or we are not as successful as our competitors in our target markets, our sales could decline, our margins could decline and we could lose market share, any of which would materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur players may decide to select competing forms of entertainment instead of playing our games.\nWe also face competition for the leisure time, attention and discretionary spending of our players. Other forms of leisure time activities, such as social media and messaging applications, personal computer and console games, television, movies, sports, and the Internet, are generally much larger and more well-established options for consumers. In addition, competition for the attention of players on their mobile devices is intense, as the number of apps on mobile devices is increasing dramatically. In particular, non-gaming applications for mobile devices, such as social media and messaging, music, movie and television streaming, and dating applications, have become increasingly popular, making it more difficult for mobile games to generate the same level of consumer interest and number of downloads as in prior periods. In addition, celebrities like Kim Kardashian West, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner have launched their own personal media applications, and those applications, or similar applications launched by other of our celebrity partners could compete with our titles that feature such celebrities for the time, attention and spending of our players. If our players do not find our games to be compelling or if other leisure time activities are perceived by our players to offer greater variety, affordability, interactivity and overall enjoyment, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nSecuring license agreements to develop, publish and market games based on or significantly incorporating celebrities, third-party licensed brands, properties, and other content typically requires that we make minimum guaranteed royalty and other payments to such licensors, and to the extent such payments become impaired, our operating results would be harmed.\nIn connection with partnerships with celebrities and other licensors of third-party brands, properties and content, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant minimum guaranteed royalty and other payments. As of December 31, 2016 we have short-term and long-term prepaid royalty balances totaling $43.8 million. As a result, we may incur increased levels of impairments on such payments if our forecasts for these games are lower than we anticipated at the time we entered into the agreements. For example, in 2016, we impaired $14.5 million related to prepaid royalty commitments and license fees paid to an affiliate of Tencent in connection with our Rival Fire title and $20.2 million related to contractual minimum guaranteed royalty payments made to certain of our celebrity licensors and other prepaid royalties. We expect that most, and potentially all, of the games we release in 2017 will be based on or otherwise incorporate celebrities and other third-party licensed brands, properties and other content as opposed to our original intellectual property games where we do not incur licensing fees and expenses. As a result, we may be required to take impairments in future periods if the games we are developing that have significant contractual minimum guarantee commitments associated with them are not successful.\nIf we do not successfully establish and maintain awareness of our brand and games, if we fail to develop high-quality, engaging games that are differentiated from our prior games, if we incur excessive expenses promoting and maintaining our brand or our games or if our games contain defects or objectionable content, our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe believe that establishing and maintaining our brand is critical to establishing a direct relationship with players who purchase our products from direct-to-consumer channels and to maintaining our existing relationships with distributors and content licensors, as well as potentially developing new such relationships. Increasing awareness of our brand and recognition of our games is particularly important in connection with our strategic focus of developing games based on our own intellectual property, games based on our celebrity partners and our other games that incorporate third party brands and properties. Our ability to promote the Glu brand and increase recognition of our games depends on our ability to develop high-quality, engaging games, including integrating the level of social and community features appropriate for a game\u2019s target audience and partnering with celebrities and brands with fan bases that can support successful mobile games. If consumers, digital storefront owners and branded content owners do not perceive our existing games as high-quality or if we introduce new games that are not favorably received by them, then we may not succeed in building brand recognition and brand loyalty in the marketplace. In addition, globalizing and extending our brand and recognition of our games is costly and involves extensive management time to execute successfully. Although we make significant sales and marketing expenditures in connection with the launch of our games, these efforts may not succeed in increasing awareness of our brand or the new games. If we fail to increase and maintain brand awareness and consumer recognition of our games, our potential revenue could be limited, our costs could increase and our\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nbusiness, operating results and financial condition could suffer.\nIn addition, if a game contains objectionable content, we could experience damage to our reputation and brand. Our games may contain violence or other content that some consumers may find objectionable. For example, Apple has assigned each of our shooter games a 17-and-older rating due to its violence. In addition, Google required us to submit two versions of our Blood & Glory and Contract Killer: Zombies games, one of which did not depict blood. Despite these ratings and precautions, consumers may be offended by some of our game content and children to whom these games are not targeted may choose to play them without parental permission nonetheless. In addition, our employees or employees of outside developers could include hidden features in our games without our knowledge, which might contain profanity, graphic violence, sexually explicit or otherwise objectionable material. If consumers believe that a game we published contains objectionable content, it could harm our brand, consumers could refuse to download it or demand a refund for any in-app purchases, and could pressure the digital storefront operators to no longer allow us to publish the game on their platforms. Similarly, if any of our games are introduced with defects or have playability issues, we may receive negative user reviews and our brand may be damaged. For example, our Racing Rivals title experienced playability and user interface issues after the release of an update in the fourth quarter of 2016 that introduced new graphics, which particularly affected users of some Android devices and harmed monetization of the game. These issues could be exacerbated if our customer service department does not timely and adequately address issues that our players have encountered with our games.\nWe have depended on a small number of games for a significant portion of our revenue in recent fiscal periods. If these games do not succeed or we do not release highly successful new games, our revenue would decline.\nIn the mobile gaming industry, new games are frequently introduced, but a relatively small number of games account for a significant portion of industry sales. Similarly, a significant portion of our revenue comes from a limited number of games, although the games in that group have shifted over time. Our top four titles for 2016, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, Cooking Dash 2016, Tap Sports Baseball 2016, and Racing Rivals, each accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue in 2016 and collectively generated approximately 56.8% of our revenue during the period, while our top five titles for 2015, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, Racing Rivals, Deer Hunter 2014, Contract Killer: Sniper and Cooking Dash 2016, each accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue in 2016 and collectively generated approximately 71.6% of our revenue during the period; no other game generated more than 10% of our revenue during the respective periods. While we expect that Covet Fashion and Design Home, titles we acquired through our acquisition of Crowdstar, will be significant revenue contributors during 2017 and help us broaden our product portfolio, we believe our revenue will still be highly dependent on a small number of titles. In particular, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, which was launched in June 2014, has accounted for a significant portion of our revenue, having generated 17.8% and 30.7% of our revenue in 2016 and 2015, respectively; it was our largest revenue title in each of 2016, 2015 and 2014. We expect our dependency on a small number of games for a majority of our revenue will continue for the foreseeable future as we implement measures to make our successful games into platforms or evergreen titles and plan to release fewer titles in 2017 than we have in past years. Our evergreen titles strategy is one where we hope to reduce period over period declines in revenue from our existing successful titles and position ourselves to convert these into platforms that grow revenue on a year over year basis. However, we have limited experience or success with this strategy and may not succeed in implementing or executing on it, which could cause our revenue to decline in 2017. In addition, revenue from Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, one of our existing evergreen titles, is in part tied to the continued popularity of Kim Kardashian West and her marketing efforts through social media and other channels, and we have little to no control over these matters and they are hard for us to predict. Accordingly, we must continue to launch new games that generate significant revenue to continue to grow revenue in the future, which we have sometimes failed to do. For example, the Katy Perry Pop title we launched in the fourth quarter of 2015, our Britney Spears: American Dream title that we launched in May 2016 and our Nicki Minaj: The Empire title that we launched in December 2016 all failed to generate meaningful revenue, and revenue from our Kendall & Kylie title declined significantly from its peak level following global launch in February 2016. We may similarly fail to generate significant revenue from the title featuring Taylor Swift that we will be releasing in 2017. In addition, sequels to some of our most successful game franchises have failed to download and monetize at the levels of predecessor versions, and we have experienced disappointing results from several games based on film franchises, including our James Bond: World of Espionage game. Failure to differentiate, innovate and otherwise improve our games and game franchises would lead to revenue declines.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf our title featuring Taylor Swift does not succeed, our operating results and financial condition could be harmed and investors may question the viability of our celebrity product strategy.\nWe intend to launch a title featuring Taylor Swift in 2017, and have entered into agreements with additional celebrities to create games featuring their intellectual property. We face a number of risks in our ability to successfully develop and monetize games featuring celebrities, have encountered difficulties in doing so with respect to the titles we released in 2016 featuring celebrities and may be unable to fully recoup minimum guaranteed royalty payments made to such celebrities through the generation of ongoing revenue from our titles. For example, although Kim Kardashian: Hollywood has been by far the most successful mobile game featuring a celebrity and our Kendall & Kylie game achieved initial success following its worldwide launch in February 2016, we and other game developers have failed to achieve success with games featuring other celebrities, including our Katy Perry Pop, Britney Spears: American Dream and Nicki Minaj: The Empire titles. Further, we have been unable to sustain the initial success experienced by our Kendall & Kylie game while both Britney Spears: American Dream and Nicki Minaj: The Empire failed to attract a significant user base and downloads, resulting in lower monetization. Our failure to generate significant revenue from our celebrity titles since Kim Kardashian: Hollywood has resulted in us impairing a significant amount related to certain contractual minimum guarantee payments made to certain of our celebrity licensors. Accordingly, it is possible that there is something unique about Kim Kardashian West, the nature of her celebrity and the demographics and purchasing power of her fan base that has led to the continued and sustained success of Kim Kardashian: Hollywood that will not be replicable in games featuring other celebrities, particularly musicians. It is possible that our title featuring Taylor Swift may not be commercially successful in the same manner as our prior games featuring a female musician, Katy Perry Pop, Britney Spears: American Dream and Nicki Minaj: The Empire. In addition, some of the celebrities with whom we have partnered may have similar fan bases, and any actual overlap in the audiences for our different titles featuring celebrities could result in market saturation or cannibalization of revenue of our own titles. We must also differentiate our forthcoming titles in order to ensure our offerings remain fresh and engaging and to satisfy our celebrity partners. However, differentiating our various titles that feature celebrities could lead to increased development costs and potential product launch delays and may result in titles that do not monetize as well as Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. If our new titles that feature celebrities, including our upcoming Taylor Swift title, are not successful, our business and operating results would suffer and investors may question the viability of our celebrity product strategy.\nWe rely on a combination of our own servers and technology and third party infrastructure to operate our games. If we experience any system or network failures, unexpected technical problems, cyber attacks or any other interruption to our games, it could reduce our sales, increase costs, or result in a loss of revenue or loss of end users of our games.\nWe rely on digital storefronts and other third-party networks to deliver games to our players and on their or other third parties\u2019 billing systems to track and account for our game downloads. We also rely on our own servers and third-party infrastructure to operate our connected games, and we expect that our reliance on such third-party infrastructure and our technology platform will increase as we continue to add additional social features and functionality into our games. In particular, a significant portion of our game traffic is hosted by Amazon Web Services, which service provides server redundancy and uses multiple locations on various distinct power grids. Amazon may terminate its agreement with us upon 30 days\u2019 notice. In addition, Amazon has experienced brief power outages on occasion during the past several years that have affected the availability of certain of our games during such outages. While none of these events adversely impacted our business, a similar outage of a longer duration could. In addition, the operation of our online-only games depends on the continued functionality of our technology platform. As a result, we could experience unexpected technical problems with regard to the operation of our online-only games, particularly if the number of concurrent users playing our games is significantly more than we anticipate. Any technical problem with, cyber attack on, or loss of access to these third parties\u2019 or our systems, servers or other technologies, including our technology platform, could result in the inability of end users to download or play our games, cause interruption to gameplay, prevent the completion of billing for a game or result in the loss of users\u2019 virtual currency or other in-app purchases, interfere with access to some aspects of our games or result in the theft of end-user personal information. For example, in July 2014, users could not play our Kim Kardashian: Hollywood game for about six hours due to a problem with one of our servers, and on five occasions during the last two years, we experienced similar outages with respect to our Racing Rivals game. Additionally, in October 2016 we experienced a short outage affecting our Tap Sports Baseball 2016 game. In addition, at launch in September 2015, our Eternity Warriors 4 title experienced intermittent server issues that left the game temporarily inoperable. In the first\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nquarter of 2016 we experienced technical issues with our Kendall & Kylie title that caused users to lose their game play data, including accumulated virtual currency and achieved levels. If users are unable to access and play our games for any period of time, if virtual assets are lost, or if users do not receive their purchased virtual currency, we may receive negative publicity and game ratings, we may lose players of our games, we may be required to issue refunds, and we may become subject to regulatory investigation or class action litigation, any of which would negatively affect our business. Any of these problems could require us to incur substantial repair costs, distract management from operating our business and result in a loss of revenue.\nCyber attacks, security breaches, and computer viruses could harm our business, reputation, brand and operating results.\nCyber attacks, security breaches, and computer viruses have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future. We store sensitive information, including personal information about our employees. In addition, our games involve the storage and transmission of players\u2019 personal information in our facilities and on our equipment, networks and corporate systems run by us or managed by third-parties including Apple, Google, and Facebook. Security breaches of our systems or the systems of third-parties on which we rely could expose us to litigation, remediation costs, increased costs for security measures, loss of revenue, damage to our reputation and potential liability. Our player data, corporate systems, third-party systems and security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, a combination of these, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data, our employees\u2019 data, our players\u2019 data or our advertisers\u2019 data. In addition, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees to disclose information in order to gain access to our data, our employees\u2019 data, our players\u2019 data or our advertisers\u2019 data. We were the victim of a cyber attack in early November 2014, when an animal rights group took down our main website and user forums, and in January 2016 another cyber attack caused us to take down our user forums for nearly a week. In May 2016, one of our employees fell victim to a spear phishing attack in which the employee uploaded sensitive employee information to a third party website. In October 2013, we were also the victim of a \u201cCryptoLocker\u201d ransomware attack that temporarily prevented our access to sensitive company files. Although these incidents did not result in a material loss of revenue, any future incidents, particularly of longer duration, could damage our brand and reputation and result in a material loss of revenue. Maintaining an international presence in China and elsewhere, we may place ourselves at increased risk of cyber attacks, such as the denial of service attacks that affected Sony Pictures in the fourth quarter of 2014. The low cost, relative ease and proliferation of internet enabled devices may also place us at increased risk of cyber attacks and, specifically, denial of service attacks, such as the denial of service attacks that affected Dyn in October 2016. In addition, as highlighted by reports that ISIS terrorists may have used Sony\u2019s PlayStation 4 network to plan attacks, the chat and other social features in our games could potentially be used by terrorist organizations or other criminals to communicate or for other nefarious purposes, which could severely damage our brand and reputation. If an actual or perceived security breach occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose players and advertisers, and we could suffer significant legal and financial harm due to such events or in connection with remediation efforts and costs, investigation costs or penalties, litigation, regulatory and enforcement actions, changed security and system protection measures. Any of these actions could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of investigating, remediating, eliminating and putting in place additional information technology tools and devices designed to prevent actual or perceived security breaches, as well as the costs to comply with any notification obligations resulting from such a breach, could have a significant impact on our financial and operating results.\nIf we fail to maintain and enhance our capabilities for porting games to a broad array of mobile devices, particularly those running the Android operating system, our revenue and financial results could suffer.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from the sale of virtual goods within our games for smartphones and tablets that run Apple\u2019s iOS or Google\u2019s Android operating system. Unlike the Apple ecosystem in which Apple controls both the device (iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad) and the storefront (Apple\u2019s App Store), the Android ecosystem is highly fragmented since a large number of OEMs manufacture and sell Android-based devices that run a variety of versions of the Android operating system, and there are many Android-based storefronts in addition to the Google Play Store. For us to sell our games to the widest possible audience of Android users, we must port our games to a significant portion of the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nmore than 1,000 Android-based devices that are commercially available, many of which have different technical requirements. Since the number of Android-based smartphones and tablets shipped worldwide is growing significantly, with more than one billion Android based devices sold worldwide in 2014, it is important that we maintain and enhance our porting capabilities, which could require us to invest considerable resources in this area. These additional costs could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we must continue to increase the efficiency of our porting processes or it may take us longer to port games to an equivalent number of devices, which would negatively impact our margins. If we fail to maintain or enhance our porting capabilities, our revenue and financial results could suffer. For example, the technical issues we have experienced with our Kendall & Kylie title in the first quarter of 2016 and Racing Rivals title in the fourth quarter of 2016 appear to be more pronounced on certain Android devices, and this may have harmed the revenue we are able to generate from users on Android devices.\nWe use a game development engine licensed from Unity Technologies to create many of our games. If we experience any prolonged technical issues with this engine or if we lose access to this engine for any reason, it could delay our game development efforts and cause our financial results to fall below expectations for a quarterly or annual period, which would likely cause our stock price to decline.\nWe use a game development engine licensed from Unity Technologies to create many of our games, and we expect to continue to use this engine for the foreseeable future. Because we do not own this engine, we do not control its operation or maintenance nor do we control how the engine is updated or upgraded. As a result, any prolonged technical issues with this engine might not be resolved quickly, despite the fact that we have contractual service level commitments from Unity. In addition, to the extent that we require any functionality that is not offered by Unity, as was the case when Apple initially announced its 64-bit requirement, we are dependent on Unity to update or upgrade its engine to offer such functionality. Furthermore, although Unity cannot terminate our agreement absent an uncured material breach of the agreement by us, we could lose access to this engine under certain circumstances, such as a natural disaster that impacts Unity or a bankruptcy event. If we experience any prolonged issues with the operation of the Unity game development engine, if the Unity game development engine does not offer the functionality we require or if we lose access to this engine for any reason, it could delay our game development efforts and cause us to not meet revenue expectations for a quarterly or annual period, which would likely cause our stock price to decline. For example, in the first quarter of 2016, we were unable to implement a significant update to our Racing Rivals title due to programming bugs in the Unity game development engine, which update we believe could have helped to increase revenue for that title during the quarter. Further, if one of our competitors acquired Unity, the acquiring company would be less likely to renew our agreement, which expires in October 2017, which could impact our game development efforts in the future, particularly with respect to sequels to games that were created on the Unity engine.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from advertisements and offers that are incorporated into our free-to-play games through relationships with third parties. If we lose the ability to provide these advertisements and offers for any reason, or if any events occur that negatively impact the revenue we receive from these sources, it would negatively impact our operating results.\nWe derive revenue from our free-to-play games through in-app purchases, advertisements and offers. We incorporate advertisements and offers into our games by implementing third parties\u2019 software development kits. We rely on these third parties to provide us with a sufficient inventory of advertisements and offers to meet the demand of our user base. If we exhaust the available inventory of these third parties, it will negatively impact our revenue. If our relationship with any of these third parties terminates for any reason, or if the commercial terms of our relationships do not continue to be renewed on favorable terms, we would need to locate and implement other third party solutions, which could negatively impact our revenue, at least in the short term. Furthermore, the revenue that we derive from advertisements and offers is subject to seasonality, as companies\u2019 advertising budgets are generally highest during the fourth quarter and decline significantly in the first quarter of the following year, which negatively impacts our revenue in the first quarter (and conversely significantly increases our marketing expenses in the fourth quarter).\nIn addition, the actions of the storefront operators can also negatively impact the revenue that we generate from advertisements and offers. For example, in the second quarter of 2011, Apple began prohibiting virtual currency-incented advertising offers in games that directed users to download other applications from the Apple App Store in order to\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncomplete the offer. These offers accounted for approximately one-third of our revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2011, and our inability to use such offers has negatively impacted our revenue. In addition, during the second quarter of 2014, there were reports that Apple was considering prohibiting certain types of virtual currency-incented video advertising in games that promoted other applications available on the Apple App Store. These incented video advertisements generate a meaningful percentage of our overall revenue, and any prohibition of these advertisements would have had a negative impact on our revenue. Any similar changes in the future that impact our revenue that we generate from advertisements and offers could materially harm our business.\nWe may not, or may be unable to, renew our existing celebrity, brand and other content licenses when they expire and may not choose to obtain additional licenses or be able to obtain new licenses on favorable terms, which could negatively impact our revenue if we fail to replace such revenue with revenue from games based on our own intellectual property.\nAlthough we generated 93.3% of our revenue from games based on our own intellectual property during 2013, that percentage declined to 62.7% in 2014, 42.1% in 2015 and 39.7% in 2016, largely due to the majority of our revenue being generated from games that are based on or substantially incorporate third-party intellectual property, such as Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, Kendall & Kylie, Racing Rivals, the Tap Sports Baseball franchise and Gordon Ramsay DASH. We expect our revenue derived from games based on or substantially incorporating third-party intellectual property to increase further in 2017, as we expect to continue to derive significant revenue from Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, Racing Rivals, Tap Sports Baseball 2016, and Gordon Ramsay DASH, and the majority, or potentially all of the titles, we release in 2017 will feature or otherwise leverage celebrities or other third-party licensed brands, properties or other content, including our Taylor Swift title and MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2017 which will include licensed content from the MLB in addition to the MLBPA and MLBPAA. Certain of our licenses expire at various times during the next several years, and we may be unable to renew these licenses on terms favorable to us or at all, and we may have difficulties obtaining licenses from new celebrities on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, these licensors could decide to license to our competitors or develop and publish their own mobile games, competing with us in the marketplace. We also license certain brands and their assets for our Covet Fashion and Design Home titles without the provision of a license fee or royalty. These licensors could decide to no longer license their assets under the current terms, and to instead charge a one-time payment, ongoing royalty or both, which may adversely affect the profitability of these titles. Failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses or to obtain additional licenses would prevent us from continuing to offer our current licensed games and introducing new mobile games based on such licensed content, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe publish games developed by third parties, which exposes us to a number of potential operational and legal risks.\nPublishing games developed by third parties exposes us to a number of potential operational and legal risks. For example, we may be required to provide third party developers with upfront license fees or non-recoupable minimum guaranteed royalties in order to obtain the rights to publish their games, and we may incur significant costs marketing these games after they have been commercially launched. For example, we agreed to significant license fee and minimum guaranteed royalty payments to an affiliate of Tencent to license and publish Tencent\u2019s WeFire game in the United States and international markets outside of Asia under the title Rival Fire. Due to Rival Fire\u2019s poor performance in terms of downloads and monetization since its launch in July 2016, we impaired $14.5 million in 2016 related to these payments. Other third-party games that we license and publish may not be commercially successful, particularly if they fail to appeal to Western audiences, and may not generate the amount of revenue necessary for us to fully recoup minimum guaranteed royalty and license fee payments. We and other mobile gaming companies have failed in the past to achieve commercial success in bringing successful games developed and launched in Asia to Western markets, including with respect to our efforts to publish and monetize Rival Fire. In addition, if any of the games created by third party developers with which we work infringe intellectual property owned by others, or otherwise violate any third party\u2019s rights or any applicable laws and regulations, such as laws with respect to data collection and privacy, we would be exposed to potential legal risks by publishing these games.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur business and growth may suffer if we are unable to hire and retain key personnel.\nOur future success will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to attract, retain and motivate our key personnel, namely our management team, creative leaders and experienced game development personnel. In particular, we experienced a change in our management team in November 2016 which included the appointment of Nick Earl as our President and Chief Executive Officer and Niccolo de Masi as our Executive Chairman. Each of Mr. Earl and Mr. de Masi is critical to our vision, strategic direction, products and technology and the continued retention of the remaining senior management team is important to our continued development. In addition, to grow our business, execute on our business strategy and replace departing employees, we must identify, hire and retain qualified personnel, particularly creative leaders and additional game development teams to support our new product launches and monetization, live operations, server technology, user experience and product management personnel to support our platform and evergreen games. Attracting and retaining proven creative leaders is difficult in a competitive hiring market. We intend to hire two to four additional creative leaders during the remainder of 2017, and we may not be able to attract these creative leaders or retain our existing creative leaders. The gaming and technology industries are also traditionally male dominated, so it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain talented female personnel who may be needed to help us optimize our games that are targeted to a more female-focused audience, including our games in the fashion and celebrity, food and home genres. Recent stock price declines, the lack of success of many of our product launches in 2016 and recent headcount reductions may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain top talent. Competition for qualified management, game development and other staff is intense, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area where we are headquartered. In addition, attracting and retaining qualified personnel may be particularly difficult for us if our stock price continues to decline or remains at current levels, since individuals may elect to seek employment with other companies that they believe have better long-term prospects or that present better opportunities for earning equity-based compensation. Competitors have in the past and may in the future attempt to recruit our employees, and our management and key employees are not bound by agreements that could prevent them from terminating their employment at any time. As we continue to develop expertise in free-to-play mobile gaming and building and maintaining platform and evergreen titles, our competitors may increasingly seek to recruit our employees, particularly from our development studios. In addition, we do not maintain a key-person life insurance policy on any of our officers. Our business and growth may suffer if we are unable to hire and retain key personnel.\nAny restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives that we undertake may not deliver the results we expect, and these actions may adversely affect our business.\nDuring the last several years we have implemented certain restructuring actions and cost reduction initiatives to streamline operations and improve cost efficiencies. Our most recent restructurings included reductions in personnel in Bellevue, Washington, San Francisco, California and Long Beach, California. We plan to continue to manage costs to better and more efficiently manage our business. This most recent restructuring plan and other such efforts could result in disruptions to our operations and adversely affect our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that the cost reduction and streamlining initiatives will be as successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect or that additional costs will not offset any such reductions or streamlining. If our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses, our operating results will suffer.\nWe may not realize the benefits expected through our strategic relationship with Tencent and other aspects of the relationship could have adverse effects on our business.\nIn April 2015, we entered into a strategic relationship with Tencent, a leading Internet company in China and arguably the world\u2019s largest gaming company. Tencent, through a controlled affiliate, agreed to invest $126.0 million in exchange for approximately 16.3% of our total outstanding common stock on a post-transaction basis. In November 2015, we entered into an agreement with an affiliate of Tencent to license and publish its game, WeFire, in the United States and international markets outside of Asia under the name Rival Fire, which we launched in July 2016. In light of the poor performance of the title in terms of monetization and downloads, and the related contractual prepaid royalty commitments and license fees under our agreement with the affiliate of Tencent, we impaired $14.5 million in the third quarter of 2016. In addition, we may not succeed in entering into any other agreements or operating partnerships with Tencent in the future. Even if we do enter into additional operational partnerships, it could take months to years to fully\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrealize the benefits of such partnerships and, to the extent such agreements involve publishing our games in China, some of our platform partners in China and other parts of Asia may view such a partnership negatively, and in fact, some partners in China may already view the fact that Tencent is a significant investor in us negatively, and we may find it more difficult to obtain featuring of our games from such partners in China going forward.\nTencent, through its controlled affiliates, held approximately 20.9% of the aggregate voting power of our common stock as of February 28, 2017, and could acquire up to 25.0% of the voting power through open-market purchases of our common stock. While Tencent has agreed to cause these shares to be voted with the majority recommendation of the independent members of our board of directors on most matters, Tencent could have considerable influence over matters such as approving a potential acquisition of us. Tencent was also granted the right to designate a member of our board of directors, initially appointing Tencent Senior Vice President, Steven Ma, and in January 2017 appointing Ben Feder, Tencent\u2019s President of International Partnerships (North America), as Mr. Ma\u2019s replacement on Glu board of directors. Mr. Feder or any future Tencent designee could have an actual or apparent conflict of interest in such matters. Tencent\u2019s investment in and position with us could also discourage others from pursuing any potential acquisition of us, which could have the effect of depriving the holders of our common stock of the opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over the prevailing market price.\nOur reported financial results could be adversely affected by changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves.\nOur reported financial results are impacted by the accounting policies promulgated by the SEC and accounting standards bodies and the methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies. The frequency of accounting policy changes may accelerate, including conversion to unified international accounting standards. Policies affecting revenue recognition have affected, and could further significantly affect, the way we account for revenue. For example, the accounting for revenue derived from smartphone platforms and free-to-play games, particularly with regard to revenue generated from online digital storefronts, is still evolving and, in some cases, uncertain. In particular, we were required to file an amendment to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2013 to restate or revise the financial statements contained in those reports (including for the year ended December 31, 2011) because we did not correctly apply the applicable revenue recognition accounting guidance relating to our smartphone revenue. While we believe that we are now correctly accounting for our smartphone revenue, this is an area that continues to involve significant discussion among accounting professionals and which is not completely settled. It is possible that the relative application, interpretation and weighting of the factors that relate to whether we should be considered the principal in the sales transaction of games sold through digital storefronts may evolve, and we may in the future conclude that our new accounting policy for smartphone revenue, as reflected in the restated financial statements, is incorrect, which could result in another restatement of affected financial statements. In addition, we currently defer revenue related to virtual goods and currency over the average playing period of paying users, which approximates the estimated weighted average useful life of the transaction. While we believe our estimates are reasonable based on available game player information, we may revise such estimates in the future as our games\u2019 operation periods change. Any adjustments arising from changes in the estimates of the lives of these virtual items would be applied to the current quarter and prospectively on the basis that such changes are caused by new information indicating a change in the game player behavior patterns of our paying users. Any changes in our estimates of useful lives of these virtual items may result in our revenue being recognized on a basis different from prior periods\u2019 and may cause our operating results to fluctuate. As we enhance, expand and diversify our business and product offerings, the application of existing or future financial accounting standards, particularly those relating to the way we account for our smartphone revenue, could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to produce reliable financial statements. In connection with the restatement of our financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2013,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, reassessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. Based on this reassessment using the guidelines established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 1992, management had concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 because of a material weakness related to the application of revenue accounting guidance to our smartphone revenue for sales through digital storefronts. This control deficiency resulted in the misstatement of our revenue and cost of revenue, including gross margin percentages, and the related balance sheet accounts and financial disclosures for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012 (and the restatement of unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, June 30, and September 30 for such years). Although we have remediated this material weakness, if we are otherwise unable to maintain adequate internal controls for financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal controls as required pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, it could result in another material misstatement of our financial statements that would require a restatement, investor confidence in the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reports may be impacted or the market price of our common stock could be negatively impacted.\nConversion of key internal systems and processes, particularly our ERP system, and problems with the design or implementation of these systems and processes could interfere with, and therefore harm, our business and operations.\nWe have underway a multi-phase project to convert certain key internal systems and processes, including our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system to a cloud based system. In August 2016 we implemented major changes to our ERP system, which activities we expect to continue into 2017. In connection with the transition to our new ERP system in the third quarter of 2016, we shutdown certain of our legacy ERP systems in the third quarter of 2016, which affected certain of our processes in the second half of 2016 and may impact our processes in 2017. While we have transitioned to our new ERP system, we may need to resolve issues that arise in connection with this transition. We have invested, and will continue to invest, significant capital and human resources in the design and implementation of these systems and processes. Any problems, disruptions, delays or other issues in the design and implementation of the new systems or processes, particularly any that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to process payments, record and transfer information in a timely and accurate manner, recognize revenue, file SEC reports in a timely manner, or otherwise run our business. Even if we encounter these adverse effects, as noted above, the design and implementation of these new systems and processes may be much more costly than we anticipated and in the event of lengthy project delays, we may experience issues with retention of the implementation team. If we are unable to successfully design and implement these new systems and processes as planned, or if the implementation of these systems and processes is more lengthy or costly than anticipated, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur business will suffer if our acquisition and strategic investment activities are unsuccessful or disrupt our ongoing business, which may involve increased expenses and may present risks not contemplated at the time of the transactions.\nWe have acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, companies, products and technologies that complement our strategic direction. Acquisitions and investments involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and a shift of focus from operating the business to issues related to negotiation of acquisition or investment terms, integration and administration;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully integrate acquired technologies and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures;\n\u00b7\npotential employee morale and retention issues resulting from any reductions in compensation, or changes in management, reporting relationships, or future prospects;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\npotential product development delays resulting from any changes and disruptions that may follow the acquisition;\n\u00b7\nsignificant competition from other acquirors and investors as the gaming industry consolidates and challenges in offering attractive consideration given the volatility of our stock price and potential difficulties in obtaining alternative financing;\n\u00b7\nchallenges retaining the key employees, customers and other business partners of the acquired or investee business;\n\u00b7\nour ability to realize synergies expected to result from an acquisition or strategic investment;\n\u00b7\nan impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets or investments in future periods would result in a charge to earnings in the period in which the write-down occurs, such as the case with each of the charges we took in the second and third quarters of 2016 for our investments in Plain Vanilla;\n\u00b7\nthe internal control environment of an acquired or investee entity may not be consistent with our standards and may require significant time and resources to improve;\n\u00b7\nin the case of foreign acquisitions or strategic investments, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u00b7\nliability for activities of the acquired or investee companies before the acquisition or investment, including violations of laws, rules and regulations, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, intellectual property and other litigation claims or disputes, accounting standards and other known and unknown liabilities;\n\u00b7\nharm to our brand and reputation; and\n\u00b7\nharm to our existing business relationships with business partners and advertisers as a result of the acquisition.\nIn particular, we acquired Crowdstar in the fourth quarter of 2016 in a multi-step transaction that did not involve the cooperation of Crowdstar\u2019s management, where the former Chief Executive Officer of Crowdstar did not continue with the company post-acquisition and where we did not receive customary representations, warranties or indemnities from the acquired company. While the integration of Crowdstar into our company has to date proceeded relatively smoothly and Crowdstar\u2019s top titles, Covet Fashion and Design Home, are generating significant revenue, we still face risks and uncertainties in connection with completing this integration, including the risk of retaining key employees, the loss of whom could affect revenue derived from Covet Fashion and Design Home.\nIn addition, if we issue equity securities as consideration in an acquisition or strategic investment, as we did for our acquisitions of Griptonite, Inc., Blammo Games Inc., GameSpy Industries, Inc., PlayFirst, Inc. and Cie Games, Inc., our current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership and earnings per share would be diluted. We may also need to raise additional capital in the event we use a significant amount of cash as consideration in an acquisition. Because acquisitions and strategic investments are inherently risky, our transactions may not be successful and may, in some cases, harm our operating results or financial condition.\nChanges in foreign exchange rates and limitations on the convertibility of foreign currencies could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe currently transact business in more than 100 countries and in dozens of different currencies, with Pounds Sterling, Euros and Chinese Renminbi being the primary international currencies in which we transact business.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nConducting business in currencies other than U.S. Dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could have a negative impact on our reported operating results. We experienced significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates in 2015 and 2016, and expect to experience continued significant fluctuations in the future. We incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our non-U.S. locations in the local currency, and an increasing percentage of our international revenue is from customers who pay us in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and those other currencies could result in the U.S. Dollar equivalent of these expenses being higher and/or the U.S. Dollar equivalent of the foreign-denominated revenue being lower than would be the case if exchange rates were stable. This could negatively impact our operating results. Conversely, economic issues in Russia led to a significant devaluation of the Ruble compared to the U.S. Dollar through the second quarter of 2016. While the Ruble has recovered somewhat since historic lows in the second quarter of 2016, it remains significantly devalued, which has reduced the effective salaries of our employees in our Moscow studio. As a result, we may be at risk of losing key employees to competitors who are willing to offer higher effective wages. To date, we have not engaged in exchange rate hedging activities, and we do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future.\nWe face additional risk if a currency is not freely or actively traded. Some currencies, such as the Chinese Renminbi in which our Chinese operations principally transact business, are subject to limitations on conversion into other currencies, which can limit our ability to react to rapid foreign currency devaluations and to repatriate funds to the United States should we require additional working capital.\nWe face added business, political, regulatory, operational, financial and economic risks as a result of our international operations and distribution, any of which could increase our costs and adversely affect our operating results.\nInternational sales represented approximately 25.7%, 31.3% and 40.6% of our revenue during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. To target international markets, we develop games that are customized for consumers in those markets. We have international offices located in a number of foreign countries including Canada, China, India, Japan and Russia. We expect to increase our international presence, as we intend to increase the number of our employees in our Hyderabad, India office. Risks affecting our international operations include:\n\u00b7\nour ability to develop games that appeal to the tastes and preferences of consumers in international markets;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties developing, staffing, and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;\n\u00b7\nmultiple and conflicting laws and regulations, including complications due to unexpected changes in these laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nour ability to develop, customize and localize games that appeal to the tastes and preferences of consumers in international markets;\n\u00b7\ncompetition from local game developers that have significant market share in certain foreign markets and a better understanding of local consumer preferences;\n\u00b7\npotential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting improper payments to government officials or representatives of commercial partners;\n\u00b7\nregulations that could potentially affect the content of our products and their distribution, particularly in China where multiple governmental bodies must review and approve of any gaming application before it may be published;\n\u00b7\nforeign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating income earned in countries outside the United States, particularly China;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\npotential adverse foreign tax consequences, since due to our international operations, we must pay income tax in numerous foreign jurisdictions with complex and evolving tax laws;\n\u00b7\npolitical, economic and social instability, including the ongoing hostilities in Syria and the Crimea region and, in particular, any continued economic issues in Russia, which could potentially negatively impact us given that we have a development studio in Moscow;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the export or import of technology;\n\u00b7\ntrade and tariff restrictions and variations in tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers; and\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights in certain countries.\nThese risks could harm our international operations, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In particular, we have over 100 employees located at our development studio in Moscow, Russia. Continuing economic issues in Russia, including the destabilization of the Ruble, could lead to unstable political conditions, civil unrest or other developments that could materially affect our business, including through distractions and potential hardships to our Russian employees, restrictions on our ability to fund our Russian operations, and other difficulties that could cause delays to our game launches or even the cancellation of a game release and otherwise affect our ability to update and maintain games operated by our Moscow studio.\nWe may also liquidate or cease operating some of our foreign subsidiaries in the future which may raise additional risks. For example, we are in the process of winding down and liquidating certain of our subsidiaries in China. These liquidation efforts will require us to obtain approvals from various government agencies in China, which could impose taxes and penalties upon us related to such liquidations. In addition, we may face difficulties in repatriating cash from our subsidiaries in China.\nIf we fail to deliver our games at the same time as new mobile devices are commercially introduced, our revenue may suffer.\nOur business depends, in part, on the commercial introduction of new mobile devices with enhanced features, including larger, higher resolution color screens, improved audio quality, and greater processing power, memory, battery life and storage. For example, the introduction of new and more powerful versions of Apple\u2019s iPhone and iPad and devices based on Google\u2019s Android operating system, have helped drive the growth of the mobile games market. In addition, consumers generally purchase the majority of content, such as our games, for a new device within a few months of purchasing it. We do not control the timing of these device launches. The mobile games market could also be disrupted by new technologies, such as the introduction of next generation virtual reality devices. Some manufacturers give us access to their new devices prior to commercial release. If one or more major manufacturers were to stop providing us access to new device models prior to commercial release, we might be unable to introduce games that are compatible with the new device when the device is first commercially released, and we might be unable to make compatible games for a substantial period following the device release. If we do not adequately build into our title plan the demand for games for a particular mobile device or experience game launch delays, we miss the opportunity to sell games when new mobile devices are shipped or our end users upgrade to a new mobile device, our revenue would likely decline and our business, operating results and financial condition would likely suffer.\nIf the use of smartphones and tablet devices as game platforms and the proliferation of mobile devices generally do not increase, our business could be adversely affected.\nWhile the number of people using mobile Internet-enabled devices, such as smartphones and tablet devices, has increased dramatically in the past few years, the mobile market, particularly the market for mobile games, is still emerging, and it may not grow as we anticipate. Our future success is substantially dependent upon the continued growth of use of mobile devices for games, as opposed to social media applications or other uses. The proliferation of mobile\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ndevices may not continue to develop at historical rates and consumers may not continue to use mobile Internet-enabled devices as platforms for games. We believe that historic rates of adoption and download of new applications in the United States will not continue to rise, and will instead decline, as the U.S. mobile application market enters a mature state. In addition, new and emerging technologies could make the mobile devices on which our games are currently released obsolete, requiring us to transition our business model to develop games for other next-generation platforms.\nOur business is subject to increasing governmental regulation. If we do not successfully respond to these regulations, our business may suffer.\nWe are subject to a number of domestic and foreign laws and regulations that affect our business. Not only are these laws constantly evolving, which could result in their being interpreted in ways that could harm our business, but legislation is also continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution. In the United States, for example, numerous federal and state laws have been introduced which attempt to restrict the content or distribution of games. Legislation has been adopted in several states, and proposed at the federal level, that prohibits the sale of certain games to minors. If such legislation is adopted, it could harm our business by limiting the games we are able to offer to our customers or by limiting the size of the potential market for our games. We may also be required to modify certain games or alter our marketing strategies to comply with new and possibly inconsistent regulations, which could be costly or delay the release of our games. For example, the United Kingdom\u2019s Office of Fair Trading issued new principles in January 2014 relating to in-app purchases in free-to-play games that are directed towards children 16 and under, which principles became effective in April 2014. In addition, in response to a request made by the European Commission, Google no longer labels free-to-play games as free in European Union countries. Similarly, in the fourth quarter of 2014, Apple changed its label for free-to-download applications from \u201cFREE\u201d to \u201cGET\u201d in the Apple App Store. The FTC has also indicated that it intends to review issues related to in-app purchases, particularly with respect to games that are marketed primarily to minors; the FTC reached settlement agreements with Apple and Google on this subject and recently won a lawsuit against Amazon on this subject. If the FTC issues rules significantly restricting or even prohibiting in-app purchases, it would significantly impact our business strategy. In addition, two self-regulatory bodies in the United States (the Entertainment Software Rating Board) and in the European Union (Pan European Game Information (PEGI)) provide consumers with rating information on various products such as entertainment software similar to our products based on the content (for example, violence, sexually explicit content, language). Furthermore, the Chinese government has adopted measures designed to eliminate violent or obscene content in games, along with regulations that may require us to obtain approval from certain government agencies in China, including the Ministry of Culture and General Administration of Press and Publication, in order to continue to publish any of our games in China. Any one or more of these factors could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers, by limiting the size of the potential market for our products, or by requiring costly additional differentiation between products for different territories to address varying regulations.\nFurthermore, the growth and development of free-to-play gaming and the sale of virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours. We anticipate that scrutiny and regulation of our industry will increase and that we will be required to devote legal and other resources to addressing such regulation. For example, existing laws or new laws regarding the regulation of currency and banking institutions may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods. If that were to occur we may be required to seek licenses, authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators, the granting of which may depend on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight, all of which could significantly increase our operating costs. Changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the United States or elsewhere regarding these activities may dampen the growth of free-to-play gaming and impair our business.\nWe sometimes offer our players various types of sweepstakes, giveaways and promotional opportunities, and launched a version of our Frontline Commando: D-Day game utilizing the Skillz technology platform that allowed players to compete against each other in tournaments for cash prizes. We have also in the past through a partnership with Probability PLC offered a suite of Glu branded mobile slots games in the United Kingdom and might continue to explore opportunities with respect to real money gambling. We are subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and offering of such activities and games, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncould harm our business. Any court ruling or other governmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services could result in criminal or civil liability and could harm our business.\nIn addition, because our services are available worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions and others may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, including in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure.\nThe laws and regulations concerning data privacy and data security are continually evolving, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and the protection of the information that we collect regarding our users, which laws are currently in a state of flux and likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. The U.S. government, including the FTC and the Department of Commerce, is continuing to review the need for greater regulation over collecting information concerning consumer behavior on the Internet and on mobile devices. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, which will become effective in May 2018, creates new individual privacy rights and imposes worldwide obligations on companies handling personal data, which will result in a greater compliance burden for us and other companies with European users. Various U.S. state and federal regulators have also continued to expand the scope of data elements worthy of, and subject to, privacy protections, creating a multi-layered regulation regime that may be applicable to our business and will require time and resources to address. Additionally, the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act requires companies to obtain parental consent before collecting personal information from children under the age of 13. In January 2014, the FTC announced a settlement with Apple related to in-app purchases made by minors. In April 2016, the FTC was also successful in a lawsuit against Amazon, with a Federal District Court granting summary judgment in favor of the FTC, finding Amazon liable for unfairly billing consumers for unauthorized in-app purchases by minors. If we do not follow existing laws and regulations, as well as the rules of the smartphone platform operators, with respect to privacy-related matters, or if consumers raise any concerns about our privacy practices, even if unfounded, it could damage our reputation and operating results.\nAll of our games are subject to our privacy policy and our terms of service located on our corporate website. If we fail to comply with our posted privacy policy, terms of service or privacy-related laws and regulations, including with respect to the information we collect from users of our games, it could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. In addition, interpreting and applying data protection laws to the mobile gaming industry is often unclear. These laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from state to state, country to country, or region to region, and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, if we fail to adequately protect our users\u2019 privacy and data, it could result in a loss of player confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of users, which could adversely affect our business.\nIn the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as the 2002 amendment to California\u2019s Information Practices Act, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often vaguely defined and difficult to implement. Costs to comply with these laws may increase as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities. The security measures we have in place to protect our data and the personal information of our employees, customers and partners could be breached due to cyber-attacks initiated by third party hackers, employee error or malfeasance, fraudulent inducement of our employees to disclose sensitive information or otherwise. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any breach or unauthorized access could materially interfere with our operations or our ability to offer our services or result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our data, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur stock price has fluctuated and declined significantly since our initial public offering in March 2007, and may continue to fluctuate, may not rise and may decline further.\nThe trading price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is expected to continue to fluctuate in the future, as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside our control, such as changes in the operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular, such as Electronic Arts and Zynga. We also experience stock price volatility as investors monitor the performance of our games through third-party tools, such as App Annie, the Apple App Store\u2019s \u201cTop Grossing\u201d rankings and other measurements of the performance of our games.\nIn addition, The NASDAQ Global Market on which our common stock is listed has recently and in the past experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many companies, some of which appear to be unrelated or disproportionate to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Securities class action litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIf we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and improperly use our intellectual property and our business and operating results may be harmed.\nOur intellectual property is essential to our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. To date, we have only four issued U.S. patents (including a corresponding Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) international patent for three of the four U.S. patents) and only seven U.S. patent applications currently outstanding, including one that we inherited through acquisitions (and we have four corresponding PCT international patent applications), so we will not be able to protect the majority of our technologies from independent invention by third parties. In addition, we have filed foreign patent applications on three of our eight U.S. patent applications and one of the issued U.S. patents, and an additional foreign patent application for our one of our issued U.S. patents. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise to obtain and use our technology and games, and some parties have distributed \u201cjail broken\u201d versions of our games where all of the content has been unlocked and made available for free. Further, some of our competitors have released games that are nearly identical to successful games released by their competitors in an effort to confuse the market and divert users from the competitor\u2019s game to the copycat game. We believe that these tactics were employed by Hothead Games in their game Kill Shot, which we believed infringed certain Glu copyrights and trade dress contained in our Deer Hunter 2014 game. We initiated litigation against Hothead Games in November 2014, and we entered into a settlement agreement with Hothead in August 2015 in which Hothead agreed to make payments to us, including ongoing payments, and we agreed to allow Hothead to continue to publish the Kill Shot game. To the extent competitors continue to copy our games, it could reduce the amount of revenue we are able to generate from any infringed games. Monitoring unauthorized use of our games is difficult and costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent piracy and other unauthorized distribution and use of our technology and games, particularly in certain international jurisdictions, such as China, where the laws may not protect our intellectual property rights as fully as in the United States. In the future, we may institute additional litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and our resources.\nIn addition, although we require our third-party developers to sign agreements not to disclose or improperly use our trade secrets, to acknowledge that all inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf are our property and to assign to us any ownership they may have in those works, it may still be possible for third parties to obtain and improperly use our intellectual properties without our consent. This could harm our brand, business, operating results and financial condition.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may become involved in intellectual property disputes, which may disrupt our business and require us to pay significant damage awards.\nThird parties may sue us for intellectual property infringement, or initiate proceedings to invalidate our intellectual property, which, if successful, could disrupt our business, cause us to pay significant damage awards or require us to pay licensing fees. For example, on August 20, 2014, Inventor Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that we were infringing one of its patents and seeking unspecified damages, including interest, costs, expenses and an accounting of all infringing acts, attorneys\u2019 fees and such other costs as the Court deems just and proper. In September 2015, the Court granted our motion to dismiss the case brought by Inventor Holdings. In addition, in November 2014, Telinit Technologies, LLC, a Texas company, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division, alleging that we were infringing one of its patents and seeking unspecified damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. We settled the dispute with Telinit for an immaterial amount in January 2015. Finally, in November 2015, Just Games Interactive LLC (d/b/a Kung Fu Factory, f/k/a Tiny Fun Studios), or Just Games, filed a complaint against us and Kristen Jenner (f/k/a Kris Kardashian) in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The complaint alleged direct copyright infringement against us and seeking at least $10.0 million in damages as well as other relief, including costs, permanent and temporary injunctive relief, an accounting of profits, a constructive trust and such other costs the Court deemed just and proper. We filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on January 27, 2016. On February 1, 2016, Just Games filed a voluntary motion to dismiss their case against us without prejudice. Despite our prior successes in defending against such claims, claims against us in the future could result in our being enjoined from using our intellectual property or licensed intellectual property, and we might incur significant licensing fees and could be forced to develop alternative technologies. We may also be required to pay penalties, judgments, royalties or significant settlement costs. If we fail or are unable to develop non-infringing technology or games or to license the infringed or similar technology or games on a timely basis, we may be forced to withdraw games from the market or be prevented from introducing new games. We might also incur substantial expenses in defending against third-party claims, regardless of their merit.\nIn addition, we use open source software in some of our games and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. We may face claims from companies that incorporate open source software into their products, claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, the open source software and/or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our games, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results.\nWe may become a party to litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nWe may become subject to various legal proceedings, claims and regulatory inquiries that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business and are not yet resolved and additional claims and inquiries may arise in the future. In addition, events may occur that give rise to a potential risk of litigation. The number and significance of regulatory inquiries have increased as our business has grown and evolved. Any proceedings, claims or inquiries initiated by or against us, whether successful or not, may be time consuming; result in costly litigation, damage awards, consent decrees, injunctive relief or increased costs of doing business, require us to change our business practices or products, require significant amounts of management time, result in diversion of significant operations resources or otherwise harm our business and future financial results.\n\u201cCheating\u201d programs, scam offers, black-markets and other offerings or actions by unrelated third parties that seek to exploit our games and players affect the game-playing experience and may lead players to stop playing our games or divert revenue to unrelated third parties.\nUnrelated third parties have developed, and may continue to develop, \u201ccheating\u201d programs, scam offers, black-markets and other offerings that may decrease our revenue generated from our virtual economies, divert our players from our games or otherwise harm us. Cheating programs enable players to exploit vulnerabilities in our games to obtain\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nvirtual currency or other items that would otherwise generate in-app purchases for us, play the games in automated ways or obtain unfair advantages over other players who do play fairly. Unrelated third parties attempt to scam our players with fake offers for virtual goods or other game benefits. We devote resources to discover and disable these programs and activities, but if we are unable to do so in a prompt and timely manner, our operations may be disrupted, our reputation damaged and players may play our games less frequently or stop playing our games altogether. This may lead to lost revenue from paying players, increased cost of developing technological measures to combat these programs and activities, legal claims relating to the diminution in value of our virtual currency and goods, and increased customer service costs needed to respond to disgruntled players.\nUnanticipated changes in our income tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities may affect our future financial results.\nOur future effective income tax rates may be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Determining our worldwide provision for income taxes requires significant judgments. The estimation process and applicable laws are inherently uncertain, and our estimates are not binding on tax authorities. Our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Recent and contemplated changes to U.S. tax laws, including limitations on a taxpayer\u2019s ability to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and defer certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the United States are repatriated to the United States, could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. Further, the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including our transfer pricing, or determine that the manner in which we operate our business is not consistent with the manner in which we report our income to the jurisdictions, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. Foreign tax authorities may also interpret or change tax regulations such that we may be subject to tax liabilities upon closure or liquidation of a foreign subsidiary. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine if our provision for income taxes is adequate. These continuous examinations may result in unforeseen tax-related liabilities, which may harm our future financial results.\nWe must charge, collect and/or pay taxes other than income taxes, such as payroll, value-added, sales and use, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and foreign jurisdiction. If tax authorities assert that we have taxable nexus in a jurisdiction, they may seek to impose past as well as future tax liability and/or penalties. Any such impositions could also cause significant administrative burdens and decrease our future sales. Moreover, state and federal legislatures have been considering various initiatives that could change our tax position regarding sales and use taxes.\nFinally, as we change our international operations, adopt new products and new distribution models, implement changes to our operating structure or undertake intercompany transactions in light of changing tax laws, our tax expense could increase.\nOur facilities are located near known earthquake fault zones, and the occurrence of an earthquake or other natural disaster could damage our facilities and equipment, which could require us to curtail or cease operations.\nOur principal offices are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, an area known for earthquakes. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including power loss, fires, explosions, floods, communications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events. If any natural or other disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business could be impaired.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research about our business, or publish negative or misinformed reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline and/or become more volatile.\nThe trading market for our common stock is affected by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncover us downgrade our shares or lower their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. In addition, our share price and the volatility of our shares can be affected by misinformed or mistaken research reports on our business.\nOur common stock price may be affected by third-party data regarding our games.\nThird parties publish daily data about us and other mobile gaming companies with respect to downloads of our games, daily and monthly active users and estimated revenue generated by our games. These metrics can be volatile, particularly for specific games, and in many cases do not accurately reflect the actual levels of usage of our games across all platforms or the revenue generated by our games. To the extent that securities analysts or investors base their views of our business or prospects on such third-party data, the price of our common stock may be affected by such third party data and may not reflect the actual performance of our business.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales might occur, could reduce the price that our common stock might otherwise attain and may dilute your voting power and your ownership interest in us.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock could decline as a result of substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors and their affiliates, executive officers, employees and significant stockholders, under our current shelf registration statements, through a large number of shares of our common stock becoming available for sale, or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares. For example, Tencent is free to sell the 21,000,000 shares it acquired from us in the second quarter of 2015 on the open-market, subject only to our black-out periods and other limitations under our insider trading policy. In addition, we issued 9,982,886 shares in connection with our acquisition of Cie Games, Inc. in August 2014. We filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 covering the resale of such shares. Accordingly, the shares issued in the Cie Games acquisition are subject to only limited re-sale restrictions and sales of substantial amounts of such shares may occur.\nSome provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, may deter third parties from seeking to acquire us.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u00b7\nonly our chairman of the board, our lead independent director, our Chief Executive Officer, our president or a majority of our board of directors is authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nour stockholders are able to take action only at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u00b7\nonly our board of directors and not our stockholders is able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nour certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval; and\n\u00b7\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before a meeting of stockholders.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents certain stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding common stock not held by such 15% or greater stockholder, although our board of directors waived this provision with respect to Tencent\u2019s potential acquisition of greater than 15% of our shares in connection with the transaction in which we initially sold shares of our common stock to an affiliate of Tencent.\nWe have no plans to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not have any plans to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.", "PERMNO": 91900, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "GLUU"}
