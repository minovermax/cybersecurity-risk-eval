{"cik": "1002135", "company": "WESTELL TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-05-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information contained and incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or those risks we currently view to be immaterial, may also materially and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. If any of these risks materialize, our business, operating results or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe have incurred losses in the past and may incur losses in the future.\nWe have incurred losses in recent fiscal years and historically in fiscal years through 2002. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $353.5 million as of March 31, 2021.\nWe expect to continue to evaluate new product and growth opportunities. As a result, we will continue to invest in research and development as well as sales and marketing, which could adversely affect our short-term operating results as we pursue\npotential growth opportunities. We cannot provide any certainty that these efforts will be successful or that we will be profitable in the future.\nOur business operations and financial condition have been adversely impacted, and may continue to be materially and adversely affected, by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and other outbreaks of infectious diseases may have a similar\nimpact.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our operations. The pandemic continues to limit hands-on product demonstrations and face-to-face customer meetings, and has also limited the Company's ability to attend industry tradeshows. All of these disruptions have negatively impacted our ability to generate new business. Limited or restricted travel to customer worksites, which is required for our IBW and ISM products, may continue to have an adverse impact on our business. Government regulations or economic impacts due to COVID-19 have and may continue to reduce or delay construction projects, for many of our products, such as IBW products, that are installed during new construction and major renovations.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, delays in receiving necessary parts and supplies from our vendors due to the impact of the pandemic. We have sourced, and may have to continue to source, parts from alternate suppliers with higher costs or expediting fees that cannot be passed along to the end customers. Our manufacturing facility or a facility at one of our contract manufacturers could be shut down if there is a significant spread of illness in the plant.\nOn April 14, 2020, the Company received $1.6 million pursuant to a loan from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"JPM\") under the Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cPPP\u201d) of the 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d) as administered by the U.S. Small Business Association (the \u201cSBA\u201d). Funds from the loan may only be used for certain purposes, including payroll, benefits, rent and utilities. On March 16, 2021, JPM notified the Company that 100% of the initial PPP loan was forgiven as authorized by the SBA. On March 22, 2021, the Company received an additional $1.6 million second draw PPP loan ( the \"PPP2\") pursuant to a loan from St. Charles Bank & Trust Company, N.A. (\u201cWintrust\u201d) under the Consolidated Appropriation Act, 2021 that was signed into law in December 2020. The Company will carefully monitor qualifying expenses and other requirements in an effort to properly maximize loan forgiveness, but the Company can provide no assurance that the PPP2 will be forgiven in whole or in part.\nIf the COVID-19 pandemic is not effectively and timely controlled, especially as new variants continue to evolve, our business operations and financial condition may continue to be materially and adversely affected. There is significant uncertainty around sales, supply chain availability, cash collections, costs related to our mediation efforts and other pandemic-related expenses. These uncertainties include the duration and severity of the pandemic and current, as well as future, containment measures, and how our compliance with these measures will impact our day-to-day operations as well as that of our customers, contract manufacturers and other supply chain partners. Any of these factors, as well as other factors beyond our control, could have an adverse effect on the overall business environment and cause our business to suffer in ways that we cannot predict at this time and that may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have in the past and may in the future experience significant delays or other complications in the design, manufacture, launch, and production ramp of new products, which could harm our business, prospects, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nMany of our past sales have resulted from our ability to anticipate changes in technology, industry standards and service provider service offerings, and to develop and introduce new and enhanced products and services. Our continued ability to adapt to such changes will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and our prospects for growth. Additionally, other companies may succeed in developing and marketing products that are more effective and/or less costly than any product we may develop, or that are commercially accepted before any of our products.\nThere can be no assurance that we will successfully introduce new products on a timely basis or achieve sales of new products in the future, particularly as customer demand shifts to new technology or the next generation of products. Additionally, we rely on third parties to perform a portion of our research and development activities. Accordingly, the failure of third party research partners to perform under agreements entered into with us, or our failure to renew important agreements with these third party research parties, may delay or curtail our research and development efforts. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will have the financial and product design resources necessary to continue to successfully develop new products or to otherwise successfully respond to changing technology standards and service provider service offerings. If we fail to deploy new products on a timely basis, our product sales may decrease and our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may experience significant delays or other complications in bringing to market and ramping production of new products, such as our new public safety products. Currently, there are competitive products in the public safety market that have already launched.\nThe decision to curtail the development of new products or other complications in the development, manufacture, launch, and production ramp of any future product have in the past and could in the future materially damage our business, prospects, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers who are able to exert a high degree of influence over us and loss of or a significant reduction of spending by a major customer would adversely impact our business.\nWe have and may continue to depend on U.S. telecommunication service providers for the majority of our revenues. Telecommunications companies and our other customers typically are significantly larger than we are and are able to exert a high degree of influence over us. Customers may often be permitted to reschedule orders without penalty. Even if demand for our products is high, many telecommunication service providers have sufficient bargaining power to demand low prices and other terms and conditions that may materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur performance is dependent on customer capital spending, which can be volatile and difficult to forecast. Customer capital spending can be affected by end user demand driven by competing technology, economic conditions, customer budget restraints, work stoppages or other labor issues at the facilities of our customers and other factors. Our customers have curtailed or deferred spending in the past without notice.\nOverall sales and product mix sold to our large customers have fluctuated in the past and could vary in the future resulting in significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results and may also adversely impact our stock price.\nWe have completed acquisitions in the past and may engage in future acquisitions that could impact our financial results or stock price.\nWe have completed acquisitions in the past and expect to continue to review potential acquisitions, and we may acquire or make investments in businesses, products or technologies in the future. Any existing or substantial future acquisitions or investments would present a number of risks that could harm our business including:\n\u2022business integration issues;\n\u2022disruption to our ongoing or acquired business;\n\u2022difficulty realizing the intended benefits of the transaction;\n\u2022impairment of assets related to acquired goodwill and intangibles; and\n\u2022key employee retention.\nFuture acquisitions or investments could also result in use of significant cash balances, potential dilutive issuances of equity securities or incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have long-term customer pricing contracts but few long-term contracts or arrangements with our suppliers, including temporary labor, which could adversely affect our ability, with certainty or economically, to purchase components and technologies used in our products or to economically manufacture products.\nAlthough we have long-term customer pricing contracts, we have few long-term contracts or arrangements with our suppliers. Due to supply and demand of component parts for our products, we have seen a trend of price increases and longer lead-times. We are increasingly having to consider air freight as compared to sea freight from our partners in Asia in order to supply products to meet customer demand, causing increased costs. We may not be able to obtain products or components at competitive prices, in sufficient quantities or under other commercially reasonable terms. Due to supply and demand of labor to produce and install our products, we have seen a trend of labor rate increases. Because of our long-term customer pricing contracts, we may be unable to pass any significant increase in product costs on to our customers, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur lack of backlog and market visibility may affect our ability to adjust for unexpected changes in customer demand.\nCustomers often place orders for product within the month of their requested delivery date. We therefore typically do not have a material backlog (or known quantity) of unfilled orders, and our revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked or orders becoming non-cancellable in that quarter. Our expense levels and inventory commitments are based on anticipated customer demand and are relatively fixed in the short term. If we enter into a high-volume or long-term supply arrangement and subsequently decide that we cannot use the products or services provided for in the supply arrangement then our business could also be harmed. We enter into short-term contracts with our suppliers in the form of purchase orders. These purchase orders are issued to vendors based on forecasted customer demand. Therefore, we may be unable to cancel purchase orders with our suppliers or adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall of orders. Accordingly, any significant shortfall of demand in relation to our expectations or any material delay of customer orders could have an adverse impact on our business, our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face significant inventory risk.\nWe are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, defective products, changes in customer demand and spending patterns, and other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid over-stocking or under-stocking products we assemble and/or sell. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered/assembled and the dates of customer orders. With the current global shortages of many electronic components, as well as high demand for steel and aluminum products, we are faced with having to carry additional inventory. Transportation disruptions due to container shortages and back-ups at ports create additional pressure to increase safety-stock inventory levels. In addition, when we begin marketing a new product, it may be difficult to determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-times and they may not be returnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating results.\nConversely, if we order too little product to meet customer demand, we may have insufficient inventory which could result in unplanned expediting costs or lost revenue opportunities, either of which could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur customers have lengthy purchase cycles and unpredictable purchasing practices that affect our ability to sell our products.\nPrior to selling products to service providers, we must undergo the lengthy approval and purchase processes of our customers. Evaluation can take as little as a few months for products that vary slightly from existing products or up to a year or more for products based on new technologies or utilized for new service offerings. Customers may also choose not to utilize our offerings. Accordingly, we are continually submitting successive generations of our current products as well as new products to our customers for approval.\nThe requirement that service providers obtain FCC, UL, or state regulatory approval for most new telecommunications and broadband services prior to their implementation has in the past delayed the approval process. Such delays in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. While we have been successful in the past in obtaining product approvals from our customers, there is no guarantee that such approvals, or that ensuing sales of such products, will continue to occur.\nOur business is subject to the risks of international operations.\nWe are dependent on our independent offshore manufacturing partners in Asia to manufacture, assemble and test our products. Although there typically is no unique capability with these suppliers, any failure or business disruption by these suppliers to meet delivery commitments would cause us to delay shipments and potentially lose revenue and/or incur contractual penalties. Our reliance on third-party subcontractors for assembly of our products involves several risks, including the unavailability of, or interruptions in access to, certain process technologies and reduced control over product quality, delivery schedules, transportation, manufacturing yields, and costs. These risks may be exacerbated by economic or political uncertainties, terrorist actions, civil unrest or by pandemics or other outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or other disasters in countries in which our subcontractors or their subcontractors are located. Contracts with our CMs are generally expressed in U.S. dollars, but volatility in foreign currency rates could increase our costs.\nWe aim to derive an increased portion of our revenue from international operations. As a result, our financial condition and operating results could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, such as economic, political, and other risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, regional or country specific economic downturns, changes in tariffs and tax laws, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, complications in complying with, or exposure to liability under, a variety of laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws and regulations, political instability, significant natural disasters and\nother events or factors impacting local infrastructure. Requirements for international expansion may increase our operating expenses or working capital needs.\nDue to the rapid pace of technological change and volatile customer demand, our products may become obsolete and could cause us to incur charges for excess and obsolete inventory, which would materially harm our business.\nThe telecommunications industry is subject to rapid technological changes and volatile customer demands, which have affected our past results and could result in inventory obsolescence or excess inventory. We have in the past and may in the future devote disproportionate resources to a product that we ultimately may not sell or have to sell for a loss. If we incur substantial inventory impairments that we are not able to recover because of changing market conditions, or if we commit resources that do not result in profitable sales, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products and services face intense competition. Our failure to compete successfully could materially affect our profitability.\nBecause we are smaller than many of our competitors, we may lack the financial, marketing, technical and other resources needed to increase or maintain our market share. Many of our competitors are larger than we are and may be able to offer a wider array of products and services required for a service provider\u2019s business than we do.\nCompetitors may succeed in establishing more technologically advanced products and services, or products with more favorable pricing or may otherwise gain an advantage over our products, which would result in lost business that would adversely impact our profitability.\nBecause of intense competition, we may price our products and services at low margins in order to win or maintain business. Low margins from our sales of products and services could materially and adversely affect our profitability and ability to achieve our business goals.\nWe are dependent on third-party technology, the loss of which would harm our business.\nWe rely on third parties for technology in our products. Consequently, we must rely upon third parties to develop and to introduce technologies which enhance the Company's current products and enable the Company, in turn, to develop its own products on a timely and cost-effective basis to meet changing customer needs and technological trends in the telecommunications industry. Were the Company to lose the ability to obtain needed technology from a supplier, or were that technology no longer available to the Company under reasonable terms and conditions, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on sole or limited source suppliers and independent contract manufacturers and the loss or disruptions of these products and services would harm our business.\nComponents used in our products may be currently available from only one source or a limited number of suppliers. Our inability to obtain sufficient key components or to develop alternative sources for key components as required, could result in delays or reductions in product deliveries, and consequently severely harm our customer relationships and our business. Furthermore, additional sole-source components may be incorporated into our future products, thereby increasing our supplier risks. If any of our sole-source suppliers delay or halt production of any of their components, or fail to supply their components on commercially reasonable terms, then our business and operating results would be harmed.\nIn the event that these suppliers discontinue the manufacture of materials used in our products, we would be forced to incur the time and expense of finding a new supplier, if available, or to modify our products in such a way that such materials were not necessary, which could result in increased manufacturing costs.\nWe are dependent on independent contract manufacturers. In February 2021, a small fire at a subcontractor destroyed inventory that was being used to produce some of Westell\u2019s products. Insurance policies are expected, but not guaranteed, to cover the replacement value of the assets that incurred losses or damages, less a $50,000 deductible. The loss of the inventory caused delays in delivering products and a decision to accelerate engineering efforts to develop a new replacement product. During fiscal year 2017, the Company increased reliance on a single contract manufacturer to fully outsource final assembly and test operations for its IBW products. In fiscal year 2020, we expanded the number of products that will be assembled by that CM. These additional products include: full outsource assembly and testing of the IBW segment licensed public safety products as well as assembly of the ISM segment's remote sub-assemblies. Any disruption in assembly, test or shipment services, delays in manufacturing processes and ramping up volume for new products, transitions to new service providers or any other circumstances that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply, could delay shipments and have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands. In addition, unpredictable economic conditions may adversely impact the financial health and viability of these contract manufacturers and result in their insolvency or their inability to meet their commitments to us. These factors could result in reduced revenues and could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to effectively manage human capital resources, including retaining and hiring additional key personnel, we will not be able to successfully compete, develop and sell products and services.\nBecause of our need to continually compete for customer business, our success is dependent on our ability to effectively management human capital resources, including attracting and retaining qualified technical, marketing, sales and management personnel. To remain competitive, we must maintain top management talent, employees who are involved in product development and testing and employees who have developed strong customer relationships. Due to the high demand for these types of employees, it may be difficult to retain existing key employees and attract new key employees. In addition, we do not have non-compete contracts with most of our employees. Our inability to attract and retain key employees could harm our ability to successfully sell existing products, develop new products, and implement our business goals.\nIndustry consolidation and divestiture could make competing more difficult.\nConsolidation of companies offering competing products is occurring through acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing arrangements involving our competitors, our customers and our customers\u2019 competitors.\nOur customers may acquire, merge or divest territories to other telecommunication service providers. The acquiring companies often use competitor products in their legacy business. We are often required to formally bid to retain existing business or obtain new business in the acquirer\u2019s territory.\nWe cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated telecommunications industry or retain or win business when existing customers divest portions of their business to others. Any heightened competitive pressures that we may face may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nUtilization of our deferred tax assets could be limited by an ownership change as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, or by a change in the tax code, or by our ability to generate future taxable income.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets, primarily in the form of net operating losses, which are generally available to offset future taxable income. If we fail to generate sufficient future taxable income, net operating losses would expire prior to utilization. A valuation allowance was recorded against all deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. The Company remains in a full valuation allowance position as of March 31, 2021. A change in ownership, as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, could reduce the availability of those tax assets. Additional federal or state tax code changes could further limit our use of deferred tax assets and harm our business and our investors.\nWe have and may incur liabilities in connection with the sale of certain assets and discontinued operations.\nIn connection with our divestitures, we have agreed to indemnify parties against specified losses with respect to those transactions and retained responsibility for various legal liabilities that may accrue. The indemnities relate to, among other things, liabilities which may arise with respect to the period during which we operated the divested business, and to certain ongoing contractual relationships and entitlements with respect to which we made commitments in connection with the divestiture. We have incurred and may incur additional expenses defending indemnity and third party claims. These added expenses to resolve the claim or to defend against the third party action could harm our operating results. In addition, such claims may divert management attention from our continuing business. It may also be difficult to determine whether a claim from a third party stemmed from actions taken by us or by another party and we may expend substantial resources trying to determine which party has responsibility for the claim.\nAny restructuring activities that we have undertaken and may undertake in the future may not achieve the benefits anticipated and could result in additional unanticipated costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nIn order to align our resources with our growth strategies, operate more efficiently and control costs, recently and in the past, we have periodically announced restructuring plans, which include workforce reductions, facility closures and consolidations, asset impairments and other cost reduction initiatives. We regularly evaluate our existing operations and, as a result of such evaluations, may undertake additional restructuring activities within our business. These restructuring activities may involve higher costs or longer timetables than we anticipate, including costs related to severance and other employee-related matters, litigation risks and expenses, and other costs. These restructuring activities may disrupt sales or operations and may not result in improvements in future financial performance. If we incur unanticipated costs or are unable to realize the benefits related to restructuring activities, the activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nAn impairment of long-lived assets could adversely impact our reported financial results.\nEvents or circumstances could arise that may create a need to record an impairment charge related to our long-lived assets that could adversely impact our reported financial results.\nOur business may be affected by uncertain government regulation, and current or future laws or regulations could restrict the way we operate our business or impose additional costs on our business.\nThe telecommunications industry, including most of our customers, is subject to regulation from federal and state agencies, including the FCC and various state public utility and service commissions. While most of these regulations do not affect us directly, the effects of regulations on our customers may adversely impact our business and operating results. For example, FCC regulatory policies affecting the availability of telecommunication company services and other terms on which telecommunication companies conduct their business may impede our penetration of local access markets, and/or make the markets less financially attractive.\nOur inability to successfully maintain business continuity could impair our ability to deliver our products and services and harm our business.\nWe are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure to provide our products and services to our customers. A disruption or failure of these systems or operations because of relocation, the failure to successfully upgrade our systems, a disaster, or other business continuity event could cause data corruption, missing data or data lost or otherwise delay our ability to complete sales and provide the highest level of service to our customers. In addition, we could have difficulty producing accurate financial statements on a timely basis, which could adversely affect the trading value of our stock. Although we endeavor to ensure there is redundancy in these systems and that they are regularly backed-up, there are no assurances that data recovery in the event of a disaster or other event would be effective or occur in an efficient manner. Any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our products and services could harm our reputation and may damage our customers\u2019 businesses, which could lead to the loss of business, adversely impact our financial results, lead to litigation and/or cause us to incur significant costs to resolve the issue.\nOur failure or the failure of third-party service providers to protect our sites, networks and systems against security breaches, or otherwise to protect our confidential information, could adversely affect our business and financial results as well as damage our reputation.\nOur business systems collect, maintain, transmit or store data about our customers, vendors and others, including credit card information and personally identifiable information, as well as other confidential and proprietary information. We also employ third-party service providers that store, process and transmit proprietary, personal and confidential information on our behalf. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties in an effort to securely transmit confidential and sensitive information, including credit card numbers. Our security measures, and those of our third-party service providers, may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, ransomware attacks, security breaches or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by our sites, networks and systems that we or our third-party service providers otherwise maintain.\nWe and our service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all types of attacks and techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems that change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. These risks may be heightened by having a portion of our workforce working remotely due to the pandemic. Although we maintain privacy, data breach and network security liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate or cover liabilities actually incurred, or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Any compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws, and cause significant legal and financial exposure, adverse publicity, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results as well as damage our reputation.\nRisks Related to Litigation and Related Matters\nWe may be subject to litigation that could be costly to defend and could impact our profitability.\nOur products use third party and open source intellectual property. The telecommunications industry is characterized by the existence of an increasing number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent and other intellectual property infringement. From time to time we receive communications from third parties alleging infringement of exclusive patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to us. Such litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial costs and thus adversely impact our profitability. We could face securities litigation or other litigation that could result in the payment of substantial damages or settlement costs in excess of our insurance coverage. Any adverse outcome could harm our business. Even if we were to prevail in any such litigation, we could incur substantial legal costs and management's attention and resources could be diverted from our business which could cause our business to suffer.\nOur indemnification obligations for infringement by our products of the rights of others could require us to pay substantial damages.\nAs is common in our industry, we have a number of agreements in which we have agreed to defend, indemnify and hold harmless our customers and suppliers from damages and costs that arise from the infringement by our products of third-party patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights. The scope of these indemnities varies, the duration of these indemnities is generally perpetual after execution of an agreement, and the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnities is often unlimited. Any indemnification claims by customers could require us to incur significant legal fees and could potentially result in our payment of substantial damages, and our insurance generally would not cover these fees or damages. As a result, the occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nPotential product recalls, service failures and warranty expenses could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur products are required to meet rigorous standards imposed by our customers, and we warrant the performance of these products and services. In addition, our supply contracts with our major customers typically require us to accept returns of products within certain time frames and indemnify such customers against certain liabilities arising out of the use of our products or services. Complex products such as those offered by us may contain undetected defects or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released. Despite our testing of products and our comprehensive quality control program, there is no guarantee that our products will not suffer from defects or other deficiencies. If product defects, recalls, warranty returns, failures, or indemnification or liquidated-damage claims exceed our anticipated costs for these items, our business could be harmed. Such claims and the associated negative publicity could result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and services, and could affect our product sales, our customer relationships, and our profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe Company has delisted the Class A Common Stock from the Nasdaq Stock Market and SEC reporting requirements were automatically suspended beginning with the fiscal year that commended on April 1, 2021.\nIn October 2020, we filed a Form 25 and Form 15 with the SEC to delist and deregister our Class A Common Stock. As a result, our Class A Common Stock is no longer listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and trading in our Class A Common Stock will only occur in privately negotiated sales and on the OTC Pink Open Market, if one or more brokers continues to choose to make a market for our Class A Common Stock there and complies with applicable regulatory requirements; however, there can be no assurances regarding any such trading. Because of the limited liquidity for our Class A Common Stock, the planned termination of our obligation to publicly disclose financial and other information on the SEC website, and the deregistration of our Class A Common Stock under the Exchange Act, our stockholders may potentially experience a significant decrease in the value of their Class A Common Stock.\nWe intend to continue to prepare audited annual financial statements and periodic unaudited financial statements on the OTC Market website beginning with quarter ending June 30, 2021, but could reassess in the future. Nonetheless, stockholders will have significantly less information about the Company and our business, operations, and financial performance than they have currently. We intend to continue to hold stockholder meetings as required under Delaware law, including annual meetings, or to take actions by written consent of our stockholders in lieu of meetings.\nFollowing the completion of the deregistration process, we will no longer be subject to the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or the liability provisions of the Exchange Act. Additionally, we will not have the ability to access the public capital markets or to use public securities in attracting and retaining executives and other employees, and we will have a decreased ability to use stock to acquire other companies.\nAdditionally, our public reporting obligations could again be reinstated if on the first day of any fiscal year we have more than 300 stockholders of record, in which instance we would be required to resume reporting pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act.\nWe could be the subject of future investigation by governmental authorities that could adversely affect\nour financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nIn the event that an investigation by governmental authorities leads to significant legal expense or to action against the Company or its directors and officers, our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock may be adversely impacted.\nWhile our Class A Common Stock is traded on the OTC Pink Open Market, its price is characterized by significant price volatility.\nOur stock price has demonstrated and may continue to demonstrate volatility as valuations, trading volumes and prices vary significantly. Such volatility may result in a material decline in the market price of our securities, and may have little relationship to our financial results or prospects.\nWhile our Class A Common Stock is traded on the OTC Pink Open Market, its trading price is characterized by significant volatility when compared to the shares of larger, more established companies that have large public floats, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than the shares of such larger, more established companies traded on the major markets for the indefinite future.\nThe volatility in our share price is attributable to a number of factors. First, as noted above, our Class A Common Stock is, compared to the shares of such larger, more established companies, sporadically and thinly traded. As a consequence of this limited liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction. The price for our shares could, for example, decline precipitously in the event that a large number of our common stock is sold on the market without commensurate demand. As a consequence of this enhanced risk, more risk-adverse investors may, under the fear of losing all or most of their investment in the event of negative news or lack of progress, be more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a larger, more established company that has a large public float. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our Class A Common Stock, regardless of our operating performance. We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our Class A Common Stock will be at any time, including as to whether our Class A Common Stock will sustain its current market price, or as to what effect that the sale of shares or the availability of Class A Common Stock for sale at any time will have on the prevailing market price, or if our Class A Common Stock will continue to be traded on the OTC Pink Open Market.\nOur principal stockholders can exercise significant influence that could discourage transactions involving a change of control and may affect your ability to receive a premium for Class A Common Stock that you purchase.\nAs of May 14, 2021, as trustees of a voting trust dated February 23, 1994, (the \u201cVoting Trust\u201d) containing common stock held for the benefit of the Penny family, Robert C. Penny III, Robert W. Foskett and Patrick J. McDonough, Jr. have the exclusive power to vote over 60.0% of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of our common stock. In addition, members of the Penny family who are beneficiaries under this Voting Trust are parties to a stock transfer restriction agreement which prohibits the beneficiaries from transferring any Class B Common Stock or their beneficial interests in the Voting Trust without first offering such Class B Common Stock to the other Penny family members. Certain Penny family members also own or are beneficiaries of trusts that own shares outside of the Voting Trust. As trustees of the Voting Trust and other trusts, Messrs. Penny, Foskett and McDonough, Jr. control 65.2% of the stock vote. Consequently, we are effectively under the control of Messrs. Penny, Foskett and McDonough, Jr., as trustees, who can effectively control the election of all of the directors and determine the outcome of most corporate transactions or other matters submitted to the stockholders for approval. Such control may have the effect of discouraging transactions involving an actual or potential change of control, including transactions in which the holders of Class A Common Stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price.", "PERMNO": 82762, "SIC": 3661, "TIC": "WSTL"}
