{"cik": "1289419", "company": "Morningstar, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all of the other information included in this report when deciding whether to invest in our common stock or otherwise evaluating our business. If any of the following risks or uncertainties materialize, our business, financial condition, or operating results could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Our operations could also be affected by other risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nFailing to maintain and protect our brand, independence, and reputation may harm our business. Our reputation and business may also be harmed by allegations made about possible conflicts of interest, by other negative publicity or media reports, or by adverse outcomes in regulatory proceedings.\nWe believe that our brand is well recognized and highly regarded at both a corporate and product level among key decision makers at purchasers and users of our products and services. We also believe independence is at the core of our brand and business, and our reputation is one of our greatest corporate assets. We rely on our reputation for integrity and high-caliber products and services as a competitive advantage. Any failure to uphold our high ethical standards and ensure that our customers have a consistently positive experience with us could damage our reputation, either as an objective, honest, and credible source for investment and credit research and information or as a trusted solutions provider to our asset management and investment advisory customers, or both. Our ESG offerings insert Morningstar very publicly into the debate over a variety of non-financial issues around the environment, social concerns, and corporate governance, and our position as a leading source of ESG research and opinions may cause proponents of various causes to demand that we publicly take stands on a variety of controversial topics not directly related to our corporate mission. Allegations of improper conduct, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity or media reports about Morningstar, whether valid or not, may harm our reputation and damage our business. In addition, any failures by us to continue to instill effectively in our employees the non-negotiable expectation of independence and integrity may devalue our reputation over time. Morningstar\u2019s corporate culture and reputation contribute to our ability to attract and retain talent, and reputational damage could negatively affect both our hiring and employee retention.\nAs our business has evolved, we have entered lines of business and business arrangements that may give rise to allegations of conflicts of interest or perceived failures of our independence. We provide ratings, analyst research, and investment recommendations on mutual funds and other investment products offered by our institutional clients. While we don\u2019t charge asset management firms for their products to be rated, we do charge licensing fees for the use of our ratings. We also provide investment advisory and investment management services, including through our own series of mutual funds, which exposes us to the claim that we are acting as both a referee and a player in the investment management industry. In our credit rating business, which we significantly expanded through the purchase of DBRS, we are participants in an issuer-pay business model under which we receive payments from issuers for our credit ratings rather than from the investors who consume such ratings. An issuer pay model also applies to Sustainalytics\u2019 Sustainable Finance Solutions business unit products and services. These payments may create the perception that our credit ratings and research are not independently determined or reliable. We evaluate the potential impact of ESG factors on other companies and risk a claim of hypocrisy if we take or fail to take corporate actions that are or seem inconsistent with our view of best corporate practices.\nOur business expansion has also resulted in greater exposure to governmental regulation across our product lines. In some cases, such as with respect to our credit ratings business, interactions with regulators are extensive and continuous, raising the risk that they may result in enforcement investigations and proceedings. To the extent any of those investigations or proceedings result in a finding of misconduct or noncompliance, they could pose a significant reputational risk to us and negatively impact our business.\nOur reputation may also be harmed by factors outside of our control, such as news reports about our clients, consultants, or partners or adverse publicity about certain investment and ratings products. Our reputation could also suffer if we fail to perform competitively in our investment management offerings.\nProlonged volatility or downturns affecting the financial sector, global financial markets, and the global economy may impact our results, resulting in lower revenue from asset-based fees and credit ratings business, as well as other parts of our business to a lesser extent.\nOur business results are partly driven by factors outside of our control, including general economic and financial market trends. Any unfavorable changes in the market environment in which we operate could cause a corresponding negative effect on our business results. As a result, we may experience lower revenue, operating income, and other financial results in the event of a market downturn.\nFor our licensed-based businesses, many of our customers are asset-management firms and other financial-services companies, which are also subject to external trends and changes. For example, the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 led to sustained spending cutbacks among many of the companies to which we sell. Some institutional clients implemented additional review processes for new contracts or started providing certain services, such as investment management, in-house rather than hiring outside service providers. There is currently uncertainty regarding the duration and long-term economic and societal consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effects of unprecedented levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus, which may cause clients to modify spending decisions. Consolidation in the financial services sector has in the past, and may in the future, reduce the number of potential clients for our products and services. These trends could impact demand for our products and services or change the financial services landscape in which we operate.\nMany companies in the financial services industry have also been subject to increasing government regulation and pressure to reduce fees. In turn, many of these firms have sought to reduce their operating costs by working with fewer service providers and/or negotiating lower fees for services they purchase.\nOur PitchBook business may also be subject to cyclical trends specific to the private capital markets. Many of PitchBook's clients are investment banks and other participants in the capital and M&A markets, which are subject to periodic business downturns driven by changes in such markets. During these downturns, they often seek to reduce spending on third-party services, as well as the number of employees, which would directly affect the number of prospective clients for PitchBook. As a data and research provider focusing on the private capital markets (including venture capital, private equity, and M&A), PitchBook may also be subject to volatility based on the amount of activity and market interest in these areas.\nThe amount of asset-based revenue we earn primarily depends on the value of assets on which we provide advisory services, and the size of our asset base can increase or decrease along with trends in market performance. Our revenue from asset-based fees may be adversely affected by market declines, cash outflows from portfolios that we help manage, and the industrywide trend toward lower asset-based fees. Concerns about asset price bubbles, in particular in equities, have proliferated as the performance of the stock market appears disconnected from the real economy where the COVID-19 pandemic has had a greater negative impact on employment, spending, and general consumer economic activity.\nAsset levels can also be affected if net inflows into the portfolios on which we provide investment advisory services drop or if these portfolios experience redemptions. A drop in net inflows or an increase in redemptions can result from a variety of factors, including overall market conditions and volatility or uncompetitive investment performance. If the level of assets on which we provide investment advisory or investment management services goes down, we expect our fee-based revenue to show a corresponding decline.\nOur largest transaction-based business, the credit rating business, can be severely impacted by volatility in U.S. and international financial markets due to its dependence on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets. Market disruptions and economic slowdowns have in the past negatively impacted, and may in the future negatively impact, the volume of debt securities issued in global capital markets and the demand for credit ratings.\nConditions that reduce issuers\u2019 ability or willingness to issue debt securities, such as market volatility, increasing inflation, declining growth, currency devaluations, or other adverse economic trends, reduce the number and value of debt issuances for which we provide credit ratings services and thereby adversely affect the fees we earn in our credit ratings business. Future debt issuances also could be negatively affected by increases in interest rates, widening credit spreads, regulatory and political developments, growth in the use of alternative sources of credit, and defaults by significant issuers. Our ability to reduce costs in the event of such adverse developments can be negatively impacted by, among other things, our obligations to monitor and maintain outstanding ratings. Declines or other changes in the markets for debt securities may materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur transactional business results may also be hurt by negative trends in Internet advertising sales. Many advertisers have shifted some of their advertising spend to programmatic buying platforms that target users on other sites, which has from time to time had a negative effect on advertising revenue for our website for individual investors, Morningstar.com. The reliance on virtual events as the COVID-19 pandemic restricted large gatherings during 2020 impacted our financial results for our Morningstar-sponsored investor conferences around the world. We are uncertain whether these trends will continue.\nFailing to differentiate our products and services and continuously create innovative, proprietary and insightful financial technology solutions may harm our competitive position and business results.\nOur core competencies are around data and research, technology, and design. Morningstar deploys each of these to create unique intellectual property, products, and solutions that clearly convey complex investment information to investors of all kinds. Morningstar offers a suite of solutions that serve individuals, financial advisors, asset managers, retirement plan providers and sponsors, and institutional investors in the private capital markets. Morningstar also applies its long-term investing philosophy to managing assets for clients. Our customers have access to a wide selection of investment data, fundamental equity research, manager research, credit ratings, private capital markets research, and ESG data and research, directly on Morningstar\u2019s proprietary desktop or web-based software platforms, or through subscriptions, data feeds, and third-party distributors. Our financial technology solutions also allow advisors to serve investors at all stages of the investing process. Morningstar\u2019s managed portfolio offerings help advisors outsource investment selection and asset allocation through proprietary portfolio strategies based on Morningstar\u2019s valuation-driven, fundamentals-based approach to investing. Applying its expertise in asset allocation, investment selection, and portfolio construction, our global investment team creates long-term investment strategies built on Morningstar\u2019s data and ratings. We also help retirement plan sponsors build high-quality savings programs for employees. The breadth and depth of our service offerings set us apart from our competitors, which is a significant competitive advantage.\nIf we fail to continuously innovate and develop new research, methodologies, content or software to meet the needs of our customers, our competitive position and business results may suffer. In addition, our reputation could be harmed if we\u2019re perceived as not moving quickly enough to meet the changing needs of investors or their financial advisors. These changing needs include a greater reliance on goals-based investing, the increased use of asset allocation portfolio models, and a significant emphasis on financial planning. Clients may also delay purchases of our currently offered research tools and software in anticipation of us offering new products or enhanced versions of existing products. Our competitive position and business results may also suffer if other companies are able to successfully introduce innovative, proprietary research tools and software that gain attention from our clients. We believe lower technology costs, the growth of open software platforms, and cloud computing technologies have lowered the barriers to entry for new competitors, making it easier for new players to enter the market. Smaller companies, including startup firms funded by private equity and venture capital, may be able to move more quickly than us to develop data sets, research, tools, and advisor software platforms that gain a wide following.\nIn addition, the value of our products and services may be negatively affected by the increasing amount of information and tools that are available for free, or at low cost, through Internet sources or other low-cost delivery systems, and by the ability of machine learning and other artificial intelligence systems to process and organize large data sets. Regulations, such as the SEC\u2019s requirement that registered investment companies report their fund portfolio holdings publicly on Form N-PORT, may reduce demand for some of our data sets or make them more easily replicable. Although we believe our products and services contain value-added features and functionality that deeply embed them in our customers\u2019 workflows, such developments may over time reduce the demand for, or customers\u2019 willingness to pay for, certain of our products and services.\nIf we fail to introduce innovative, proprietary research tools and frameworks or financial advisor software, we may not generate enough interest from potential clients to win new business. Consolidation within the financial services industry has provided our competitors resources to expand into adjacent business lines, often using our data in innovative ways or focusing on different client types or use cases. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully develop new product features and tools that differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors.\nIn addition, we must make long-term investments and commit significant resources often before knowing whether such investments will result in products or services that satisfy our clients\u2019 needs or generate revenues sufficient to justify such investments. In addition, from time to time, we also incur costs to transition clients to new or enhanced products or services. Such transitions can involve material execution risks and challenges. If we are unable to manage these investments and transitions successfully, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur results could suffer if fee compression within the asset and wealth management sectors continues, or if the financial industry continues to meaningfully consolidate.\nPart of our growth since 1984 can be attributed to favorable industry trends as investors and their financial advisors embraced the need for complete, accurate, and timely research and data on investable securities. A significant portion of our research has historically focused on actively managed, equity-related funds. In 2019, the portion of assets invested in passively managed U.S. equity funds surpassed the assets invested in actively managed U.S. equity funds for the first time. Passively managed portfolios generally charge lower management fees than active strategies and lower management fees are a significant factor in investment recommendations of financial advisors and plan sponsors attempting to fulfill their fiduciary duties. However, the ascendance of passive strategies may affect both the profitability of asset managers, on whose success we in part depend, and the perceived value of our research regarding such strategies. In addition, the change in financial advisor activity away from security selection to goals-based asset allocation and portfolio construction and the increasing use of model portfolios, as well as the growth of online wealth management tools that provide automated, algorithm-based portfolio management advice, sometimes called robo-advice, may further reduce demand for our security-specific data and analyst research. In addition, as fee compression continues to affect recordkeepers, asset managers, and financial advisors, these customers for our software solutions and investment management and retirement solutions may seek price reductions and product enhancements to offset the effects of such compression on their businesses.\nThe growth of the mutual fund industry is also being affected by merger and acquisition activity within the asset management industry and brokerage and custodial distribution platforms, the pruning by some mutual fund and ETF platforms of the number of funds available for purchase, and the continuing impacts of regulation. This consolidation reduces the number of asset managers and platforms offering mutual funds and ETFs, reducing the number of potential customers in our traditional client base and increasing their relative bargaining power. With respect to regulation, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) in the EU, which requires that asset managers pay banks and brokers for investment research, has presented us with new business opportunities, but has also caused some of our clients to adapt their business practices and pricing models significantly to reflect or avoid these new costs, which may adversely affect their demand for our services. Industry consolidation also may reduce demand for our software products that support financial advisers and also gives the combined entities additional pricing power with respect to some of our investment products like Retirement Managed Accounts.\nIn addition, consolidation throughout the financial services industry among custodians, registered investment advisers, discount brokers, and record keepers provides surviving companies scale and resources to expand into adjacent service offerings which may compete with ours. For example, we have seen asset managers roll out model portfolios that compete with our managed portfolio offering. This trend requires us to continually expand and customize our service offerings and ensure that our products remain seamlessly integrated with our customers\u2019 business processes and technology.\nProlonged downturns, sustained volatility in the financial markets, or a lack of investor confidence could reduce investor interest and investment activity and decrease demand for our software, data, and analyst research products. Intermittent volatility that reduces issuance or increased investor interest in other investment vehicles can put negative pressure on our credit ratings and investment management businesses.\nOur acquisitions and other investments may not produce the results we anticipate.\nWe have completed numerous acquisitions over the past 10 years, and we intend to continue to pursue selective acquisitions to support our business strategy. However, there can be no assurance we can identify suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices. In addition, each acquisition presents potential challenges and risks. We may not achieve the growth targets that we established for the acquired business at the time of the acquisition. The process of integration may require more resources than we expected or present challenges that were not foreseen.\nWe may assume unintended liabilities or experience operating difficulties or costs that we did not forecast. We may also fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business, which would make it difficult to follow through on our operating goals for the business. If an acquisition does not generate the results we anticipate, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also have, and intend to continue to make, various investments in companies where we do not have or obtain a controlling interest. Such investments are motivated both by their prospective financial return and the access they give us to certain new technologies, products, business ideas, and management teams. While we obtain various rights in connection with such investments, the future value of such investments is highly dependent on the management skill of the managers of those companies.\nWe expect to continue making acquisitions and establishing investments and joint ventures as part of our long-term business strategy. Acquisitions, investments, and joint ventures involve a number of risks. They can be time-consuming and may divert management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations, particularly if numerous acquisitions are in process at the same time. Financing an acquisition could result in dilution from issuing equity securities, reduce our financial flexibility because of reductions in our cash balance, or result in a weaker balance sheet from incurring debt.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nOur investment management operations may subject us to liability for any losses that result from a breach of our fiduciary duties or a failure to comply with our duties to clients under applicable securities laws.\nThree of our subsidiaries, Morningstar Investment Management LLC, Morningstar Investment Services LLC, and Morningstar Research Services LLC, are registered as investment advisors with the SEC under the Advisers Act. As Registered Investment Advisors, these companies are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Advisers Act. These requirements primarily relate to record-keeping, reporting, and standards of care, as well as general anti-fraud prohibitions. The fiduciary duties of a Registered Investment Adviser to its clients include an obligation of good faith and full and fair disclosure of all facts material to the client\u2019s engagement of the advisor, an obligation to provide investment advice suitable for the particular client, an obligation to have a reasonable, independent basis for investment recommendations, an obligation when directing client brokerage transactions to seek the best execution thereof, and an obligation to vote client proxies in the best interests of the client. As Registered Investment Advisors, these subsidiaries are subject to on-site examination by the SEC.\nIn addition, in cases where these subsidiaries provide investment advisory services to retirement plans and their participants, they may be acting as fiduciaries under ERISA. As fiduciaries under ERISA, they have obligations to act in the best interest of their clients. They also have duties of loyalty and prudence, as well as duties to diversify investments and to follow plan documents to comply with the applicable portions of ERISA.\nOur subsidiaries outside the U.S. that have investment advisory operations are subject to similar requirements.\nWe may face liabilities for actual or claimed breaches of our fiduciary duties, particularly in areas where we provide retirement advice and managed retirement accounts. In some of our retirement contracts, we act as an ERISA fiduciary by, for example, selecting and monitoring a broad range of diversified plan options. We also provide a managed account service for retirement plan participants who elect to have their accounts managed by our programs. Such activities have been the subject of increasing class action litigation in recent years. For example, in 2017, a participant in a pension plan filed a putative class action proceeding against us alleging that we, together with other defendant parties, violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act by allegedly engaging in actions to steer plan participants into high-cost investments that pay unwarranted fees to the defendants. Our motion to dismiss that proceeding was granted, but there can be no assurance that other putative class action proceedings based on the same or other legal theories may not be brought against us in different contexts or, if brought, will be successfully dismissed. We could face substantial liabilities related to our management of assets in our managed retirement accounts.\nWe rely on automated investment technology for our retirement advice and managed retirement accounts services. The Wealth Forecasting Engine is our core advice and managed accounts engine that determines appropriate asset allocations for retirement plan participants and assigns individuals to portfolios. We also rely on automated portfolio construction tools. As these become more interconnected with other product offerings, including the technology of clients and other third parties, the increasing complexity of the technology requires more expertise and efforts to manage and test. Problems could arise if these programs do not work as intended, particularly if we failed to detect program errors over an extended period and are found to be a breach of our fiduciary duty or applicable law.\nWe seek to constantly innovate and improve our retirement services offering, and in doing so, we regularly release new versions of the technology and update our methodology. Additional customer support may be needed to ensure that clients implement the new versions and updates properly and understand the implications for their plan participants. If we make an error, we may be subject to potentially large liabilities for make-whole payments and/or litigation. We cannot quantify the potential size of these liabilities with any level of precision.\nIn addition, we may face other legal liabilities based on other theories of liability relating to various substantive requirements of the Advisers Act and other federal and state securities laws, even in the absence of an actual or claimed breach of fiduciary duty. We could face substantial liabilities related to the investment advisory and management services we provide.\nCompliance failures, regulatory action, or changes in laws applicable to our credit ratings operations, investment advisory, ESG and index businesses could adversely affect our business.\nDBRS Morningstar, our credit ratings business, operates in a highly regulated environment in Canada, the U.S., the U.K., and the EU. The laws and regulations governing credit ratings impose substantial ongoing compliance obligations and costs and subject DBRS Morningstar to regular regulatory examinations and occasional investigations, relating to the company itself or sometimes to the credit ratings industry as a whole. In operating under these laws and regulations, DBRS Morningstar can experience good faith uncertainty over the scope, interpretation, and administration of such laws and regulations. In addition, differences between the laws and rules governing credit rating agencies in Canada, the U.S., the U.K., and the EU can result in inconsistent regulatory requirements that it may not be possible to fully reconcile in a cost-efficient manner for a credit rating agency of DBRS Morningstar's size.\nNew laws, regulations and regulatory implementation guidance may also affect the day-to-day operation of the business of DBRS Morningstar, its customers, and users of its credit ratings, including by imposing new or expanded requirements on such matters as communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, the manner in which DBRS Morningstar\u2019s ratings are developed and communicated, the manner in which customers may use credit ratings, and other aspects of the business model for credit rating agencies. Failures by DBRS Morningstar could lead to fines, settlements, and/or temporary or permanent operating restrictions. Further, many aspects of credit ratings agency policies and practices and their compliance with applicable law, regulations, contracts and license arrangements are not the subject of definitive regulatory guidance or case law.\nOur investment management operations are subject to complex securities laws and other laws in multiple jurisdictions. The activities of our investment advisory operations in the U.S. are subject to provisions of the Advisers Act, ERISA, and, in the case of our advisory relationship with the Morningstar Funds Trust, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Commodity Exchange Act. In addition, Morningstar Investment Services is a broker/dealer registered under the Exchange Act and is subject to the rules of FINRA. If we fail to comply with securities laws and other regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines or other events that could have a negative effect on our business.\nWe also provide investment advisory services in other areas around the world, and our operations are subject to additional regulations in markets outside the U.S. In preparation for the end of the transition period following the U.K.\u2019s exit from the EU, we restructured our European investment management operations. While we have been conditionally granted authorization for our French investment advisory subsidiary to continue to provide investment advisory services to those EU institutional clients previously serviced by our U.K. based investment advisory subsidiary, this process has been time consuming and has resulted in increased costs and duplication of functions. Furthermore, as there has not been an \u201cequivalence\u201d determination in terms of applicable regulations in the U.K. and the EU following Brexit, we anticipate ongoing costs to monitor and comply with potentially diverging legal and regulatory developments in each jurisdiction.\nThe Morningstar Funds Trust, a registered open-end mutual fund for which Morningstar Investment Management acts as investment advisor under an investment management agreement. The independent Board of Trustees of the Morningstar Funds Trust must annually approve the terms of the investment management agreement (including fees) and can terminate the agreement upon 60-days' notice. If we are no longer able to satisfy the Board of Trustees of our effective management of the Morningstar Funds Trust, the Board has authority to lower the fees that we receive or terminate our contract, which could have a material adverse effect on the revenues and net income of our investment advisory services.\nOur Sustainalytics business could be negatively affected by increased regulation of ESG research and data. To date, regulatory activity, principally in the EU, has focused on new ESG disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies, and rules relating to the design, delivery and sale of financial services and products using ESG labels. Sustainalytics as a research and data provider has not been affected directly by this regulation. However, certain European regulators have proposed new legislation that would grant the European securities regulator, ESMA, supervisory powers over ESG data providers. ESG data providers would be required to disclose the sources of their data, their data collection processes, how missing data is estimated, and their data quality controls, among other things. ESG data providers would have to detail their governance and internal controls, their compliance practices for managing conflicts of interest, and their review functions for monitoring methodologies, models and key rating assumptions. The proposed regulation would require consistency of fees to ensure that the provision of sustainability-related products/services are not discriminatory. Such a regulatory regime could impose significant compliance burdens and costs on Sustainalytics and, as with all new regulation, could be subject to ambiguous interpretation that could result in inadvertent noncompliance. Furthermore, as our Sustainalytics business operates globally and we look to integrate ESG factors throughout our products, we may be subject to future regulation in multiple jurisdictions, which may be inconsistent.\nOur index business could be negatively affected by increased regulation of benchmarks generally, which could increase the costs and risks of producing and administering indexes. For example, ESMA has proposed that it be granted the authority to require benchmark administrators to modify their benchmarks. Such regulations may discourage market participants from continuing to use, administer, or contribute to indexes, trigger changes in the rules or methodologies relating indexes, and/or lead to declining demand for indexes.\nThe laws, rules, and regulations, and their interpretations, applicable to our business may change in the future, and we may not be able to comply with these changes without extensive changes to our business practices. In the recent past, the scope and pace of global regulatory change has both increased and involved shorter compliance time frames, which has increased both the risk that we will properly identify and respond to regulatory changes applicable to our operations and the risk that we will implement such changes on a timely and complete basis. Regulations aimed at increasing transparency for investors or providing individuals greater control over their own data may devalue the investments we have made in our data sets or reduce their use cases. In addition, the broad scope of our business operations makes it more difficult to monitor areas that may be subject to regulatory and compliance risk. Developments, such as the National Security Law in Hong Kong which reduce press freedoms could impact the safety of our local employees and ultimately cause us to discontinue operations in that jurisdiction. If we fail to comply with any applicable law, rule, or regulation, we could be fined, sanctioned, or barred from providing certain products and services in the future, which could adversely affect our business.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights, or claims of intellectual property infringement against us, could harm our brand and ability to compete effectively.\nThe steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to safeguard our proprietary information. We rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret rights, as well as contractual protections and technical safeguards, to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information. Despite these efforts, third parties may still attempt to challenge, invalidate, or circumvent our rights or improperly obtain our proprietary information. Further, effective trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we offer our services. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our brand, devalue our proprietary content, and affect our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nFrom time to time, we encounter jurisdictions in which one or more third parties have a pre-existing trademark registration in certain relevant international classes that may prevent us from registering our own marks in those jurisdictions. Our continued ability to use the \u201cMorningstar\u201d name or logo, either on a stand-alone basis or in association with certain products or services, could be compromised in those jurisdictions because of these pre-existing registrations. Similarly, from time to time, we encounter situations in certain jurisdictions where one or more third parties are already using the Morningstar name, either as part of a registered corporate name, a registered domain name, or otherwise. Our ability to effectively market certain products and/or services in those locations could be adversely affected by these pre-existing usages.\nWe have from time to time been subject to claims by third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. Such claims can also be alleged against clients, customers, or distributors of our products or services whom we have agreed to indemnify against third party claims of infringement. The defense of such claims can be costly and consume valuable management time and attention. We may be forced to settle such claims on unfavorable terms, which can include the payment of damages, the entry into royalty or licensing arrangements on commercially unfavorable terms, or the suspension of our ability to offer affected products or services. If litigation were to arise from any such claim, there can be no certainty we would prevail in it. If any of these risks were to materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Information Technology and Security\nWe could face significant reputational and financial consequences relating to cybersecurity and the protection of confidential information, including personal information about individuals.\nOur business requires that we securely collect, process, store, and transmit confidential information, including personal information, relating to our operations, customers, employees, and other third parties. We continuously invest in systems, processes, controls, and other security measures to guard against the risk of improper access to or release of such information. However, these measures do not guarantee absolute security, and improper access to or release of confidential information may still occur through employee error or malfeasance, system error, other inadvertent release, failure to properly purge and protect data, or cyberattack. Furthermore, these security measures are less effective in situations where employees are utilizing personal devices and home networks while working remotely.\nWe may suffer malicious attacks by individuals or groups (including those sponsored by nation-states, terrorist organizations, or global corporations seeking to illicitly obtain technology or other intellectual property) seeking to attack our products and services or penetrate our network infrastructure to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, or to launch or coordinate distributed denial of service attacks. While we have dedicated resources responsible for maintaining appropriate levels of cybersecurity and implemented systems and processes intended to help identify cyberattacks and protect and remediate our network infrastructure, these attacks have become increasingly frequent, sophisticated, and difficult to detect. Our measures may not be adequate for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to circumvention of security systems, denial of service attacks or other cyberattacks, hacking, \u201cphishing\u201d attacks, computer viruses, ransomware or malware, employee or insider error, employee or vendor malfeasance, social engineering, physical breaches or other malicious actions.\nWe may also be impacted by a cyberattack targeting one of our vendors or within our technology supply chain or infrastructure. Recent well-publicized security breaches at government agencies and other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyberattacks and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity requirements, including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of customers, vendors, and service providers. Our information technology systems interact with those of customers, vendors, and service providers and collect an increasing amount of data as we expand our product and service offerings, for example in financial planning. Our contracts with those parties typically require them to implement and maintain adequate security controls, but we may not have the ability to effectively monitor the security measures of all our customers, vendors, and service providers. These risks may be heightened in connection with employees working from remote work environments occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic as our dependency on certain service providers, such as video conferencing and web conferencing services, has significantly increased. In a number of cases, our customers build and host their own web applications and access our solutions through our APIs. In these cases, additional risks reside in the customer\u2019s system with respect to security and preventive controls. As a result, inadequacies of our customers\u2019 security technologies and practices may only be detected after a security breach has occurred.\nAny failure to safeguard confidential information or any material cybersecurity failures or incidents in our systems (or the systems of a customer, vendor, or service provider which stores or processes confidential information for which we are responsible) could cause us to experience reputational harm, loss of customers, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, or financial losses and increased expenses related to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such material failures or incidents.\nIn addition to the risks above related to general confidential information, we may also be subject to specific obligations relating to personal information and personal financial information. Our products and websites in certain cases collect, store, process, and transmit personal information about an individual, including personally identifiable information and personal financial information such as portfolio holdings, account numbers, and credit card information. Our business also operates across national borders and routinely moves personal information from one jurisdiction to another. We and our customers are often subject to federal, state, and foreign laws relating to privacy, cybersecurity, and data protection. The scope of the laws that may be applicable is often uncertain and may be inconsistent with laws of other jurisdictions. Consequently, our business is subject to a variety of continuously evolving and possibly conflicting regulations and customer requirements. Our compliance with these changing and increasingly burdensome regulations and requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices which may impact financial results. If we fail to comply with these regulations or requirements, we may be exposed to litigation expenses and possible significant liability, fees, or fines. For example, in the EU, noncompliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenues.\nAdditionally, we make disclosures and statements regarding our use of personal information through our privacy policies and statements covering our products and websites as required by privacy or data protection regulation. One of Morningstar\u2019s core strengths is the ability to collect data and enrich it with data from another part of the business to provide valuable information and insights to investors. As data is accessible across our products, consistent data privacy practices and disclosure becomes more important and challenging. Failure to comply with our public statements or to adequately disclose our privacy or data protection practices could result in costly investigations by governmental authorities, litigation, and fines as well as reputational damage and customer loss.\nWe also from time to time acquire other companies that collect and process personal information. While we perform extensive due diligence on the technology systems and practices of these companies, there can be no assurance that such companies have not suffered data breaches or system intrusions prior to or continuing after our acquisition for which we may be liable. Acquired businesses may not have invested as heavily in such security measures or data privacy controls and they introduce additional cybersecurity and data privacy risk as their systems are integrated with ours.\nWhile we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity and data protection risks, such coverage may not be sufficient to cover all or the majority of the costs, losses, or types of claims. Our insurance coverage would not extend to any reputational damage, loss of customers, or required improvements to our systems.\nFailing to respond to technological change, keep pace with new technology developments, or adopt a successful technology strategy may negatively affect our competitive position and business results.\nWe believe the technology landscape has been changing at an accelerating rate over the past several years. Changes in technology are fundamentally changing the ways investors, issuers and other market participants access data and content. Examples include the shift from local network computing to cloud-based systems, the proliferation of wireless mobile devices, rapid acceleration in the use of social media platforms, the dissemination of data through application programming interfaces that permit real-time updating rather than raw data feeds, and the proliferation of machine learning and other artificial intelligence technologies. As our customers further automate their business processes, their need for our products may change and the technological flexibility and interoperability of our systems may become more important. In addition, there has been an increasing focus on technology not merely supplying additional tools for users, but also offering solutions to specific client problems.\nOur software development process is based on frequently rolling out new features so that we can quickly incorporate user feedback. While some changes in technology may offer opportunities for Morningstar, we cannot guarantee that we will successfully adapt our product offerings to meet evolving customer needs or that the transition to such new offerings will be seamless. If we fail to develop and implement new technology rapidly enough, we may sacrifice new business opportunities or renewals from existing customers. We may also incur additional operating expense if major software projects take longer than anticipated or if clients decline to migrate to new systems and we must support two platforms over an extended period of time. Our technology is also heavily dependent on the quality and comprehensiveness of our data and our ability to successfully build analytics, research, and other intellectual property around that data. We are investing significant resources in consolidating our various data assets and improving their usability and deliverability across our platform of products. Our competitive position and business results may suffer if we fail to develop new technologies to meet client demands, if our execution speed is too slow, if we adopt a technology strategy that doesn't align with changes in the market, or if we fail to realize the value and potential of our data assets.\nFinally, we rely on technology for our own internal business operations and must continually evaluate these tools to ensure they are sufficient for our expanding needs. If we are unable to develop or purchase technology to support our finance, legal, compliance, audit, human resources, and other corporate teams, these functions may operate inefficiently, at higher cost, or with greater risks than is necessary.\nWe could face liability for the information and data we collect, store, use, create, and distribute or the reports and other documents we publish or that are produced by our software products.\nWe may be subject to claims for securities law violations, defamation (including libel and slander), negligence, or other claims relating to the information we publish, including our research and credit ratings. For example, investors may take legal action against us if they rely on published information that contains an error, or a company may claim that we have made a defamatory statement about it or its employees. In addition, in our credit ratings business, we have access to significant amounts of material nonpublic information on issuers of securities, the inadvertent disclosure of which, or the misappropriation by employees or others, could expose us to various liabilities under securities and other laws.\nSome of our products support the investment processes or the client account reporting practices and other activities of our clients who manage significant assets of other parties. Use of our products as part of such activities creates the risk that clients, or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients, may pursue claims against us for losses that may have some connection to our products, and we may be subject to investigation of our products and their use by government regulators who regulate the business of our clients. In the case of software products, even though most of our contracts for such products contain limitations of our liability in such cases, we may be required to make such clients or their customers whole for any losses in order to maintain our business relationships. We could also be subject to claims based on the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites.\nWe rely on a variety of outside parties as the original sources for the information we use in our published data. These sources include securities exchanges, fund companies, hedge funds, transfer agents, issuers, and other data providers. We also incorporate data from a variety of third-party sources for many of our products including PitchBook. Accordingly, in addition to possible exposure for publishing incorrect information that results directly from our own errors, we could face liability based on inaccurate data provided to us by others. For example, our Sustainalytics business is reliant on self-reported information for some of its issuer focused ESG ratings and analysis. We also face the risk that a significant data source terminates its distribution of the data to us, which could impact our products, research, or other calculations that utilize that information.\nWe could be subject to claims by providers of data and information we compile from websites and other sources that we have improperly obtained that data in violation of the source\u2019s copyrights or terms of use. We could also be subject to claims from third parties, such as securities exchanges from which we license and redistribute data and information, that we have used or redistributed the data or information in ways not permitted by our license rights or that we have inadequately permissioned our clients to use such data. The agreements with such exchanges and other data providers give them extensive data use audit rights, and such audits can be expensive and time consuming and potentially result in substantial fines. We could also be subject to claims from regulators that we have mishandled nonpublic data and information, in particular in our credit ratings business. These regulatory bodies have audit rights regarding our data use which could have similar adverse consequences in terms of time, expense, or fines. Defending claims based on the information we publish could be expensive and time-consuming and could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFinally, our global business regularly seeks to optimize our data storage in order to improve information accuracy and streamline the technology, which supports our business operations. These efforts are constrained by data privacy legislation, such as GDPR, which defines standards for storage, transfer, and use of certain personal information from and about individuals. Legislation aimed at protecting material nonpublic information or mitigating potential conflicts of interest further define how certain information can be accessed and retained which may result in less efficient or higher cost technological processes and infrastructure.\nAn outage of our database, technology-based products and services or network facilities could result in reduced revenue and the loss of customers, and our movement of parts of our technological and data infrastructure to the public cloud and other outsourced providers could expose us to various third party provider risks.\nThe success of our business depends upon our ability to deliver time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information that meets client expectations and contractual requirements. We rely extensively on our computer systems, database storage facilities, and other network infrastructure, which is located across multiple facilities in the U.S. and globally. Our mission-critical databases and networks are complex and interdependent, which increases the risk of failure. As we grow through acquisitions, the newly acquired businesses may not have invested in technological infrastructure and disaster recovery to the same extent as we have. As their systems are integrated into ours, a vulnerability could be introduced, which could impact our platforms across the company. Problems in our network systems may lead to cascading effects involving product downtime, overloading of third-party data centers, and other issues that may affect our clients. Many of our client contracts contain service-level agreements that require us to meet certain obligations for delivering time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information. We may not be able to meet these obligations in the event of failure or downtime in our information systems.\nOur operations and those of our suppliers and customers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, wars, computer viruses, and other events beyond our control. Our database and network facilities may also be vulnerable to external attacks that misappropriate our data, corrupt our databases, or limit access to our information systems. To defend against these threats, we implement a series of controls focusing on both prevention and detection, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, automated scanning and testing, server hardening, antivirus software, training, and patch management. We make significant investments in servers, storage, and other network infrastructure to prevent incidents of network failure and downtime, but we cannot guarantee that these efforts will work as planned.\nMost of our products and services depend heavily on our electronic delivery systems and the Internet, although we are shifting the storage of our data and delivery of several of our products and services to cloud-based delivery systems. We rely on cloud providers and other vendors to maintain, service, and improve our technological infrastructure, which underpins and protects our data, research, and other products and services. In addition, in the remote work environments occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, the daily activities and productivity of our work force is now closely tied to key vendors, such as video conferencing services, consistently delivering their services without material disruption. Our ability to deliver information using the Internet and to operate in a remote working environment may be impaired because of infrastructure failures, service outages at third-party Internet providers, malicious attacks, or other factors. If disruptions, failures, or slowdowns of these electronic delivery systems or the Internet occur, our ability to distribute our products and services effectively and to serve our customers may be impaired.\nWe maintain off-site backup facilities for our data, but we cannot guarantee that these facilities will operate as expected during an interruption that affects our primary facility. There may be single points of failure that affect our core databases, data transfer interfaces, or storage area networks. We may not be able to fully recover data or information lost during a database or network facility outage. Any losses, service disruption, or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic may have material and adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, the nature and extent of which continue to be uncertain and unpredictable.\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental and societal responses to it worldwide have the potential to materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations in ways that continue to be uncertain and unpredictable. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant public health concerns, as well as significant volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption in most countries in which we operate. While we have taken numerous steps to respond to this changing environment, there can be no assurance that such steps will be successful or that our business, financial condition, and results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected by the consequences of the pandemic.\nThroughout 2020, we saw fluctuations of government-mandated COVID-19-related restrictions on the physical movement and gathering of people in certain geographies, dependent upon the local extent and severity of COVID-19 infections and other factors. Those fluctuations have continued into 2021 as certain governments, such as the United Kingdom, have again imposed comprehensive lockdowns. Our approach to preventative and protective actions has remained similarly flexible and, although a significant portion of our workforce continues to work from remote work environments, we have been able to bring back some employees to office locations on a volunteer-only basis. Many of our customers, vendors, and data suppliers continue to operate under similar arrangements, which may interfere with attendance or productivity. While our business continuity plans have permitted remote working arrangements without material interruption, prolonged periods of virtual collaboration may have an impact on innovation, productivity, and culture over time. Our management is focused on mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, which has required and may continue to require a substantial investment of their time and may delay other strategic activities.\nIn the longer term, the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world\u2019s economies and financial markets may be significant, with unpredictable effects on the overall demand and pricing environment for our products and services. While 2020 saw periods of growth in many financial markets and our business showed resiliency, uncertainty around the continuing extent and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the willingness of governments and central banks to continue fiscal and monetary stimulus, and national and global political conditions may undermine or reverse such growth. If that turns out to be the case, our asset management businesses could be affected by declines in assets under management and advisement resulting from any prolonged downturn in financial markets and a concomitant decline of broad-based investment activity, while our credit ratings business could suffer from a decline in new issuance activity resulting from a decline in the availability of credit. The financial performance of our customers, including those of our license businesses, could materially deteriorate, which could result in lower demand, cancellations, price reductions, or delays in implementation for our products and services. The uncertainty surrounding the duration and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the countries in which we operate could impede our business planning and coordination. In addition, the availability of credit could become constrained even to financially strong companies.\nOur business, products and facilities are at risk of a number of material disruptive events which our operational risk management and business continuity programs may not be adequate to address.\nOur business and major products are dependent on our ability to provide data, software applications, and other products and services on a current and time-sensitive basis. We are at risk of disruptions from numerous factors, including pandemic, violent incident, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications and Internet failures, civil unrest, cybersecurity attacks and breaches, and other events beyond our reasonable control. We are also subject to potential shortcomings in our own business resilience practices, such as failures to fully understand dependencies between different business processes across the locations in which they are performed, inadequate vendor risk assessment and management processes and critical vendor dependencies, concentration of certain critical activities in areas of geopolitical risk, concentration of certain skills and know-how with small groups of key employees, and possibly ineffective location recovery strategies in the event of a location disruption. We continue to develop processes to support our employees working remotely, but we remain exposed to disruptive events at our significant office locations.\nOur corporate headquarters in Chicago, Illinois is the home office for a significant number of our employees including most of our executive leadership team, as well as substantial numbers of employees involved in the delivery of most of our major products and services. If a pandemic, natural disaster, a violent incident, or another dangerous emergency significantly impacted the safety or communication connectivity of people living in and around Chicago, we might not be able to continue business operations at an acceptable level that would meet all our legal and contractual commitments. Civil unrest in downtown Chicago caused us to close our headquarters office several times during 2020, disrupting workflow for local employees and requiring agility from our facilities and other teams focused on ensuring the safety and security of our business operations.\nWe also have a substantial number of employees working in our data and technology development center in Shenzhen, China. We rely on these employees to maintain and update our mutual fund database and work on other projects. Because China has a restrictive government under centralized control and the relationship between the U.S. and China is experiencing a period of increased political, military, trade, and other commercial tensions, our operations are subject to political and regulatory risk, which is inherently unpredictable. Laws and regulations relating to data privacy, security, protection of intellectual property rights, and acceptable telecommunication infrastructure in China, as well as the enforcement environment for such laws and regulations, are in certain cases uncertain and evolving. In addition, this facility is subject from time to time to extreme weather events, which has limited employees' access to our offices. The concentration of certain types of development and data work carried out at this facility also involves operational risks for parts of our network infrastructure. While we have short-term backup plans in place, it would be difficult for us to maintain and update our mutual fund database if we were unable to maintain the continuity of our Shenzhen operations for an extended period of time. Any difficulties that we face in continuing to operate our development center in China may harm our business and have a negative impact on the products and services we provide.\nOur data collection, technology, and operational center in Mumbai, India is also a significant location with many of our employees. These employees maintain and update our equity database and PitchBook's data and research operations, and provide shared services to many of our operations. This location is subject to extreme weather events and political unrest, including public protests that can disrupt transportation and make it difficult for employees to commute to and from work. The electrical infrastructure of Mumbai is also subject to more frequent interruptions than are experienced at our other major facilities. In addition, Mumbai has experienced and may in the future experience terrorist attacks. While we have short-term backup plans in place to address such business continuity issues, it would be challenging for us to maintain and update our equity database or continue to provide certain shared services to our worldwide operations if we were unable to maintain the continuity of our Mumbai operations for an extended period of time.\nWe engage third party vendors in several locations, including Colombia, India, and Ukraine, which provide contract labor in support of our operations. Each of these locations has experienced various types of geopolitical risks and the labor force at those locations may be subject to instructions from the third party vendors in the case of a disruptive event that might need to take into consideration priorities different from our own. Any extended disruptions to our contract operations in these locations would make it difficult for us to meet our operating goals.\nOur future success depends on our ability to recruit, develop, and retain qualified employees.\nThe development, maintenance, and support of our products and services are dependent upon the knowledge, skills, experience, and abilities of our employees. Accordingly, we believe the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executives and other key employees. We experience competition for analysts, technology experts, data and software engineers, and other employees from other companies and organizations. Competition for these employees is intense, and we may not be able to retain our existing employees or be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future. In addition, we are exposed to overall rising wage scales in the employment markets in which some of our facilities are located, such as our development center in China, which negatively affects our ability to hire personnel generally without significantly increasing our compensation costs. In China, we believe our ability to hire qualified personnel is also being negatively impacted by the preference of job candidates to work for Chinese companies, as opposed to multinationals, in a period of increasing international tensions.\nOur future success also depends on the continued service of our executive officers, including Joe Mansueto, our Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board and largest shareholder, and Kunal Kapoor, our Chief Executive Officer. The loss of Mansueto, Kapoor, or other executive officers could hurt our business, operating results, or financial condition. We do not have employment agreements, noncompete agreements, or life insurance policies in place with any of our executive officers. They may leave us and work for our competitors or start their own competing businesses.\nOur operations outside of the U.S. involve additional challenges that we may not be able to meet.\nOur operations outside of the U.S. constitute a significant portion of our consolidated revenue. There are risks inherent in doing business outside the U.S., including challenges in reaching new markets because of established competitors and limited brand recognition; difficulties in staffing, managing, and integrating non-U.S. operations; difficulties in coordinating and sharing information globally; differences in laws and policies from country to country, including in relation to employment terms and conditions; exposure to varying legal standards, including intellectual property protection laws; potential tax exposure related to transfer pricing and other issues; heightened risk of fraud and noncompliance in some jurisdictions; and currency exchange rates and exchange controls.\nIn addition, new risks have arisen from the assertion by various national governments of greater control over the movements of people and information across national borders. For example, changes to immigration policy in the U.K. as a result of Brexit and in the U.S. as a result of continued restrictive immigration enforcement could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain talent from other countries. In addition, China\u2019s government has backed various measures that could compromise the privacy and security of our proprietary information or information concerning our customers, including a ban on nonstate sanctioned virtual private networks and requirements that multinational firms acquire and use equipment from Chinese telecom suppliers, while recent court decisions in the EU have raised questions about the ability of multinational companies to process personally identifiable information of EU residents outside of the EU. These risks could hamper our ability to expand around the world, which may hurt our financial performance and ability to grow.\nWe don't engage in currency hedging or have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk. Our reported revenue could suffer if certain foreign currencies decline relative to the U.S. dollar, although the impact on operating income may be offset by an opposing currency impact on locally based operating expense.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility. Our variable rate indebtedness could subject us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nFor an overview of our current outstanding indebtedness, refer to Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Liquidity and Capital Resources below. While our business has historically generated strong cash flow and interest rates on corporate indebtedness are at historically low levels, we cannot provide assurance that we will generate and maintain cash flows sufficient to permit us to service our indebtedness. Our ability to make payments on indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate and access cash in the future, which, in turn, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we cannot refinance or otherwise pay our obligations as they mature and fund our liquidity needs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and ability to compete in our industry could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, a portion of our long-term indebtedness currently bears interest at fluctuating interest rates based on the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) for deposits of U.S. dollars. During 2017, the U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021, though certain USD LIBOR tenors are now expected to be published through mid-2023. It appears as though Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is emerging as the preferred alternative to US Dollar LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing overnight collateralized by US Treasury securities. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes on our borrowing costs over time or the availability to us of credit.\nFurthermore, the terms of our debt agreements include restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, our and our subsidiaries\u2019 financial flexibility. If we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements, there could be a default that, in some cases, if continuing, could result in the accelerated payment of our debt obligations or the termination of borrowing commitments on the part of the lenders under our Credit Agreement. Refer to Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources for a description of the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.\nControl by a principal shareholder could adversely affect our other shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Joe Mansueto, our Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board, owned approximately 45.5% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, he has the practical ability to control substantially all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of our assets. This concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control, impede a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving Morningstar, discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company, or result in actions that may be opposed by other shareholders.\nFluctuations in our operating results may negatively affect our stock price.\nWe believe our business has relatively large fixed costs and low variable costs, which magnify the impact of revenue fluctuations on our operating results. As a result, a decline in our revenue may lead to a larger decline in operating income. In addition, because we manage our business with a long-term perspective, we generally don\u2019t make significant adjustments to our strategy or cost structure in response to short-term factors. As a result, our operating results may suffer in the short term. In addition, we do not provide earnings guidance or hold one-on-one meetings with institutional investors and research analysts. Because of this policy and limited analyst coverage on our stock, our stock price may not always reflect the intrinsic value of our business and assets. If our operating results or other operating metrics fail to meet the expectations of outside research analysts and investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nThe future sale of shares of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price.\nIf our significant shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could fall. A significant reduction in ownership by Joe Mansueto or any other large shareholder could cause the market price of our common stock to fall. Our directors and officers may adopt written plans, known as Rule 10b5-1 plans, in which they may contract with a broker to sell shares on a periodic basis. In addition, the average daily trading volume in our stock is relatively low. The lack of trading activity in our stock may lead to greater fluctuations in our stock price. Low trading volume may also make it difficult for shareholders to make transactions in a timely fashion.", "PERMNO": 90708, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "MORN"}
