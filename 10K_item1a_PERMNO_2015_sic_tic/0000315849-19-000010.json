RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Corporation\u2019s common stock and the Corporation\u2019s financial results are subject to a number of risks. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those generally affecting the industry in which the Corporation operates and risks that management currently deems immaterial, may arise or become material in the future and affect the Corporation\u2019s business.\nAs a bank holding company, adverse conditions in the general business or economic environment could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operation.\nWeaknesses or adverse changes in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the markets in which the Corporation operates could adversely impact our business, including causing one or more of the following negative developments:\n\u00b7 a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Corporation;\n\u00b7 a decrease in the value of the Corporation\u2019s loans secured by consumer or commercial real estate;\n\u00b7 an impairment of the Corporation\u2019s assets, such as its intangible assets, goodwill, or deferred tax\nassets; or\n\u00b7 an increase in the number of customers or other counterparties who default on their loans or other\nobligations to the Corporation, which could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net\ncharge-offs and provision for loan losses.\nFor example, if the Corporation is unable to continue to generate, or demonstrate that it can continue to generate, sufficient taxable income in the near future, then it may not be able to fully realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets. Such a development, or one or more other negative developments resulting from adverse conditions in the general business or economic environment, some of which are described above, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation\u2019s ability to raise capital could be limited, affect its liquidity, and could be dilutive to existing shareholders.\nThe Corporation\u2019s ability to raise capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside of our control, and on the Corporation\u2019s financial performance. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that the Corporation will be able to borrow funds or successfully raise additional capital at all or on terms that are favorable or otherwise not dilutive to existing shareholders.\nCapital resources and liquidity are essential to the Corporation\u2019s businesses and it relies on external sources to finance a significant portion of its operations.\nLiquidity is essential to the Corporation\u2019s businesses. We depend on access to a variety of sources of funding to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our customers. Sources of funding available to us, and upon which we rely as regular components of our liquidity and funding management strategy, include traditional and brokered deposits, inter-bank borrowings, Federal Funds purchased, repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. We may also raise funds from time to time in the form of either short-or long-term borrowings or equity issuances. The Corporation\u2019s capital resources and liquidity could be negatively impacted by disruptions in its ability to access these sources of funding. The cost of brokered and other out-of-market deposits and potential future regulatory limits on the interest rate we pay for brokered deposits could make them unattractive sources of funding. Further, factors that we cannot control, such as disruption of the financial markets or negative views about the financial services industry generally, could impair our ability to access sources of funds. Other financial institutions may be unwilling to extend credit to banks because of concerns about the banking industry and the economy generally and there may not be a viable market for raising short or long-term debt or equity capital. In addition, our ability to raise funding could be impaired if lenders develop a negative perception of our long-term or short-term financial prospects. Such negative perceptions could be developed if the Corporation is downgraded or put on (or remains on) negative watch by the rating agencies, suffers a decline in the level of its business activity or regulatory authorities take significant action against it, among other reasons.\nAmong other things, if we fail to remain \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for bank regulatory purposes, because we do not qualify under the minimum capital standards or the FDIC otherwise downgrades our capital category, it could affect customer confidence, our ability to grow, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on common stock, and our ability to make acquisitions, and we would not be able to accept brokered deposits without prior FDIC approval. To be \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d, a bank must generally maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 5%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% and total risk-based capital ratio of 10%. In addition, our regulators may require us to maintain higher capital levels. Our failure to remain \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d or to maintain any higher capital requirements imposed on us could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the Corporation is unable to raise funding using the methods described above, it would likely need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets to meet maturing liabilities. The Corporation may be unable to sell some of its assets, or it may have to sell assets at a discount from market value, either of which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and depends on subsidiary service fees and dividends from the Bank to fund its payment of dividends to its shareholders and of interest and principal on its outstanding debt. The Bank is also subject to other laws that authorize regulatory authorities to prohibit or reduce the flow of funds from the Bank to the Corporation. Any inability of the Corporation to pay its obligations, or need to defer the payment of any such obligations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and the value of our common stock.\nThe Corporation\u2019s construction and land development loans are subject to unique risks that could adversely affect earnings.\nThe Corporation\u2019s construction and land development loan portfolio was $24.9 million at December 31, 2018, comprising 6.6% of total loans. Construction and land development loans are often riskier than home equity loans or residential mortgage loans to individuals. In the event of a general economic slowdown, they would represent higher risk due to slower sales and reduced cash flow that could impact the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay on a timely basis. As a result, these loans could represent higher risk due to slower sales and reduced cash flow that affect the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay on a timely basis which could result in a sharp increase in our total net charge-offs and require us to significantly increase our allowance for loan losses, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nRecent performance may not be indicative of future performance.\nVarious factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations, competition and the ability to find and retain talented people, may impede the Corporation\u2019s ability to remain profitable.\nDeterioration in asset quality could have an adverse impact on the Corporation.\nA significant source of risk for the Corporation arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans. With respect to secured loans, the collateral securing the repayment of these loans includes a wide variety of diverse real and personal property that may be affected by changes in prevailing economic, environmental and other conditions, including declines in the value of real estate, changes in interest rates, changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, environmental contamination and other external events. In addition, decreases in real estate property values due to the nature of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio, over 75% of which is secured by real estate, could affect the ability of customers to repay their loans. The Bank\u2019s loan policies and procedures may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nChanges in prevailing interest rates may negatively affect the results of operations of the Corporation and the value of its assets.\nThe Corporation\u2019s earnings depend largely on the relationship between the yield on earning assets, primarily loans and investments, and the cost of funds, primarily deposits and borrowings. This relationship, known as the interest rate spread, is subject to fluctuation and is affected by economic and competitive factors which influence interest rates, the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the level of nonperforming assets. Fluctuations in interest rates affect the demand of customers for the Corporation\u2019s products and services. In addition, interest-bearing liabilities may re-price or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than interest-earning assets. Significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nChanges in the level of interest rates may also negatively affect the value of the Corporation\u2019s assets and its ability to realize book value from the sale of those assets, all of which ultimately affect earnings.\nThe Corporation\u2019s reported financial results depend on the accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation, the application of which requires significant assumptions, estimates and judgments.\nThe Corporation\u2019s accounting and reporting policies are fundamental to the methods by which we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. The Corporation\u2019s management must make significant assumptions and estimates and exercise significant judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting and reporting policies so they comply with GAAP and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select a policy from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, which may result in the Corporation reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nIf the Corporation\u2019s allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, earnings would decrease.\nThe Bank\u2019s loan customers may not repay their loans according to their terms and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to assure repayment. The Bank may experience significant loan losses which would have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s operating results. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. The Corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses in an attempt to cover any loan losses inherent in the portfolio. In determining the size of the allowance, management relies on an analysis of the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and types of loans, trends in classification, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, national and local economic conditions and other pertinent information. As a result of these considerations, the Corporation has from time to time increased its allowance for loan losses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Corporation recorded an allowance for possible loan losses of $3.43 million, compared with $3.04 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. If these assumptions are incorrect, the allowance may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in the loan portfolio.\nThe Corporation may be subject to losses due to fraudulent and negligent conduct of the Bank\u2019s loan customers, third party service providers and employees.\nWhen the Bank makes loans to individuals or entities, they rely upon information supplied by borrowers and other third parties, including information contained in the applicant\u2019s loan application, property appraisal reports, title information and the borrower\u2019s net worth, liquidity and cash flow information. While they attempt to verify information provided through available sources, they cannot be certain all such information is correct or complete. The Bank\u2019s reliance on incorrect or incomplete information could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s profitability or financial condition.\nWe rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections and network access. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor's ability to serve us. Furthermore, our vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations.\nTechnology difficulties or failures or cyber security breaches of our network security could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation.\nThe Corporation depends upon data processing, software, and communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks. The computer platforms and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen hardware and cyber security issues. The Corporation cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to cyber-attack or other technological difficulties or failures. The Corporation relies on the services of a variety of vendors to meet its data processing and communication needs. If information security is breached or other technology difficulties or failures occur, information may be lost or misappropriated, services and operations may be interrupted and the Corporation could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customers and expose us to claims from customers. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Although we have security measures designed to mitigate the possibility of break-ins, breaches and other disruptive problems, including firewalls and penetration testing, there can be no assurance that such security measures will be effective in preventing such problems.\nThe Corporation\u2019s business is subject to the success of the local economies and real estate markets in which it operates.\nThe Corporation\u2019s banking operations are located in southwest Georgia. Because of the geographic concentration of its operations, the Corporation\u2019s success depends largely upon economic conditions in this area, which include volatility in the agricultural market, influx and outflow of major employers in the area, and minimal population growth throughout the region. Deterioration in economic conditions in the communities in which the Corporation operates could adversely affect the quality of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio and the demand for its products and services, and accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The Corporation is less able than a larger institution to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of more diverse economies.\nThe Corporation may face risks with respect to its ability to execute its business strategy.\nThe financial performance and profitability of the Corporation will depend on its ability to execute its strategic plan and manage its future growth. Moreover, the Corporation\u2019s future performance is subject to a number of factors beyond its control, including pending and future federal and state banking legislation, regulatory changes, unforeseen litigation outcomes, inflation, lending and deposit rate changes, interest rate fluctuations, increased competition and economic conditions. Accordingly, these issues could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe Corporation depends on its key personnel, and the loss of any of them could adversely affect the Corporation.\nThe Corporation\u2019s success depends to a significant extent on the management skills of its existing executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with the Corporation for many years. The loss or unavailability of any of its key personnel, including DeWitt Drew, President and Chief Executive Officer; Donna S. Lott, Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer`; Jeffery E. Hanson, Executive Vice President and Chief Banking Officer; Danny E. Singley, Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer; and Karen T. Boyd, Senior Vice President & Treasurer, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations or liquidity.\nCompetition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect the Corporation.\nThe banking business is highly competitive, and the Corporation experiences competition in its markets from other depository institutions and other financial service organizations, including brokers, finance companies, financial technology companies, mutual funds, savings and loan associations, credit unions and certain governmental agencies. The Corporation competes with these other financial institutions in attracting deposits and in making loans. Many of its competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions that are able to operate profitably with a narrower net interest margin and have a more diverse revenue base. The Corporation may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of its smaller size, lack of geographic diversification and inability to spread costs across broader markets. There can be no assurance that the Corporation will be able to compete effectively in its markets. Furthermore, developments increasing the nature or level of competition could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nIn addition, technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods. For example, consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology, or we may experience operational challenges when implementing new technology.\nThe financial services industry is changing rapidly, and to remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products, services and technologies. In addition to better serving our customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, at least in part, upon our ability to respond to future technological changes and the ability to address the needs of our customers. We address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations as we continue to grow and expand our products and service offerings. We may experience operational challenges as we implement these new technology enhancements or products, which could result in our not fully realizing the anticipated benefits from such new technology or require us to incur significant costs to remedy any such challenges in a timely manner. In addition, complications during a conversion of our core technology platform or implementation or upgrade of any software could negatively impact the experiences or satisfaction of our customers, which could cause those customers to terminate their relationship with us or reduce the amount of business that they do with us, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMany of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Third parties upon which we rely for our technology needs may not be able to cost-effectively develop systems that will enable us to keep pace with such developments. As a result, our competitors may be able to offer additional or superior products compared to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. We may lose customers seeking new technology-driven products and services to the extent we are unable to provide such products and services. The inability to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements is uncertain.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules established a common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement of 4.5%, a higher minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets requirement of 6% and Total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%. In addition, to be considered \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d, the rules include a common equity Tier 1 capital requirement of 6.5% or greater and a higher Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets requirement of 8% or greater. Moreover, the rules limit a banking organization\u2019s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if such banking organization does not hold a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d consisting of a 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital in addition to the 4.5% minimum common equity Tier 1 requirement and the other amounts necessary to meet the minimum risk-based capital requirements.\nThe application of the more stringent capital requirements described above could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital, and result in additional regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in us modifying our business strategy and could restrict dividends.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, USA Patriot Act of 2001 and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the Treasury to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal bank regulatory agencies, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. Federal bank regulatory agencies and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our income tax provision.\nWe compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any change in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations, any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments and results of operations. In addition, changes in enacted tax laws, such as adoption of a lower income tax rate in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, could impact our ability to obtain the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets.\nThe Tax Act may have negative effects on our financial performance. For example, the Tax Act enacted limitations on certain deductions which will partially offset the anticipated increase in net earnings from a lower tax rate. In addition, as a result of the lower corporate tax rate, we are required under GAAP to record a tax expense due to remeasurement in the fourth quarter of 2017 with respect to our deferred tax asset amounting to $419 thousand. The impact of the Tax Act may differ from the foregoing, possibly materially, due to changes in interpretations or in assumptions that we have made, guidance or regulations that may be promulgated, and other actions that we may take as a result of the Tax Act. Similarly, the Bank\u2019s customers are likely to experience varying effects from both the individual and business tax provisions of the Tax Act and such effects, whether positive or negative, may have a corresponding impact on our business and the economy as a whole.\nChanges in monetary policy, laws and regulations or failures to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely affect the Corporation.\nFederal monetary policy, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve, significantly affects credit conditions for the Corporation, and any unfavorable change in these conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Further, the Corporation and the banking industry are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations. The restrictions imposed by such laws and regulations limit the manner in which the Corporation conducts its banking business, undertakes new investments and activities and obtains financing. These regulations are designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not to benefit holders of the Corporation\u2019s securities. Financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation in recent years and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future, none of which is in the control of the Corporation. Significant new laws or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. See Part I, Item 1, \u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d\nIn 2017, both chambers of Congress proposed comprehensive financial regulatory reform bills that would amend the Dodd-Frank Act and that could affect the banking industry as a whole, including our business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In May 2018, certain provisions of these bills were signed into law as part of the Economic Growth Act and repealed or modified significant portions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Specifically, the Economic Growth Act delayed implementation of rules related to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, reformed and simplified certain Volcker Rule requirements, and raised the threshold for applying enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $50 billion to those with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $250 billion. While recent federal legislation, including the Economic Growth Act, has scaled back portions of the Dodd-Frank Act, uncertainty about the timing and scope of such changes, as well as the cost of complying with a new regulatory regime, remains and enactment of any other regulatory relief is uncertain and none of which may lead to a meaningful reduction of our regulatory burden and attendant costs. See Part I, Item 1, \u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d\nFederal and state regulators have the ability to impose or request that we consent to substantial sanctions, restrictions and requirements on the Bank if they determine, upon examination or otherwise, violations of laws, rules or regulations with which we or the Bank must comply, or weaknesses or failures with respect to general standards of safety and soundness. Such enforcement may be formal or informal and can include directors\u2019 resolutions, memoranda of understanding, cease and desist or consent orders, civil money penalties and termination of deposit insurance and bank closures. Enforcement actions may be taken regardless of the capital level of the institution. In particular, institutions that are not sufficiently capitalized in accordance with regulatory standards may also face capital directives or prompt corrective action. Enforcement actions may require certain corrective steps (including staff additions or changes), impose limits on activities (such as lending, deposit taking, acquisitions or branching), prescribe lending parameters (such as loan types, volumes and terms) and require additional capital to be raised, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Enforcement actions, including the imposition of monetary penalties, may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations, and damage to our reputation, and loss of our holding company status. In addition, compliance with any such action could distract management\u2019s attention from our operations, cause us to incur significant expenses, restrict us from engaging in potentially profitable activities, and limit our ability to raise capital. Closure of the Bank would result in a total loss of shareholder investment.", "PERMNO": 83831, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SGB"}
