{"cik": "20520", "company": "Frontier Communications Parent, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nBefore you make an investment decision with respect to any of our securities, you should carefully consider all the information we have included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our subsequent filings with the SEC. In particular, you should carefully consider the risk factors described below and the risks and uncertainties related to \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d any of which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this annual report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing Frontier.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions, may also adversely affect our business and operations. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the balance of this annual report, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness and we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future. Such debt and debt service obligations may adversely affect us.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have indebtedness of approximately $8 billion of which approximately $7 billion is secured. We may also be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the terms of the agreements currently governing our existing indebtedness restrict our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens, such restrictions are subject to several exceptions and qualifications, and the indebtedness and/or liens incurred in compliance with such restrictions may be substantial. Also, these restrictions do not prevent us or our restricted subsidiaries from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. In addition, to the extent other new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described below would increase.\nThe potential significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations that could result from our substantial debt include:\n\uf0b7limitations on our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all;\n\uf0b7instances in which we are unable to comply with the covenants contained in our indentures and credit agreement or to generate cash sufficient to make required debt payments, which circumstances have the potential of accelerating the maturity of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness;\n\uf0b7the allocation of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt, thus reducing the amount of our cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures that would otherwise improve our competitive position, results of operations or stock price;\n\uf0b7requiring us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;\n\uf0b7compromising our flexibility to plan for, or react to, competitive challenges in our business and the telecommunications industry;\n\uf0b7increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates, particularly given our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates, as well as to catastrophic events; and\n\uf0b7the possibility of our being put at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who, relative to their size, do not have as much debt as we do, and competitors who may be in a more favorable position to access additional capital resources.\nIn addition, our First Lien Notes and Second Lien Notes (including the Takeback Notes), as well as our subsidiary indebtedness, are rated below \u201cinvestment grade\u201d by independent rating agencies. This has resulted in higher borrowing costs for us. These rating agencies may lower our debt ratings further, if in the rating agencies\u2019 judgment such an action is appropriate. A further lowering of a rating would likely increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital. Our negotiations with vendors, customers and business partners can be negatively impacted if they deem us a credit risk as a result of our credit rating.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nThe agreements governing our current indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries that may reduce our operating and financial flexibility and we may not be able to satisfy our obligations under these or other, future debt arrangements.\nThe agreements governing our existing indebtedness contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to:\n\uf0b7incur additional debt and issue preferred stock;\n\uf0b7incur or create liens;\n\uf0b7redeem and/or prepay certain debt;\n\uf0b7pay dividends on our stock or repurchase stock;\n\uf0b7make certain investments;\n\uf0b7engage in specified sales of assets;\n\uf0b7enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\uf0b7engage in consolidation, mergers, and acquisitions.\nIn addition, our credit facilities require us to comply with specified financial ratios, including a maximum first lien coverage ratio. Any future indebtedness may also require us to comply with similar or other covenants.\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business could seriously harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions, and other corporate opportunities. Various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity for the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing. This could have serious consequences to our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrontier is primarily a holding company and, as a result, we rely on the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries in order to meet our cash needs and service our indebtedness, including the notes.\nFrontier is primarily a holding company and its principal assets consist of the shares of capital stock or other equity instruments of its subsidiaries. As a holding company, we depend on distributions, transfers, and other intracompany payments with our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. The operating results of our subsidiaries at any given time may not be sufficient to make distributions, transfers, or other payments to us in order to allow us to make payments on our indebtedness. In addition, the payment of these distributions, transfers, and other payments, as well as other transfers of assets, between our subsidiaries and from our subsidiaries to us may be subject to legal, regulatory, or contractual restrictions. Some state regulators have imposed, and others may consider imposing on regulated companies, including us, cash management practices that could limit the ability of such regulated companies to transfer cash between subsidiaries or to the parent company. While none of the existing state regulations materially affect our cash management, any changes to the existing regulations or imposition of new regulations or restrictions may materially adversely affect our ability to transfer cash within our consolidated companies.\nWe expect to make contributions to our pension plan in future years, the amount of which will be impacted by volatility in asset values related to Frontier\u2019s pension plan and/or changes in pension plan assumptions.\nUnder IRS regulations, we are required to make minimum contributions to our pension plan annually, based upon, among other factors, the value of plan assets relative to the funding target. We made contributions of $42 million and $64 million to our pension plan in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our required contributions for plan years 2021 and 2020, calculated as of January 1 of the relevant year, were approximately $172 million and $127 million, respectively. In 2021, we received an IRS waiver of the minimum funding standard under Section 412(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, and Section 302(c) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 for the 2020 minimum required distribution. With this waiver, we are spreading the 2020 minimum required contribution over the five subsequent plan years, in addition to the minimum contributions owed for those plan years. Further, we have adopted certain provisions of the American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA, effective for 2019 and 2020, which decreased the minimum required contributions for those years.\nWe expect to make contributions to our pension plan in future years and the amount of required contributions for future years could be significant. Volatility in our asset values, liability calculations, or returns may impact the costs of maintaining our pension plan and our future funding requirements. Any future contribution to our pension plan could be material and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity by reducing cash flows.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSignificant changes in discount rates, rates of return on pension assets, mortality tables and other factors could adversely affect our earnings and equity and increase our pension funding requirements.\nPension costs and obligations are determined using actual results as well as actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumptions are the discount rate, the long-term expected return on assets and mortality tables. Other assumptions include salary increases, lump sum payments, and retirement age. Some of these assumptions, such as the discount rate and return on pension assets, are reflective of economic conditions and impacted by factors such as inflationary pressures that are largely out of our control. Changes in the pension assumptions could have a material impact on pension costs and obligations, and could in turn have a material adverse effect on our earnings, equity, and funding requirements.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf our fiber expansion plan or other initiatives to increase our revenues, customer trends, profitability and cash flows are unsuccessful, our financial position and results of operations will be negatively and adversely impacted.\nWe must produce adequate revenues and operating cash flows that, when combined with cash on hand and borrowing under our revolving credit facility and other financings, will be sufficient to service our debt, fund our capital expenditures, taxes, pension and other employee benefit obligations and other operating expenses. We continue to experience revenue declines as compared to prior years. We have undertaken, and expect to continue to undertake, programs and initiatives with the objective of improving revenues, customer trends, profitability, and cash flows by enhancing our operations and customer service and support processes. In particular, under our fiber expansion plan we intend to grow our fiber network and optimize our existing copper network at attractive internal rates of return (IRRs) in order to increase our revenues and customer trends, and in turn increase our profitability and cash flows. We have historically experienced significant challenges in achieving such improvements. In addition, these programs and initiatives require significant investment and other resources and may divert attention from ongoing operations and other strategic initiatives.\nThere can be no assurance that our current and future initiatives and programs will be successful, or that the actual returns from these programs and initiatives will not be lower than anticipated or take longer to realize than we anticipate. For example, we may not reach our targets to expand and penetrate our existing fiber network on the timelines we anticipate, or at all. If current and future programs and initiatives are unsuccessful, result in lower returns than we anticipate, or take longer than we anticipate, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our results of operations.\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on market conditions, may adversely impact our business and hinder our fiber expansion plans. In addition, we continue to evaluate the potential impact to our business and results of operations of certain federal, state, and local regulatory requirements in response to COVID-19.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 and the resulting economic downturn adversely affected the financial markets and the economy more generally, which could adversely impact our business. As of December 31, 2021, the markets remain volatile and the economic outlook remains uncertain.\nWhile overall the operational and financial impacts to our business of the COVID-19 pandemic for the year ended December 31, 2021 were not significant, we continue to closely monitor the evolution of the pandemic, including new COVID-19 variants, as well as the ongoing impact to our employees, our customers, our business and our results of operations. We have experienced a slowdown in service activations for certain customers; to date, these negative impacts have been partially offset by higher consumer activations and lower churn, but there can be no assurance they will continue to be offset. We also continue to closely track our customers\u2019 payment activity as well as external factors, including the expiration of federal wage subsidies for individuals and small businesses which could materially impact payment trends. With more people working from home, we have experienced higher demands on our network and higher sales activity for our consumer broadband service offering. This sustained increase in network demand could lead to reduced network availability and potential outages, which may impair our ability to meet customer service level commitments, lead to higher costs, higher customer churn and potential increased regulatory actions. These potential changes, among others, could have a material financial impact to Frontier.\nOur response to COVID-19 has included several operational safety precautions. We continue to monitor the applicable federal, state, or local requirements and any potential impact it may have on our workforce.\nPotential longer-term impacts of COVID-19 on our business include the potential for higher borrowing costs and incremental financing needs. Our analysis of the potential impact of COVID-19 is subject to change. We are unable to predict the timing, duration or intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on the business and general economic conditions in the United States of America and the markets in which we operate. Our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be significantly affected by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.\nPotential disruptions in our supply chain and the effects of inflation, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the global microchip shortage, or otherwise, may adversely impact our business and hinder our fiber expansion plans.\nThrough December 31, 2021, we had not experienced any significant disruptions in our supply chain; however, some of our business partners, have been impacted by COVID-related workforce absences and other disruptions which have affected our\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nservice levels and distribution of work. In particular, network electronics that require microchip processors have experienced supply chain constraints due to the global microchip shortage.\nWhile we have endeavored to diversify our supplier and contractor base, we cannot assure you that we will not experience significant shortages or delays in our supply chain relating to materials, labor, and other inputs necessary to our fiber expansion plans. Any such shortages or delays may adversely impact our ability to reach our fiber expansion targets on budget and on time.\nIn addition, during fiscal 2021 we began to experience the impact of inflation-sensitive items, including upward pressure on the cost of materials, labor, and other items that are critical to our business. We continue to monitor these impacts closely and, if costs continue to rise, may be unable to recoup losses or offset diminished margins by passing these costs through to our customers or implementing offsetting cost reductions.\nThe communications industry is very competitive, and some of our competitors have superior resources which may place us at a disadvantage.\nWe face competition in every aspect of our business. Through mergers and various service expansion strategies, service providers are striving to provide integrated solutions both within and across geographic markets. Our competitors include cable companies, wireless and wireline carriers, satellite, fiber \u201coverbuilders\u201d and OTT companies, some of which may be subject to less regulation than we are. These entities may provide services competitive with the services that we offer or intend to introduce. For example, our competitors may seek to introduce networks in our markets that are competitive with or superior to our copper-based networks in those markets. Several competitors were successful bidders in the RDOF auction in areas within Frontier\u2019s service footprint and we expect these competitors will deploy expanded services in these areas that will compete with our services. We also believe that wireless, cable, and other providers have increased their penetration of various services in our markets. We expect that competition will remain robust. Our revenue and cash flow will be adversely impacted if we cannot reverse our customer losses or continue to provide high-quality services.\nSome of our competitors have market presence, engineering, technical, marketing, and financial capabilities which are substantially greater than ours. In addition, some of these competitors have less debt and are able to raise capital at a lower cost than we are able to. Consequently, some of these competitors may be able to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructures more quickly, adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, including leading edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and various types of data science, as well as take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services than we will be able to. Additionally, the greater brand name recognition of some competitors may require us to price our services at lower levels in order to retain or obtain customers. Finally, the cost advantages and greater financial resources of some of these competitors may give them the ability to reduce their prices for an extended period of time if they so choose. Our business and results of operations may be materially adversely impacted if we are not able to effectively compete.\nWe cannot predict which of the many possible future technologies, products or services will be important to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies, products, or services. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on the effectiveness of capital expenditure investments in infrastructure, products and services, our marketing efforts, our ability to deliver high quality customer service, our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry, including a changing regulatory environment that may affect our business and that of our competitors differently, new services that may be introduced, changes in consumer preferences, or habits, demographic trends, economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors. Increasing competition may reduce our revenues and increase our marketing and other costs as well as require us to increase our capital expenditures and thereby decrease our cash flows.\nWe may be unable to meet the technological needs or expectations of our customers and may lose customers as a result.\nThe communications industry is subject to significant changes in technology and replacing or upgrading our infrastructure to keep pace with such technological changes could result in significant capital expenditures. If we do not replace or upgrade technology and equipment and manage broadband speeds and capacity as necessary, we may be unable to compete effectively because we will not be able to meet the needs or expectations of our customers.\nIn addition, enhancements to product offerings may influence our customers to consider other service providers, such as cable operators or wireless providers. We may be unable to attract new or retain existing customers from cable companies due to their deployment of enhanced broadband and VoIP technology. In addition, new capacity services for broadband technologies may permit our competitors to offer broadband data services to our customers throughout most or all of our service areas. Any resulting inability to attract new or retain existing customers could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a material manner.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nWe rely on network and information systems and other technology, and a disruption or failure of such networks, systems or technology as a result of computer viruses, cyber-attacks, misappropriation of data or other malfeasance, as well as outages, accidental releases of information or similar events, may disrupt our business and materially impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur information technology, networks, and infrastructure may be subject to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to computer viruses, cyber-attacks or breaches, employee or third-party error or malfeasance, power outages, communication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events.\nFurther, our network and information systems are subject to various risks related to third parties and other parties we may not fully control. We use encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide secure transmission of confidential information, including our business data and customer information. Similarly, we rely on employees in our network operations centers, data centers and call centers to follow our procedures when handling sensitive information. While we select our third-party business partners and employees carefully, we do not control their actions, which could expose us to cyber-security risks. In addition, our customers using our network to access the Internet may become victim to malicious and abusive Internet activities, such as unsolicited mass advertising (or spam), peer-to-peer file sharing, distribution of viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software; these activities could adversely affect our network, result in excessive call volume at our call centers and damage our or our customers\u2019 equipment and data.\nWhile we maintain security measures, disaster recovery plans and business continuity plans for our business and are continuously working to upgrade our existing technology systems and provide employee training around the cyber risks we face, these risks are constantly evolving and are challenging to mitigate. Like many companies, we are the subject of increasingly frequent cyber-attacks. Any unauthorized access, computer viruses, ransomware attacks, accidental or intentional release of confidential information or other disruptions could result in misappropriation of our or our customers\u2019 sensitive information; financial loss; reputational harm; increased costs, such as those relating to remediation or future protection; customer dissatisfaction, which could lead to a decline in customers and revenue; government investigations and legal claims or proceedings, fines and other liabilities. There can be no assurance that the impact of such incidents would not be material to our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nOur business is sensitive to continued relationships with our wholesale customers.\nWe have substantial business relationships with other communications carriers for which we provide service. While we seek to maintain and grow our business with these customers, we face significant competition for this wholesale business. If we fail to maintain our grow this business, our revenues and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nA significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 70% of our total employees were represented by unions and were subject to collective bargaining agreements. The term of our collective bargaining agreements is typically three years and at any point in time we generally have several agreements under negotiation and extension. Approximately 23% of our unionized employees are covered by collective agreements that are scheduled to expire in 2022. In addition, approximately 45% of the unionized workforce are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are on extensions from the dates on which they originally expired in 2020 or 2021.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of negotiations of the collective bargaining agreements covering our employees. If we are unable to reach new agreements or renew existing agreements, employees subject to collective bargaining agreements may engage in strikes, work slowdowns or other labor actions, which could materially disrupt our ability to provide services. New labor agreements or the renewal of existing agreements may impose significant additional costs on us, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future.\nClimate change and increasingly stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations, and customer expectations, could adversely affect our business.\nThere is a heightened public focus on climate change, sustainability, and environmental issues and customer, regulatory and shareholder expectations are evolving rapidly, with a focus on companies\u2019 climate change readiness, response, and mitigation strategies. This has led to increased government regulation and caused certain of our partners and vendors to incorporate environmental standards into our business with them. We expect that the trend of increasing environmental awareness will continue, which will result in higher costs of operations. We are committed to incorporating environmentally sustainable practices into our business, including those focused on reducing our carbon footprint and emissions, managing energy use and efficiency, and enhancing our use of renewable energy and device recycling. While undertaken in a manner designed to be as efficient and cost effective as possible, this may result in increases in our costs of operations relative to our competitors.\nThe potential impact of climate change on our operations and our customers remains uncertain. The primary risk that climate change poses to our business is the potential for increases in severe weather in the areas in which we operate. Increasing frequency and intensity of rainfall and tropical storms, flooding, wildfires, sustained high wind events and freezing conditions, including related power outages, could impair our ability to build and maintain our network and lead to disruptions in our services\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nand supply chain. These changes could be severe and could negatively impact our operations. In addition, governmental initiatives to address climate change could, if adopted, restrict our operations, require us to make capital expenditures to comply with these initiatives, increase our costs, impact our ability to compete. Our inability to timely respond to the risks posed by climate change and the costs of compliance with climate change laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on us.\nIn addition, the local exchange carrier subsidiaries we operate are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, disposal of, and exposure to hazardous materials, the release of pollutants into the environment and the remediation of contamination. As an owner and former owner of property, we are subject to environmental laws that could impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup at contaminated sites, including sites formerly owned by us, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the activity that resulted in contamination.\nNegotiations with the providers of content for our video systems may not be successful, potentially resulting in our inability to carry certain programming channels on our video systems, which could result in the loss of subscribers. Alternatively, because of the power of some content providers, we may be forced to pay an increasing amount for some content, resulting in higher expenses and lower profitability.\nWe continue to execute on our video strategy of achieving savings by renegotiating contracts to lower content costs or dropping channels entirely. The content owners of the programming that we carry on our multichannel video systems are the exclusive provider of the channels they offer. If we are unable to reach a mutually-agreed contract with a content owner, including pricing and carriage provisions, our existing agreements to carry this content may not be renewed, resulting in the blackout of these channels. The loss of content could result in loss of customers who place a high value on the particular content that is lost. In addition, many content providers own multiple channels. As a result, we typically have to negotiate the pricing for multiple channels rather than one and carry and pay for content that customers do not value, in order to have access to other content that customers do value. Some of our competitors have materially larger scale than we do, and may, as a result, be better positioned than we are in such negotiations. As a result of these factors, the cost of content acquisition may continue to increase faster than corresponding revenues which could result in lower profitability.\nWe are subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements.\nWe are party to various legal proceedings, including, from time to time, individual actions, class and putative class actions, and governmental investigations, covering a wide range of matters and types of claims including, but not limited to, general contract disputes, billing disputes, rights of access, taxes and surcharges, consumer protection, advertising, sales and the provision of services, trademark and patent infringement, employment, regulatory, tort, claims of competitors and disputes with carriers.\nIn connection with our emergence from bankruptcy, the Plan provided that holders of general unsecured claims, including, but not limited to, litigation claims against us and/or our subsidiaries, had their claims \u201cride through\u201d the bankruptcy, meaning there was no bar to or discharge of these claims. In particular, litigation claims against us survived the bankruptcy and those claims may be pursued against us. To the extent such claims could have been asserted prior to bankruptcy or arose during the bankruptcy, such claims can be asserted now that we have emerged from bankruptcy. In addition to potential liability for claims asserted against us, we have ongoing obligations to indemnify our former officers and directors and certain underwriters in connection with litigation as we did before the bankruptcy.\nLitigation is subject to uncertainty and the outcome if individual matters is not predictable. We may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay significant awards or enter into settlements with governmental or other entities which impose significant financial and business remediation measures.\nWe rely on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers and vendors for equipment and services relating to our network infrastructure, including network elements such as digital and Internet protocol switching and routing equipment, optical and copper transmission equipment, broadband connectivity equipment, various forms of customer premise equipment, optical fiber, wireless equipment, as well as the software that is used throughout our network to manage traffic, network elements, and other functions critical to our operations. If any of our major suppliers were to experience disruption, supply-chain interruptions, financial difficulties, or other unforeseen problems delivering, maintaining, or servicing these network components on a timely basis, our operations could suffer significantly. For example, supply chain and labor disruptions arising from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may affect the ability of our suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to us in a timely matter, or at all, which may adversely impact our operations. Our suppliers and vendors may also experience increased costs for their materials, labor, and other significant items due to inflation, which they could seek to pass along to us and their other customers. In addition, due to changes in the communications industry, the suppliers of many of these products and services have been consolidating. In the event it were to become necessary to seek alternative suppliers and vendors, we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacement supplies, services, or utilities on economically-attractive terms, on a timely basis, or at all, which could increase costs or cause disruptions in our services.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nOur historical financial information may not be indicative of our future financial performance as a result of the implementation of the Plan.\nOur capital structure was significantly altered under the Plan. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh start accounting in accordance with ASC 852, Reorganizations. Under fresh start accounting rules that apply to us upon the Effective Date, our assets and liabilities have been adjusted to fair value and our accumulated deficit has been restated to zero. In addition, we have adopted certain accounting policy changes as part of fresh start accounting and such policies could result in material changes to our financial reporting and results. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from Chapter 11 are not comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements. As a result, investors should not rely on these results as indicative of our future performance.\nRisks Related to Regulation and Oversight\nChanges in federal or state regulations may reduce the switched access charge and subsidy revenues we receive.\nA portion of Frontier\u2019s total revenues ($333 million, or 5%, in 2021 and $344 million, or 5%, in 2020) are derived from federal and state subsidies for rural and high-cost support, primarily CAF II support, and also including Federal High Cost support and various state subsidies. Excluding the support related to the Northwest Operations divested on May 1, 2020, we received $313 million in annual CAF II support through 2021 in return for our commitment to make broadband available to certain households within our service territory.\nOn January 30, 2020, the FCC adopted an order establishing the RDOF program. We participated in the RDOF Phase I auction and were awarded approximately $371 million over ten years to build gigabit-capable broadband over a fiber-to-the-premises network to approximately 127,000 locations in eight states (California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and West Virginia). Assuming Frontier\u2019s long-form RDOF application is granted by the FCC, we anticipate that we will begin receiving funding early in 2022.\nThe RDOF program will not be as favorable to us as the CAF Phase II program and will result in a material reduction in our annual FCC funding, from approximately $332 million in annual support under CAF II through 2021 to approximately $37 million in annual support under RDOF beginning in 2022. This will result in a material reduction in our revenue and operating income and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the FCC will review CAF II carriers\u2019 completion data and if the FCC determines that we did not satisfy our CAF II requirements we could be required to return a portion of the funds received and may be subject to certain other requirements and obligations.\nA portion of our total revenues ($75 million, or 1% in 2021 and $89 million, or 1%, in 2020) are derived from switched access charges paid by other carriers for services we provide in originating intrastate and interstate long-distance traffic. We expect a portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from switched access charges paid by these carriers for these services. The rates we can charge for switched access are regulated by the FCC and state regulatory agencies and could be further reduced in the future.\nCertain states also have their own open proceedings to address reform to originating intrastate access charges, other intercarrier compensation, and state universal service funds. Although the FCC has pre-empted state jurisdiction on most access charges, many states could consider moving forward with their proceedings. We cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on our subsidy or switched access revenues. However, future reductions in our subsidy or switched access revenues may directly affect our profitability and cash flows as those regulatory revenues do not have an equal level of associated variable expenses.\nWe are also required to contribute to the Universal Service Fund (\u201cUSF\u201d) and the FCC allows us to recover these contributions through a USF surcharge on customers\u2019 bills. This surcharge accounted for $83 million of revenue in the four months ended April 30, 2021 and $193 million in 2020. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, USF charges are recorded on a net basis, to Cost of Service expense. If we are unable to recover USF contributions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWhile we are implementing a number of operational initiatives in order to realize certain cost savings, our ability to achieve such cost savings on a timely basis, or at all, is subject to various risks and assumptions by our management, which may or may not be realized. Even if we do realize some or all of such cost savings, they may be insufficient to offset any reductions in subsidies or CAF II funding we receive, or our inability to recover USF contributions.\nFrontier and our industry are expected to remain highly regulated, and we could incur substantial compliance costs that could constrain our ability to compete in our target markets.\nAs an incumbent local exchange carrier, some of the services we offer are subject to significant regulation from federal, state, and local authorities. This regulation could impact our ability to change our rates, especially on our basic voice services and our access rates and could impose substantial compliance costs on us. In some jurisdictions, regulation may restrict our ability to expand our service offerings. In addition, changes to the regulations that govern our business may have an adverse effect on our\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nbusiness by reducing the allowable fees that we may charge, imposing additional compliance costs, reducing the amount of subsidies, or otherwise changing the nature of our operations and the competition in our industry. At this time, it is unknown how these regulations, regulatory oversight, or changes to these regulations will affect our operations or ability to compete in the future.\nFCC rulemakings and state regulatory proceedings, including those relating to Internet access offerings, could have a substantial adverse impact on our operations.\nOur Internet access offerings could become subject to additional laws and regulations as they are adopted or applied to the Internet. As the significance of the Internet expands, federal, state and local governments may pass laws and adopt rules and regulations, including those directed at privacy or service rates, or apply existing laws and regulations to the Internet (including Internet access services), and related matters are under consideration in both federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies. Although the FCC has pre-empted state jurisdiction on network neutrality and privacy, many states, including California, have considered, or are moving forward with legislation or other regulatory actions related to these or other Internet-related issues. We cannot predict whether the outcome of expected or pending challenges to the FCC\u2019s regulations or subsequent state actions will prove beneficial or detrimental to our competitive position.\nWe are subject to the oversight of certain federal and state agencies that may investigate or pursue enforcement actions against us relating to consumer protection matters.\nCertain federal and state agencies, including state attorneys general, monitor and exercise oversight related to consumer protection matters, including those affecting the communications industry. Such agencies have in the past, and may in the future, choose to launch an inquiry or investigation of our business practices in response to customer complaints or other publicized customer service issues or disruptions, including regarding the failure to meet technological needs or expectations of our customers. For example; in May 2021, the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), joined by five state attorneys general in Arizona, Indiana, Michigan, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, and two District Attorneys in California, filed a complaint against us in Federal Court relating to alleged misrepresentations in our advertising relating to Internet speeds we were capable of delivering to DSL customers. In October 2021, the court dismissed the five-state attorney general claims but permitted the FTC\u2019s and California\u2019s claims to proceed. Such inquiries or investigations could result in reputational harm, enforcement actions, litigation, fines, settlements, and/or operational and financial conditions being placed on the Company, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to the oversight of certain federal and state regulatory agencies regarding commitments that were made by or imposed on the Company by the regulatory agencies in association with securing federal and state regulatory approval for the Restructuring.\nThe Company made several affirmative commitments to federal and certain state regulators to secure approval for the Restructuring, including specific investment, broadband service deployment, service quality improvements, reporting, and compliance commitments. Regulators will monitor and may launch compliance inquiries or investigations and if the Company is found to have failed to comply with its obligations it could result in reputational harm, enforcement actions, litigation, penalties, fines, settlements and/or operational and financial conditions being placed on the Company, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nTax legislation may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nTax laws are dynamic and continually change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. For example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the TCJA. The TCJA makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code and, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, and imposes limitations on the use of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate resulted in a decreased valuation of our deferred tax asset and liabilities.\nMore recently, on March 18, 2020, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCR Act), and on March 27, 2020, the CARES Act were each enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The FFCR Act and the CARES Act contain numerous income tax provisions, such as relaxing limitations on the deductibility of interest and the use of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The Company evaluated the impact of this legislation on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows and determined no monetary impact.\nThe determination of the benefit from (or provision for) income taxes requires complex estimations and significant judgments concerning the applicable tax laws. If in the future any element of tax legislation changes the tax code for income taxes, it could affect our income tax position and we may need to adjust the benefit from (or provision for) income taxes accordingly.\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for them. Many factors, which may be outside our control, may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including those described elsewhere in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, as well as the following:\n\uf0b7variations in our operating and financial performance and prospects from period to period;\n\uf0b7our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry compared to market expectations;\n\uf0b7the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\n\uf0b7market overhang due to substantial holdings by former creditors that may wish to dispose of our common stock;\n\uf0b7coverage by or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet their expectations;\n\uf0b7market and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our fiber expansion strategy;\n\uf0b7strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\uf0b7changes in laws or regulations which adversely affect our industry or us;\n\uf0b7changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;\n\uf0b7changes in senior management or key personnel;\n\uf0b7issuances, exchanges, or sales, or expected issuances, exchanges, or sales of our capital stock;\n\uf0b7adverse resolution of new or pending litigation against us; and\n\uf0b7changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war and responses to such events.\nThese broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low. As a result, you may suffer a loss on your investment.\nIf there are substantial sales of shares of our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe market price of the shares of our common stock could decline as a result of the sale of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in the public market, or the perception in the market that our significant stockholders intend to sell a significant number of their shares.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently have no intention to pay dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, certain of our debt instruments contain covenants that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us.\nDelaware law and certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change the direction or management of our Company.\nOur certificate of incorporation and our by-laws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our Company more difficult without the approval of our Board, including, but not limited to, the following: action by stockholders may only be taken at an annual or special meeting duly called by or at the direction of our board of directors; and advance notice for all stockholder proposals is required.\nThese and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to initiate actions that are opposed by our board of directors, including actions to delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our Company. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of our common stock and limit opportunities for you to realize value in a corporate transaction.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports, about us, our business, or our industry, or if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our industry, or our competitors. If we do not maintain adequate research coverage or if any of the analysts who may cover us downgrade our stock, publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or provide relatively more favorable recommendations about our competitors, our stock price could decline. If any analyst who may cover us\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nwere to cease coverage of our Company or fail to regularly publish reports about us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nGeneral Risks\nThe ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to the success of our business and may be affected by our emergence from bankruptcy.\nOur success depends in part upon key personnel. The composition of our management team changed significantly in 2021; qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. The loss of key employees or unexpected changes in the composition of our senior management team could materially and adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. We cannot guarantee that our key personnel will not leave or compete with us. If executives, managers, or other key personnel resign, retire, or are terminated, or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner. The loss, incapacity, or unavailability for any reason of key members of our management team could have a material adverse impact on our business.\n\u200e\nFRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS PARENT, INC., AND SUBSIDIARIES", "PERMNO": 23887, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "FTRCQ"}
