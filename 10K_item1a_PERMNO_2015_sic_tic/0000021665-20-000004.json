{"cik": "21665", "company": "COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report, set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities. These risks are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which might cause the value of our securities to decline.\nWe face risks associated with significant international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\nWe operate on a global basis serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with approximately 70% of our Net sales originating in markets outside the U.S. While geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we face risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to:\n\u25aa\nchanges in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows from non-U.S. markets or increase our supply costs, as measured in U.S. dollars, in those markets;\n\u25aa\nexchange controls and other limits on our ability to import or export raw materials or finished product or to repatriate earnings from overseas;\n\u25aa\npolitical or economic instability, geopolitical events, environmental events, widespread health emergencies, such as the novel coronavirus or other pandemics or epidemics, natural disasters, or social or labor unrest;\n\u25aa\nchanging macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of volatile commodity prices, including the price of oil;\n\u25aa\nlack of well-established, reliable and/or impartial legal systems in certain countries where we operate and difficulties in enforcing contractual, intellectual property or other legal rights;\n\u25aa\nforeign ownership and investment restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources; and\n\u25aa\nchanges to trade policies and agreements and other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of and/or the increase in onerous trade restrictions and/or tariffs, sanctions, price controls, labor laws, travel or immigration restrictions, profit controls or other government controls.\nAll of the foregoing risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, a number of these risks may adversely impact consumer confidence and consumption, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings.\nIn addition, the impact of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from, and the related negotiations with, the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit) are, at this time, unclear. Brexit has created legal, political and economic uncertainty, which could subject us to heightened risks in the region, including disruptions to trade and the free movement of goods, services and people to and from the United Kingdom, increased foreign exchange volatility with respect to the British pound and disruptions to our workforce and that of our suppliers and business partners. We do not, however, believe Brexit will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nFurthermore, the recent imposition of tariffs and/or increase in tariffs on various products by the United States and other countries have introduced greater uncertainty with respect to trade policies and government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries and new and/or increased tariffs have subjected, and may continue in the future to subject, us to additional costs and expenditure of resources. Major developments in trade relations, including the imposition of new or increased tariffs by the United States and/or other countries, and any emerging nationalist trends in specific countries could alter the trade environment and consumer purchasing behavior which, in turn, could have a material effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements, we engage in a combination of selling price increases, where permitted, sourcing strategies, cost-containment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions. However, the impact of these measures may not fully offset any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nSignificant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business.\nWe face vigorous competition worldwide, including from strong local competitors and from other large, multinational companies, some of which may have greater resources than we do. In addition, the substantial growth in eCommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models.\nWe face competition in several aspects of our business, including pricing, promotional activities, new product introductions and expansion into new geographies and channels. Some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on or have more effective advertising and promotional activities than we do, introduce competing products more quickly and/or respond more effectively to changing consumer preferences and business and economic conditions. Such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising. Our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to enforce and defend our intellectual property, including patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and trade dress rights against infringement and legal challenges by competitors.\nWe may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully respond to them, which could harm our business. In addition, the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges, including management time, out-of-pocket expenses and price reductions, may affect our performance in the relevant period. A failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIncreasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets, changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, the emergence of alternative retail channels and the rapidly changing retail landscape may adversely affect our business.\nOur products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and eCommerce retailers. With the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, the rapid growth of eCommerce and the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers, we are increasingly dependent on certain retailers, and some of these retailers have and may continue to have greater bargaining strength than we do. They have used and may continue to use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts, allowances or slotting fees, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. The loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in sales to a key customer could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information regarding our customers, see \u201cDistribution; Raw Materials; Competition; Trademarks and Patents\u201d in Item 1 \u201cBusiness.\u201d\nWe also have been and may continue to be negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions. For example, a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or that our packaging does not comply with certain environmental standards or initiatives could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, \u201cprivate label\u201d products sold by our retail customers, which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products, are a source of competition for certain of our products.\nIn addition, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to be impacted by the rapid growth of eCommerce retailers, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online) and the emergence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-customer businesses. The rapid growth in eCommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers. If we are not successful in adapting or effectively reacting to changes in consumer preferences and market dynamics and/or expanding sales through eCommerce retailers and other alternative retail channels, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the U.S. and abroad.\nOur business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the U.S. and abroad. Such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products, including their development, ingredients, formulation, manufacture, packaging content, labeling, storage, transportation, distribution, export, import, advertising, sale and environmental impact. U.S. federal authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d), the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency, regulate different aspects of our business, along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas. In addition, our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the U.S. and abroad.\nNew or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements, or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For example, from time to time, various regulatory authorities in Europe, the U.S. and other countries review the use of various ingredients and packaging content in consumer products. A decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that any ingredient or packaging content in our products should be restricted or should otherwise be newly regulated, could adversely impact our business and reputation, as could negative reactions by our consumers, trade customers or non-governmental organizations to our current or prior use of such ingredients or packaging. Additionally, an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients, to obtain regulatory approval of such products on a timely basis or to effectively market and sell such products could likewise adversely affect our business.\nBecause of our extensive international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of worldwide anti-bribery laws, including those that prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), and laws that prohibit commercial bribery. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, joint venture partners or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWhile it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, a finding that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the cost of responding to such a claim, including management time and out-of-pocket expenses, and the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products, processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation, brand image and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For information regarding our legal and regulatory matters, see Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe growth of our business depends on the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new products.\nOur growth depends on the continued success of existing products, the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new and differentiated products and the expansion into adjacent categories, channels of distribution or geographies. Our ability to launch new products, to sustain existing products and to expand into adjacent categories, channels of distribution or geographies is affected by whether we can successfully:\n\u25aa\nidentify, develop and fund technological innovations;\n\u25aa\nobtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others;\n\u25aa\nobtain approvals and registrations of regulated products, including from the FDA and other regulatory bodies in the U.S. and abroad; and\n\u25aa\nanticipate and quickly respond to consumer needs and preferences.\nThe identification, development and introduction of innovative new products involves considerable costs and effort, and any new product may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion. Our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product could also be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch, such as increased promotional activities and advertising. In addition, new products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace.\nOur ability to quickly innovate and to adapt our products to meet evolving consumer preferences is an essential part of our business strategy. The failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIf, in the course of identifying or developing new products, we are found to have infringed the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, through the use of third-party ideas or technologies, such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Even if we are not found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, claims of infringement could adversely affect us, including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products.\nDamage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.\nMaintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products. Accordingly, we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as our Ethics and Compliance, Sustainability, Brand Protection and Product Safety, Regulatory and Quality initiatives. Negative publicity about us, our brands, our products, our supply chain, our ingredients, our packaging or our employees, whether or not deserved, could jeopardize our reputation. Such negative publicity could relate to, among other things, health concerns, threatened or pending litigation or regulatory proceedings, environmental impacts (including packaging, energy and water use and waste management) or other sustainability or policy issues. In addition, widespread use of digital and social media by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility of information and the speed of its dissemination. Negative publicity, posts or comments on social media about us, our brands, our products, our packaging or our employees, whether true or untrue, could damage our brands and our reputation. The success of our brands could also suffer if our marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand\u2019s image or its ability to attract consumers.\nAdditionally, due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other external business partners, for certain functions. While we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk.\nIn addition, third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products, which are inferior or may pose safety risks. As a result, consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products, which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nDamage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation.\nThere is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful.\nOne way that we generate funds needed to support the growth of our business is through our continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization, which we refer to as our funding-the-growth initiatives. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics, and advertising and promotional materials, among other things. The achievement of our funding-the-growth goals depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize additional savings opportunities. Events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing any or all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. If we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our funding-the-growth initiatives, our ability to fund other initiatives and achieve our profitability goals may be adversely affected. Any failure to implement our funding-the-growth initiatives in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information regarding our funding-the-growth initiatives, refer to Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview.\u201d\nVolatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitability.\nRaw and packaging material commodities, such as resins, essential oils, pulp, tropical oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans, are subject to market price variations. Increases in the costs and/or a reduction in the availability of commodities, energy and transportation and other necessary services have affected and may continue to adversely affect our profit margins. If commodity and other cost increases continue in the future and we are unable to pass along such higher costs in the form of price increases, achieve cost efficiencies, such as in manufacturing and distribution, or otherwise manage the exposure through sourcing strategies, ongoing productivity initiatives and the limited use of commodity hedging contracts, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely impacted. In addition, even if we are able to increase the prices of our products in response to commodity and other cost increases, we may not be able to sustain the price increases. Also, sustained price increases may lead to declines in volume as competitors may not adjust their prices or consumers may decide not to pay higher prices, which could lead to sales declines and loss of market share and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See \u201cDisruption in our global supply chain or key office facilities could adversely impact our business\u201d below for additional information.\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management.\nOur success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees. If we are unable to attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key people, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. Successfully executing organizational change, including management transitions at leadership levels of the Company and succession plans for senior management, is critical to our business success. While we follow a disciplined, ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time. Further, changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate highly skilled technical, professional and management personnel to meet our business needs.\nLegal claims and proceedings could adversely impact our business.\nAs a global company serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories, we may be subject to a wide variety of legal claims and proceedings, including disputes relating to intellectual property, contracts, product liability, marketing, advertising, foreign exchange controls, antitrust and trade regulation, as well as labor and employment, pension, data privacy and security, environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions. Regardless of their merit, these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend. Since litigation is inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings, or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection therewith, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. In addition, if one of our products, or an ingredient contained in our products, is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe, we may need to recall or reformulate some of our products. Whether or not a legal claim or proceeding is successful, or a recall or reformulation is required, such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image. The resolution of, or increase in the reserves taken in connection with, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition for that period. See Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on certain of our legal claims and proceedings.\nDisruption in our global supply chain or key office facilities could adversely impact our business.\nWe are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale. Our operations and those of our suppliers or contract manufacturers could be disrupted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25aa\nenvironmental events;\n\u25aa\nwidespread health emergencies, such as the novel coronavirus or other pandemics or epidemics;\n\u25aa\nstrikes and other labor disputes;\n\u25aa\ndisruptions in logistics;\n\u25aa\nloss or impairment of key manufacturing sites;\n\u25aa\nloss of key suppliers or contract manufacturers;\n\u25aa\nsupplier capacity constraints;\n\u25aa\nraw material and product quality or safety issues;\n\u25aa\nindustrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues;\n\u25aa\nthe impact on our suppliers of tighter credit or capital markets;\n\u25aa\nthe lack of availability of qualified personnel, such as truck drivers;\n\u25aa\ngovernmental incentives and controls (including import and export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers); and\n\u25aa\nnatural disasters, including climatic events (including any potential effect of climate change) and earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, political unrest or uncertainty, fires or explosions and other external factors over which we have no control.\nIn addition, we purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers and new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and Colgate standards, which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time.\nWe believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate. In addition, we have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw and packaging materials. Nonetheless, a significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials for any reason, including those mentioned above, could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn addition, as a result of our global shared service organizational model, certain of our functions, such as marketing, payroll, finance and accounting, customer service and logistics, and human resources, are concentrated in key office facilities. A significant disruption to any of our key office facilities for any reason, including those mentioned above, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nA cyber-security incident, data breach or a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our business.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems (\u201cIT Systems\u201d), including some which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties, including cloud-based service providers, and their vendors, in order to conduct our business. Our uses of these systems include, but are not limited to:\n\u25aa\ncommunicating within our company and with other parties, including our customers and consumers;\n\u25aa\nordering and managing materials from suppliers;\n\u25aa\nconverting materials to finished products;\n\u25aa\nreceiving and processing orders from, shipping products to and invoicing our customers and consumers;\n\u25aa\nmarketing products to consumers;\n\u25aa\ncollecting, storing, transferring and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data, including, but not limited to, such data from residents of the European Union who are covered by the General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect on May 25, 2018, and residents of the State of California who are covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which went into effect on January 1, 2020;\n\u25aa\nprocessing transactions, including but not limited to employee payroll, employee and retiree benefits and payments to customers and vendors;\n\u25aa\nhosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, intellectual property, business plans and financial information;\n\u25aa\nsummarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting;\n\u25aa\nmanaging our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms;\n\u25aa\ncomplying with legal, regulatory and tax requirements;\n\u25aa\nproviding data security; and\n\u25aa\nhandling other processes involved in managing our business.\nAlthough we have a broad array of information security measures in place, our IT Systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, phishing and other cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups, individuals and nation states with a wide range of expertise and motives. Such cyber-attacks and cyber incidents can take many forms, including cyber extortion, social engineering, password theft or introduction of viruses or malware, such as ransomware through phishing emails. We cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our, or our third-party service providers\u2019, IT Systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time. In addition, although we have policies and procedures in place to ensure that all personal information collected by us or our third-party service providers is securely maintained, data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct have occurred and likely will continue to occur. Although we have seen no material impact on our business operations from the cyber-security attacks and data breaches we have experienced to date, if we suffer a loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our IT Systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, we may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm, incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations, litigation, fines and/or damages, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nFurthermore, while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, if our IT Systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly for any reason, including the poor performance of, failure of or cyber-attack on third-party service providers, catastrophic events, power outages, cyber-security breaches, network outages, failed upgrades or other similar events and, if the disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm, and may be subject to governmental investigations and litigation, any of which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nUncertain global economic conditions, disruptions in the credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may adversely affect our business.\nUncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business. Unfavorable global economic conditions, such as a recession, economic slowdown and/or continued reduced category growth rates, have impacted and could continue to negatively impact our business and could result in declining revenues, profitability and cash flows. Although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points, during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may reduce consumption or switch to \u201cprivate label\u201d or economy brands, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings. Additionally, our retailers may be impacted and they may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lower-priced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins.\nWhile we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, a disruption in the credit markets, interest rate increases or changes to our credit ratings could negatively impact the availability or cost of funding. Reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. In addition, if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our undrawn revolving credit facilities supporting our commercial paper programs or other financing arrangements, such as interest rate, foreign exchange or commodity hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us. This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate, foreign currency or commodity price exposures. In addition, tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers, contract manufacturers or trade customers which could, in turn, adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions and divestitures, which could adversely impact our business.\nWe have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions of brands, businesses or technologies from third parties. Acquisitions and their pursuit involve numerous potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u25aa\nrealizing the full extent of the expected benefits or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all;\n\u25aa\nsuccessfully integrating the operations, technologies, services, products and systems of the acquired brands or businesses in an effective, timely and cost-efficient manner;\n\u25aa\nreceiving necessary consents, clearances and approvals in connection with a transaction;\n\u25aa\ndiverting management\u2019s attention from other business priorities;\n\u25aa\nsuccessfully operating in new lines of business, channels of distribution or markets;\n\u25aa\nretaining key employees, partners, suppliers and customers of the acquired business;\n\u25aa\nconforming standards, controls, procedures and policies of the acquired business with our own;\n\u25aa\ndeveloping or launching products with acquired technologies; and\n\u25aa\nother unanticipated problems or liabilities.\nMoreover, acquisitions could result in substantial additional debt, exposure to contingent liabilities, such as litigation or earn-out obligations, the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, or transaction costs. Any of these risks, should they materialize, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe also may periodically divest brands or businesses. These divestitures may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses, or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures. In addition, businesses under consideration for, or otherwise subject to, divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to the divestiture, which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nTax matters, including changes in tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could negatively impact our business.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and in the foreign jurisdictions where we do business. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions have been and may be subject to significant change. Changes in the mix of our earnings from countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, including how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, or contemplated changes in long-standing tax principles, if finalized and adopted, could adversely impact our future effective tax rate and business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For example, longstanding international tax norms that determine each country\u2019s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving as a result of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting reporting requirements (\u201cBEPS\u201d) recommended by the G8, G20 and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In connection with BEPS, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in countries outside of the U.S. As this and other tax laws and related regulations change, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially impacted. For more information regarding U.S. tax reform, see Note 11, Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFurthermore, we are subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to taxes inside and outside of the U.S. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, in excess of reserves. The payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nClimate change may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIt has been reported that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. The predicted effects of climate change may also exacerbate challenges regarding the availability and quality of water. In addition, concern over climate change may result in new or additional legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. Despite our sustainability efforts, any failure to achieve our sustainability goals to reduce our impact on the environment or the perception (whether or not valid) that we have failed to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change could result in adverse publicity and adversely affect our business and reputation. There is also increased focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers, consumers and other stakeholders on these and other sustainability matters, including deforestation and the use of plastic, energy and water. Our reputation could be damaged if we do not (or are perceived not to) act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 18729, "SIC": 2844, "TIC": "CL"}
