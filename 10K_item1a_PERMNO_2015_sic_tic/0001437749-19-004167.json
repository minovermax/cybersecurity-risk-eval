{"cik": "1365101", "company": "Primo Water Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nRestrictive covenants in our senior secured credit facility (the \u201cSunTrust Credit Facility\u201d) restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in or enter into a variety of transactions, which could adversely restrict our financial and operating flexibility and subject us to other risks.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had a $30.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) and $185.3 million outstanding on our term loan facility (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d) pursuant to the SunTrust Credit Facility. The SunTrust Credit Facility contains various restrictive covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to take certain actions. In particular, these agreements limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u25cf\nincur liens on our assets or enter into sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u25cf\nmerge or enter into other change of control transactions;\n\u25cf\nmake certain loans and investments;\n\u25cf\nmake or declare dividends or other restricted payments or repurchase shares of capital stock;\n\u25cf\nconduct certain restricted asset sales;\n\u25cf\namend or otherwise alter our organizational documents and certain material agreements;\n\u25cf\nmake any significant changes in accounting treatment or reporting practices, except as required by GAAP; and\n\u25cf\nengage in transactions with affiliates.\nAny or all of these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities and to fund our operations. Any future debt could also contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those currently imposed pursuant to the SunTrust Credit Facility.\nA breach of a covenant or other provision in any debt instrument governing our current or future indebtedness, including the SunTrust Credit Facility, could result in a default under that instrument and, due to customary cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions, could result in a default under any other debt instrument that we may have. If the lenders under our indebtedness were to so accelerate the payment of the indebtedness, we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay in full our outstanding indebtedness, in which event we likely would seek reorganization or protection under bankruptcy or other, similar laws.\nWe incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness in connection with the Acquisition, which we refinanced in June 2018, and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations. In addition, our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to support operations and other activities without debt financing could prevent future growth and success.\nThe amount of our indebtedness or such other obligations could have important consequences for us, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\na substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other general corporate purposes and our ability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding indebtedness may be impaired in the future;\n\u25cf\nwe are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\u25cf\nwe may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt or with comparable debt at more favorable terms and that, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns;\n\u25cf\nour ability to refinance indebtedness may be limited or the associated costs may increase;\n\u25cf\nour ability to engage in acquisitions or make additional capital investments without raising additional equity or obtaining additional debt financing may be impaired in the future;\n\u25cf\nit may be more difficult for us to satisfy our general obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness;\n\u25cf\nwe may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u25cf\nour flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and our ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited, or we may be prevented from making capital investments that are necessary or important to our operations in general, growth strategy and efforts to improve operating margins of our business segments.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends in part on our ability to generate cash from future operations. Our ability to generate cash, make scheduled payments on our indebtedness or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance, cash flow and capital resources depend in part upon prevailing economic conditions and various financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions on terms acceptable to us, or at all, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to support capital expansion, potential business acquisition plans and general operating activities, and are unable obtain the necessary funding for these items through equity financing, debt financing, or some combination thereof, our business could be negatively affected and we may be unable to expand into existing and new markets. Our ability to generate cash flows is dependent in part upon obtaining necessary financing at favorable interest rates. Interest rate fluctuations and other capital market conditions may prevent us from doing so.\nThe interest rates under our SunTrust Credit Facility may be impacted by the phase-out of LIBOR.\nLIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rates on loans globally. We generally use LIBOR as a reference rate to calculate interest rates under our SunTrust Credit Facility. In 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if LIBOR will cease to exist at that time or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), calculated using short-term repurchase agreements backed by Treasury securities. SOFR is observed and backward looking, unlike LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). SOFR also may be more volatile than LIBOR. Whether or not SOFR, or another alternative reference rate, attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. At this time, due to a lack of consensus as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on our liquidity. As of March 1, 2019, we had $188.3 million of borrowings under our credit facilities that bore interest rates based on LIBOR. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our credit agreements extending beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with an agreed upon replacement index, and certain of the interest rates under our credit agreements may change. The new rates may not be as favorable to us as those in effect prior to any LIBOR phase-out, which may cause the amount of interest payable under such credit arrangements to be different than expected. We may also find it desirable to engage in more frequent interest rate hedging transactions.\nGlobal capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers, bottlers, distributors and customers.\nThe global capital and credit markets have experienced increased volatility and disruption, making it more difficult for companies to access those markets. There can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets will not impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our suppliers, bottlers, distributors or retail customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy or in their respective industries.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nWe depend on a small number of large retailers for a significant portion of our consumer sales. Our arrangements with these retailers for our products are generally nonexclusive and terminable at will.\nCertain retailers have historically made up a significant percentage of our retail sales volume, such that if one or more of these retailers were to materially reduce or terminate its business with us, our sales would suffer. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Walmart, Lowe\u2019s Home Improvement and Home Depot represented approximately 33%, 9% and 8% of our consolidated net sales; 25%, 0%, and 0% of our Refill net sales; 29%, 20%, and 29% of our Exchange net sales and 66%, 20%, and 2% of our Dispenser net sales, respectively. While we sell a small percentage of our dispensers directly to consumers through our online store and other direct sales channels, the vast majority of our sales are made through our retail partners.\nWe have arrangements with certain retailers for our products, but we cannot provide any assurance of any future sales. None of our significant retail accounts are contractually bound to offer our products. As a result, retailers can discontinue our products at any time and offer a competitor\u2019s products, or none at all. Additionally, the contractual commitments of many of our retail customers are typically not long-term in nature. In addition, contracts to which Glacier was a party prior to the Acquisition, and to which we are now a party, also contain termination clauses. Continued positive relations with a retailer depend upon a number of factors, including price, customer service, consumer demand and competition. Certain of our retailers have policies requiring them to solicit multiple vendors for one or more products and may seek to offer a competitor\u2019s products or services at new or existing locations. If any significant retailer materially reduces, terminates or is unwilling to expand its relationship with us, or requires price reductions or other adverse modifications in our selling terms, our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows would suffer. Furthermore, we could be adversely affected if any of our key retail customers elects to de-emphasize or reduce their product offerings in the categories with which we supply them, and such a reduction could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nAdditionally, most major retailers continually evaluate and often modify their in-store retail strategies, including product placement, store set-up and design, promotions and demographic targets. Our business could suffer significant setbacks in net sales and operating income if one or more of our major retail customers modified its current retail strategy resulting in a termination or reduction of its business relationship with us, a reduction in store penetration or an unfavorable product placement within such retailer\u2019s stores, any or all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe success of our business depends on retailer and consumer acceptance of our products.\nWe are a consumer products company operating in the highly-competitive bottled water market and rely on continued consumer demand or preference for our products. To generate sales and profits, we must sell products that appeal to retailers and to consumers. Our future success depends on consumer acceptance, particularly at the household level, of our products. There is no guarantee that there will be significant market acceptance of our products on a scale necessary to achieve sustained profitability and the growth we desire.\nAs a result of our \u201crazor-razorblade\u201d business strategy, we are reliant on consumer adoption of our \u201crazors\u201d (Dispensers) to drive sales of the \u201crazorblades\u201d (Exchange and Refill). If we are unable to generate consumer adoption of our Dispensers, we will face significant difficulties growing sales of Exchange and Refill, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe markets for our products are evolving rapidly and we may not be able to accurately assess the size of the markets or trends that may emerge and affect our businesses. Consumer preference can change due to a variety of factors, including social trends, negative publicity and economic changes. If we are unable to convince current and potential retail customers and individual consumers of the advantages of our products, our ability to sell our products will be limited. Consumer acceptance also will affect, and be affected by, our existing retail partners\u2019 and potential new retail partners\u2019 decisions to sell our products and their perception of the likelihood of consumers purchasing our products. Even if retail customers purchase our products, there is no guarantee that they will be successful in selling our products to consumers on a scale necessary for us to achieve sustained profitability and growth. Any significant changes in consumer preferences for purified bottled water could result in reduced demand for our products and erosion of our competitive and financial position.\nWe may not fully realize expected growth in Refill sales volume and net sales from the insights discovered in the third quarter of 2018 related to downtime of certain Glacier Refill machines, including the extent to which the previously announced implementation of credit card reader technology on our Refill machines will permanently resolve related downtime issues going forward, as well as the potential difficulties retaining and growing the portion of our customer base targeted by such Refill machines.\nIn connection with the implementation of new technology in the third quarter of 2018 and the application of our \u201cas-needed\u201d service model to the legacy Glacier outdoor, coin-based Refill machines, we discovered that a number of such Refill machines were only identified as out-of-service upon the next occurrence of the \u201cas-needed\u201d servicing, which led to a lack of visibility to quickly identify machines experiencing downtime. Data showed us that, more often than not, we did not receive any notification from a retailer or customer that any downtime had occurred until such malfunctioning machines were identified on the next regularly scheduled service visit.\nWe have implemented a number of changes arising from such issues that we believe will help drive incremental, sustainable and long-term growth in our Refill business. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into a partnership with Nayax, a leading cashless payment solutions provider, where we will install Nayax\u2019s credit card payment processing technology on approximately 17,000 of our outdoor Refill machines. We believe that this credit card payment processing technology, in addition to providing our customers with increased payment options, will provide us the ability to remotely monitor our outdoor Refill machines in real time and ensure they are in continuous operation. In addition, in 2018 we commenced implementation of a broad-based increase in price in our Refill segment, and we believe this price increase may further support the incremental, sustainable and long-term growth in our Refill business along with our other proposed solutions.\nHowever, there can be no assurances that our proposed solutions to the Refill machine downtime visibility issues, including the implementation of the Nayax credit card payment solution, will permanently resolve such downtime visibility issues. These solutions and related benefits may not be achieved within our anticipated time frame, or at all, and at the costs and expenses we currently expect. In the event that our proposed solutions do not adequately resolve such downtime visibility issues, we may not fully realize the expected growth in Refill sales volume and net sales, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, extended downtime of our legacy Glacier outdoor, coin-based Refill machines may have prevented sales to current or prospective customers, and may have impaired relationships with existing customers or prevented us from establishing relationships with new customers. If our proposed solutions do not achieve the expected benefits, we may experience a decrease in our Refill customer base targeted by such machines or fail to achieve previously expected Refill customer base growth in respect of such machines, which may adversely affect our volume and net sales, which may impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our recently commenced increase in price in our Refill segment may result in a decrease in the sales volume of our Refill products to an extent that the increase in price will not offset such decrease in volume, or may otherwise negatively impact growth in our Refill business or otherwise inhibit the growth in our Refill business that the previously discussed solutions are meant to achieve. Any such further negative impact or inhibition of the growth in our Refill business would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, face competition from companies with far greater resources than we have and could encounter significant competition from these companies both in Exchange and Refill.\nWe primarily participate in the highly competitive bottled water segment of the non-alcoholic beverage industry. The industry is dominated by large and well-known international companies, and numerous smaller firms are also seeking to establish market niches. In Exchange, we offer three- and five-gallon bottled water and also provide consumers the ability to exchange their used containers. Competitive factors with respect to our business include pricing, taste, advertising, sales promotion programs, product innovation, increased efficiency in production and distribution techniques, the introduction of new packaging and brand and trademark development and protection.\nOur primary competitors in our Exchange business include Nestl\u00e9, The Coca-Cola Company, PepsiCo, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group and Cott Corporation. Many of these competitors are leading consumer products companies, have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do, have established a strong brand presence with consumers and have established relationships with retailers, manufacturers, bottlers and distributors necessary to start an exchange business at retail locations nationwide should they decide to do so. Competitors with greater financial resources may put pressure on the prices at which we offer our products which would have a negative impact on our margins. Further, in 2018 we commenced implementation of a broad-based increase in price in our Refill segment. Any such increases for our Refill products or any of our other products, may decrease our overall sales volume, including a decrease in the sales volume of our Refill products to an extent that the increase in price will not offset such decrease in volume, any of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition to competition between companies within the bottled water industry, the industry itself faces significant competition from other non-alcoholic beverages, including carbonated and non-carbonated soft drinks and waters, juices, sport and energy drinks, coffees, teas and spring and tap water.\nRefill also participates in the highly competitive purified water segment of the non-alcoholic beverage industry. While the non-alcoholic beverage industry is dominated by large and well-known international companies, numerous smaller firms are also seeking to establish market niches. Refill faces two levels of competition: (i) competition at the retail customer level to secure placement of its reverse osmosis water filtration systems in the store; and (ii) competition at an end-user level to convince consumers to purchase its water versus other options. Competitive factors with respect to our Refill business include pricing, taste, advertising, sales promotion programs, retail placement, introduction of new packaging and branding.\nWe also face competition from other methods of purified water consumption such as countertop filtration systems, faucet mounted filtration systems, in-line whole-house filtration systems, water filtration dispensing products such as pitchers and jugs, standard and advanced feature water coolers and refrigerator dispensed filtered and unfiltered water. We could face enhanced competition if such devices are improved to provide enhanced filtration or other competing services.\nWe also compete directly and indirectly in the Dispenser marketplace. There are many large consumer products companies with substantially greater financial and other resources, a larger brand presence with consumers and established relationships with retailers that could decide to enter the marketplace. Should any of these consumer products companies so decide to enter the Dispenser marketplace, sales of our water dispensers could be materially and adversely impacted, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our sales of Exchange and Refill water.\nWe have incurred operating losses in the past and may incur operating losses in the future.\nWe have recorded an operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2018 and although we have reported operating income for the year ended December 31, 2017, we have incurred operating losses in the past and may incur operating losses in the future. As of December 31, 2018, our accumulated deficit was $328.6 million. We may incur losses in the future as we incur additional costs and expenses related to, among other matters, interest and other costs related to our indebtedness, branding and marketing, expansion of operations, additional strategic acquisitions, product development, development of relationships with strategic business partners, regulatory compliance and litigation. If our operating expenses exceed our expectations, our financial performance will be adversely affected. If our sales do not grow to offset any increased expenses, we may not experience profitability in the future. If we do not achieve sustained profitability, we may be unable to continue operations.\nIn our Exchange business, we depend on independent bottlers, distributors and suppliers for our business to operate.\nIn our Exchange business, we continue to be dependent on independent bottlers, distributors and suppliers to bottle and deliver our bottled water products to our retail customers. We do not have our own manufacturing facilities to produce bottled water products. We are, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, entirely dependent on third parties to supply the bottle pre-forms, bottles, water and other materials necessary to operate our Exchange business. We rely on third-party supply companies to manufacture our three- and five-gallon water bottles and deliver them to our bottlers. In turn, we rely on bottlers to properly purify the water, include our mineral enhancements and bottle the finished product without contamination and pursuant to our quality standards and preparation procedures. Finally, we rely upon our distributors to deliver bottled water to our retail partners in a timely manner, provide us with accurate information regarding the delivery of the bottles, manage our recycling center displays and return used bottles to the bottlers to be sanitized or crushed and recycled.\nWe rely on DS Services of America, Inc. (\u201cDS Services\u201d), a subsidiary of Cott Corporation, to perform the majority of the bottling and distribution responsibilities in our Exchange business and are substantially dependent on DS Services\u2019 ability to provide bottling and distribution services to our retail partners. Should our strategic arrangement with DS Services not be successful or should the strategic alliance agreement not be extended beyond its term, which runs through December 31, 2025, we may be unable to re-establish our relationships with our prior network of independent bottlers, distributors and suppliers or otherwise establish relationships with new third parties as necessary to support existing operations, growth and profitability of our business on economically viable terms. As independent companies, these bottlers, distributors and suppliers make their own business decisions. Suppliers may choose not to do business with us for a variety of reasons, including competition, brand identity, product standards and concerns regarding our economic viability. They may have the right to determine whether, and to what extent and on what terms, they produce and distribute our products, our competitors\u2019 products and their own products. Some of the business for certain of these bottlers, distributors and suppliers comes from producing or selling our competitors\u2019 products. These bottlers, distributors and suppliers may devote more resources to other products or take other actions detrimental to our brands. In addition, their financial condition could also be adversely affected by conditions beyond our control. Any deterioration in the financial condition or operating capabilities of our bottlers, distributors or other suppliers could adversely affect our business. In addition, we will face risks associated with any bottler\u2019s or distributor\u2019s or DS Services\u2019 failure to adhere to quality control and service guidelines we establish or laws or regulations governing their operations or failure to ensure an adequate and timely supply of product at retail locations. Any of these factors could negatively affect our business and financial performance. If we are unable to obtain and maintain a source of supply for bottles, water and other materials of adequate quality and quantity, our business will be materially and adversely affected.\nIn Exchange, if our distributors do not perform to our retailers\u2019 expectations, if we encounter difficulties in managing our distributor operations or if we or our distributors are not able to manage growth effectively, our retail relationships may be adversely impacted and our business may suffer.\nOur success depends on our ability to manage our retail relationships through the performance of our distributor partners, including DS Services. We exercise only limited influence over the resources our distributor partners devote to delivery and exchange of our three- and five-gallon water bottles. Our retailers impose demanding product and service requirements on us and we could suffer a loss of consumer or retailer goodwill if our distributors do not adhere to our quality control and service guidelines or fail to ensure an adequate and timely supply of bottled water at retail locations. The poor performance of services provided to a major retailer by us or our distributors could jeopardize our entire relationship with that retailer and cause our Exchange business to suffer. In addition, the number of retail locations offering Exchange and our corresponding sales has grown significantly over the past several years. Accordingly, our distributors, including DS Services, must be able to adequately service an increasing number of retail accounts. If our growth is not managed effectively both by us and our distributors, our Exchange business may suffer.\nWe may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without dilution to our stockholders.\nAt December 31, 2018, our cash totaled $7.3 million, and we had the $27.0 million available under the revolving portion of the SunTrust Credit Facility. We anticipate that our current cash, availability under the SunTrust Credit Facility and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our current capital needs for general corporate purposes. However, we may need or desire additional capital to finance our operations or to execute on our current or future business strategies, including to expand the number of retail store locations in which our products are offered, enhance our operating infrastructure, acquire new businesses, products or technologies, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures.\nIf we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. In addition, our ability to incur additional indebtedness may be impaired as a result of the significant amount of indebtedness at December 31, 2018. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, when we desire them, our ability to invest in our operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our product offerings, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited and we could be forced to reduce, delay or cancel capital expenditures, sell assets, or scale down our operations, all of which could harm our ability to generate revenues and reduce the value of our common stock.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to recruit qualified personnel, our ability to implement our business strategies could be delayed or hindered. In addition, we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth.\nWe are highly dependent upon the services of our senior management because of their experience, industry relationships and knowledge of the business. The loss of one or more of our key employees could seriously harm our business and we may not be able to attract and retain individuals with the same or similar level of experience or expertise. We face competition for qualified employees from numerous sources and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms. Our ability to recruit and retain such personnel will depend upon a number of factors, such as our results of operations, prospects and the level of competition then prevailing in the market for qualified personnel. Further, as the U.S. economy has generally improved in recent years, labor markets for certain of our personnel have tightened, and the continuation of such conditions or further tightening of such labor markets may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Failure to recruit and retain such personnel could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While our employment agreements with members of our senior management include customary confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation covenants, there can be no assurance that such provisions will be enforceable or adequately protect us.\nWe have Canadian operations and are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and political uncertainties.\nWe have Canadian operations, and as a result, we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Risks inherent to operating internationally include: changes in a country\u2019s economic or political conditions, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements.\nTo the extent the United States dollar strengthens against the Canadian dollar, our foreign revenues and profits will be reduced when translated into United States dollars.\nWe recently entered into a partnership with a third party in Mexico related to Mexico Refill operations, and we regularly evaluate potential expansion into international markets. Such expansion into international operations, and our limited experience in international markets outside of Canada, could subject us to risks and expenses that could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo date, we have not undertaken substantial commercial activities outside of the United States and Canada. We have evaluated, and continue to evaluate, potential expansion into certain other international markets. In January 2019, we entered into an agreement with a Mexico partner creating the framework for establishing a business in Mexico to sell reverse-osmosis water through indoor and outdoor self-service refill drinking water machines (the \u201cMexico Refill Partnership\u201d).\nAs we seek to expand internationally in the future, our sales and operations are subject to a variety of risks, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, tariffs, import restrictions and other trade barriers, unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements, political, economic and civil instability and uncertainty (including acts of terrorism, civil unrest, drug-cartel related and other forms of violence and outbreaks of war), investment restrictions or requirements, longer accounts receivable payment cycles, potentially adverse tax consequences, and difficulty in complying with foreign laws and regulations, as well as U.S. laws and regulations that govern foreign activities, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we might operate, including Mexico, could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact our operations in those areas. Also, as we pursue international expansion efforts, it may be necessary or desirable to contract with third parties, and we may not be able to enter into such agreements on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Further, such arrangements, including the Mexico Refill Partnership, may not perform to our expectations, and we may be exposed to various risks as a result of the activities of our partners.\nIn addition, prior to the Mexico Refill Partnership, we have had very limited experience undertaking international operations outside of Canada. The structuring, expansion and administration of the Mexico Refill Partnership may require significant management attention and financial and operational resources that may result in increased operational, administrative, legal, compliance and other costs and may divert management\u2019s attention and employee resources from other priorities. If we do not successfully manage and expand the Mexico Refill Partnership in a timely manner, if at all, the Mexico Refill Partnership may not generate its currently expected profitability, if any, and we may experience adverse effects on our business, financial, condition, results of operation or cash flows.\nAny occurrences of the risks associated with our international operations and related expansion could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation, reputation and ability to further expand internationally.\nRecently imposed tariffs and other potential changes in international trade relations implemented by the U.S. presidential administration could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Further, any suspension, revocation, expiration, non-renewal or other loss of our recently secured temporary exemption from existing tariffs (including the extension of applicable tariffs beyond the duration of our temporary exemption) could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operation.\nCurrently, all of our Dispensers are assembled by independent manufacturers in, and imported from, China. These import operations are subject to international trade regulations, including import charges and other agreements among the United States and its trading partners, including China.\nThe U.S. government recently proposed, among other actions, imposing new or higher tariffs on specified imported products originating from China in response to what it characterizes as unfair trade practices, and China has responded by proposing new or higher tariffs on specified products imported from the United States. In a notice published on June 20, 2018, the Office of the United States Trade Representative (the \u201cUSTR\u201d) issued a determination and request for public comment under Section 301 under the Trade Act of 1974 (the \u201cNotices\u201d) concerning the proposed imposition of an additional 25% tariff on specified products from China (the \u201cJune 2018 Tariffs\u201d). The list of products set forth in the Notice included self-contained drinking water coolers, including our Dispensers, which we import from China. We have worked with our suppliers and secured a reduction in the amount we pay for Dispensers and with our customers to increase our prices to include the remaining incremental cost associated with the Tariff as implemented in the Notice. We believe the cost reduction and increased pricing will offset the impact of the Tariff as implemented in the Notice, however, if retailers increase prices to consumers, consumer demand may be reduced, and any increases in the rate of the Tariff or any additional tariffs may adversely affect us in a manner where we cannot negotiate cost reductions or price increases to offset any potential impact.\nIn July 2018, we applied to the USTR for a Request for Exclusion from the Tariffs for our Dispensers (the \u201cRequest for Exclusion\u201d). Our Request for Exclusion was granted by the USTR in the fourth quarter of 2018. The exclusion is retroactive to July 6, 2018, and any amounts we paid in respect of such June 2018 Tariffs between the time of their implementation and the granting of our Request for Exclusion will be reimbursed. However, the exemption granted to us by the USTR is temporary and expires after one year from its granting. Any suspension, revocation, expiration, non-renewal or other loss of our temporary exemption from the June 2018 Tariffs, or the extension of the June 2018 Tariffs beyond the expiration date of our temporary exemption, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIn addition, in September 2018, the USTR finalized a new list of products imported from China that are subject to a new 10% tariff, which went into effect on September 24, 2018 and which was scheduled to increase to 25% on January 1, 2019 (the \u201cList 3 Tariffs\u201d and, together with the June 2018 Tariffs, the \u201cTariffs\u201d). On February 28, 2019, President Trump delayed the increase from 10% to 25% to provide time for further negotiations with Chinese trade representatives. While the 10% rate for the List 3 Tariffs currently remains in effect, the rate is subject to the discretion of the President, and the List 3 Tariffs rate may increase at any time without advanced notice as to the timing or magnitude of any such increase. Primo imports a small number of lower-priced products subject to the List 3 Tariffs, and the Trump Administration has stated they will not implement a product exclusion process for products subject to the List 3 Tariffs. As a result, certain of our products remain subject to the 10% List 3 Tariffs, which may increase to 25% later in 2019. The continued implementation of such List 3 Tariffs, and any increase in the duties subject to such List 3 Tariffs, may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThese Tariffs, along with any additional tariffs or other trade actions (including duties, import charges or other similar restrictions or other reductions in trade) that may be implemented, may further increase the cost of certain materials and/or products that we import from China, including our Dispensers, or any other foreign nation from which we may source any goods, thereby adversely affecting our profitability. These actions could require us to raise our prices, which could decrease demand for our products or otherwise impact the marketability of our products to retailers and consumers. The Tariffs could also force us to seek alternative suppliers for our Dispensers and other materials we import from China or force our existing suppliers to establish new manufacturing operations in other countries, and the products produced by such manufacturers may be of inferior quality, cost more than the Dispensers we currently import from China, or otherwise be sourced from suppliers with unproven operations or reliability. As a result, these actions, including potential retaliatory measures by China, may adversely impact our business. Given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of these trade actions by the United States or other countries, as well as the potential for additional trade actions, the impact on our operations and results remains uncertain and could be significant. To the extent that our supply chain, costs, sales or profitability are negatively affected by the Tariffs or any other trade actions (including duties, import charges or other similar restrictions or other reductions in trade), our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nIn the Dispensers segment, because all of our dispensers are manufactured in China, a significant disruption in the operations of these manufacturers or political unrest in China could materially adversely affect us.\nWe have one primary manufacturer of our Dispensers. Any disruption in production or inability of our manufacturers to produce quantities of water dispensers adequate to meet our needs could significantly impair our ability to operate the Dispensers segment on a day-to-day basis. All of our manufacturers are located in China, which exposes us to certain risks including, among others, the possibility of product supply disruption and increased costs in the event of changes in the policies of the Chinese government, political unrest or unstable economic conditions in China, changes in currency exchange rates or developments in the United States that are adverse to trade with China or other nations, including enactment of protectionist legislation or policies. In addition, in some cases, our dispensers are shipped directly from the manufacturer to our retail partners. Although we routinely inspect and monitor our manufacturing partners\u2019 activities and products, we rely heavily upon their quality controls when producing and delivering the dispensers to our retail partners. Any of these matters could materially adversely affect Dispensers and, as a result, our profitability.\nIf the water we sell became contaminated, our business could be seriously harmed.\nWe have adopted various quality, environmental, health and safety standards. However, our Exchange and Refill products may still not meet these standards or could otherwise become contaminated. A failure to meet these standards or contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers, distributors or suppliers. Such a failure or contamination could result in expensive production interruptions, recalls and liability claims. Any widespread product recall, whether or not related to a failure to meet standards or water contamination, could result in losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time or damaged reputation due to negative publicity. Even if our Refill water does not ever become contaminated, a contamination of any vended water, including the water of our competitors, would be detrimental to certain segments of our industry as a whole, which may have adverse effects on our business and results of operation. We could also suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us. Moreover, negative publicity could be generated even from false, unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls. Any of these failures or occurrences, or any allegation of such failures or occurrences, could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nElectrical outages, localized municipal tap water system shut-downs, \u201cboil water\u201d directives or increases in the cost of electricity or municipal tap water could adversely affect portions of our Refill business.\nCertain of our Refill machines depend on a supply of electricity and water to operate. Any electrical outages or cut-off of municipal tap water supplies to such machines or a directive to boil municipal tap water sources for such machines, in each case, whether due to natural disasters or otherwise, would cause us to lose all revenue from the affected machines during that period and could, in addition, lower subsequent revenues if consumers perceive that there is a risk of contamination in our vended water. Additionally, if electricity or municipal water costs were to increase significantly, our Refill retail partners may request that we pay them a higher commission, which, if granted, would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf any component of the Dispensers we sell is misused, the appliance may fail and cause personal injury or property damage. We may be subject to product liability claims as a result of any such failure, which will likely increase our costs and adversely affect our business and reputation.\nAlthough we include explicit instructions for the operation of the Dispensers we sell and safety warnings are included on all of the products we sell, consumers may misuse these products, including by tampering with the hot water safety lock devices, which could expose consumers to hot liquids. The misuse of any of the components of our Dispensers we sell may cause personal injury and damage to property.\nOur product liability insurance for personal injury and damage to property may not be sufficient or available to cover any successful product liability claim, or similar claims, against us, which could materially adversely impact our financial condition. Whether or not a claim against us would be successful, defense of the claim may be costly and the existence of any claim may adversely impact our reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nInterruption or disruption of our supply chain, distribution channels, bottling and distribution network or third-party services providers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability and that of our business partners, including suppliers, bottlers, distributors, retailers and service providers, to manufacture, sell and deliver products is critical to our success. Interruption or disruption of our supply chain, distribution channels or service network due to unforeseen events, including war, terrorism and other international conflicts, public health issues, natural disasters such as earthquakes, fires, hurricanes or other adverse weather and climate conditions, or strikes and other labor disputes, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could impair our ability to manufacture, sell or deliver our products.\nThe consolidation of retail customers and disruption of the retail business model may adversely impact our operating margins and profitability.\nOur customers, such as mass merchants, supermarkets, warehouse clubs, food distributors and drug and pharmacy stores, have consolidated in recent years and consolidation may continue. These consolidations have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power. As a result, we are increasingly dependent on key retailers, which have significant bargaining power. If we fail to respond to these trends in our industry, our volume growth could slow or we may need to lower prices or increase trade promotions and consumer marketing for our products, both of which would adversely affect our margins and our financial results. These retailers may use floor or shelf space currently used for our products and displays for their own private label products. In addition, retailers are increasingly carrying fewer brands in any one category and our results of operations will suffer if we are not selected by our significant customers to remain a vendor. In the event of consolidation involving our current retailers, we may lose key business if the surviving entities do not continue to purchase products from us.\nFurther, the brick-and-mortar retail industry generally has seen significant disruption and declines in recent years due to, in part, the increased utilization of e-commerce options by consumers. Declines in brick-and-mortar retailers, including the closing of physical locations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. In the event any of our retailers are placed into bankruptcy, become insolvent or are liquidated due to economic downturns, global contractions of credit or for other factors, our business, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows may be adversely affected, including as a result of uncollectible accounts receivable from such retailers, in respect of which pre-bankruptcy petition accounts receivable may not be realized and post-bankruptcy petition orders may be reduced or cancelled.\nMoreover, our Refill business relies on such retailers to serve as partners to access consumers. Continued consolidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, closure of sites or disruptions such as strikes or lock-outs could cause our Refill segment to lose access to some consumers, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows\nWe depend on key information technology systems.\nWe depend on our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems to process orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable, maintain distributor and customer information, maintain cost-efficient operations and assist distributors in delivering products on a timely basis. Any disruption in the operation of our IT systems, the loss of employees knowledgeable about such IT systems, the termination of our relationships with third-party IT system partners or our failure to continue to effectively modify such IT systems as business expands could require us to expend significant additional resources or to invest additional capital to continue to manage our business effectively, and could even affect our compliance with public reporting requirements. Additionally, our IT systems are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from, among other things, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, processing errors, computer viruses, hackers, other security issues or supplier defaults. Security, backup and disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to avoid such disruptions or failures. Any disruption or failure of these systems or services could cause substantial errors, processing inefficiencies, security breaches, inability to use the IT systems or process transactions, loss of customers and retail partners or other business disruptions, all of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nA cyber breach, cybersecurity lapse or a failure or corruption of one or more of our key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites, or service providers could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, if we are unable to securely maintain our confidential or credit card information of third parties, or other private data relating to our Company, our employees or any third party, we could be subject to negative publicity, costly government enforcement actions or private litigation, which could damage our business reputation and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on key IT systems, networks, and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools, hardware (including laptops and mobile devices), software, and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided, or used by third parties or their vendors, to help us manage our business. The various uses of these IT systems, networks, and services include, but are not limited to: hosting our internal network and communication systems; ordering and managing materials from suppliers; supply/demand planning; production; retailer and customer management; hosting corporate strategic plans and employee, customer, vendor and other third-party data; hosting our branded websites and marketing products to consumers; collecting and storing customer, consumer, vendor, employee, investor, and other data; processing transactions; summarizing and reporting results of operations; hosting, processing, and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans, and financial information; complying with regulatory, legal, or tax requirements; providing data security; and handling other processes necessary to manage our business.\nIncreased IT security threats and more sophisticated cybercrimes and cyberattacks pose a potential risk to the security and availability of our IT systems, networks, and services, including those that are managed, hosted, provided, or used by third parties, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data and the data of our customers, consumers, vendors, employees, and others. If the IT systems, networks, or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or if we suffer a loss or disclosure of our business strategy or other sensitive information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events to power outages to security breaches to usage errors by employees and other security issues, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage operations and reputational, competitive, or business harm, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. In any of these events, we could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and IT systems, which could require a significant amount of time.\nFurther, if we or any of our vendors experience a data security breach of any kind that exposes or makes public our customers\u2019 debit card, credit card and other personal information, our employees\u2019 private data and Company records and intellectual property, we could be exposed to negative publicity, government enforcement actions, private litigation or costly response measures. In addition, our reputation within the business community and with our retailers and customers may be affected, which could result in retailers electing to discontinue relationships with us or our customers discontinuing their purchases of our products and services or their use of the debit or credit card payment option. Any loss of our ability to securely offer our customers a credit card payment option would make our products less attractive. This could cause us to lose market share and could have a negative effect on our results of operations. In addition, the foreign, federal and state regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes.\nWe are subject to inventory loss and theft of inventory and cash.\nWe are subject to the risk of inventory loss and theft of inventory and cash. We have experienced inventory shrinkage in the past, and we cannot assure you that incidences of inventory loss and theft of inventory will decrease in the future or that the measures we are taking will effectively address the problem of inventory shrinkage. Our business further faces the risk of cash theft. Although some level of inventory shrinkage is a necessary and unavoidable cost of doing business, if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increased security costs to combat inventory theft or the theft of cash, our financial condition could be affected adversely.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of the impairment of intangibles.\nIn accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), we must identify and value intangible assets that we acquire in business combinations, such as customer arrangements, customer relationships and non-compete agreements, that arise from contractual or other legal rights or that are capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged. The fair value of identified intangible assets is based upon an estimate of the future economic benefits expected to result from ownership, which represents the amount at which the assets could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.\nU.S. GAAP provides that intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortized, but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment, and intangible assets that have finite useful lives should continue to be amortized over their useful lives. U.S. GAAP also provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other non-amortized intangible assets for impairment. Absent any impairment indicators, we perform our impairment tests annually during the fourth quarter.\nWe review our intangible assets with definite lives for impairment when events or changes in business conditions indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, as required by U.S. GAAP. An impairment of intangible assets with definite lives exists if the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected is less than the carrying value of the assets. If this measurement indicates a possible impairment, we compare the estimated fair value of the asset to the net book value to measure the impairment charge, if any. The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nWe cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of intangible assets that totaled $78.7 million, net at December 31, 2018. Such events include strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on our customer base, material negative changes in our relationships with material customers and other parties breaching their contractual obligations under non-compete agreements. Future impairments, if any, will be recognized as operating expenses.\nIn the third quarter of 2018, we initiated a process to unify the Glacier and Primo Refill brands under a unified Primo Refill brand. Failure to effectively move forward with a unified Primo brand in our Refill segment, including difficulties bringing the Primo brand to all Glacier Refill locations within our anticipated timeline, may adversely impact our ability to recognize the anticipated benefits and synergies of brand unification.\nIn the third quarter of 2018, we announced our plan to move forward with a unified Primo brand in Refill and discontinue the Glacier brand (the \u201cBrand Unification\u201d), which we currently expect to complete by the end of 2020. Our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and enhance a unified Primo Refill brand following the Brand Unification, and we believe that a unified Primo Refill brand will be critical in achieving success in our proposed marketing initiatives. The Brand Unification and subsequent efforts to maintain and enhance the unified brand may require us to make significant investments of time, money and resources, including the utilization of significant resources to change the Glacier branding some or all of which ultimately may not be successful. If we fail to effectively unify the Primo Refill brand and Glacier Refill brand in connection with the Brand Unification on the expected timeline, or not at all, or if we incur excessive costs in doing so, we may fail to recognize the anticipated benefits and synergies of the Brand Unification, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nOur anticipated growth in net sales is dependent in part upon our ability to effectively implement certain strategic marketing and brand activation strategies. If any such strategies are ineffective, we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of such strategies, including increased sales volume, net sales and customer loyalty. In addition, we may incur significant and unanticipated costs, resources and time associated with the development and implementation of new marketing and brand activation strategies in the event our currently proposed strategies are not effective.\nAn important part of our overall strategic plan is the development and implementation of new marketing and brand activation strategies in order to increase awareness of the healthy and environmentally-friendly aspects of our products and the risks associated with consumption of tap water, and to drive increased sales and customer loyalty. Such initiatives include, among others, new display advertising, television, print and radio marketing, social media and email communications.\nThese new marketing and brand activation initiatives may not succeed for a variety of reasons, including our inability to execute and implement such initiatives. In addition, these initiatives may become increasingly expensive and divert significant time, costs and resources, and generating a meaningful return on these initiatives may be difficult. Even if we successfully increase our net sales as a result of these initiatives, such increase may not offset the additional marketing expenses we may incur. Any failure to effectively implement any of these new marketing and brand activation strategies on the proposed timeline, if at all, and on the expected costs may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, in the event one or more of these marketing and brand activation initiatives is not effective and we are required to develop new initiatives, such development may further increase our marketing costs and expenses and divert management\u2019s time and resources, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to build and maintain our brand image and corporate reputation, our business may suffer.\nOur success depends on our ability to build and maintain the brand image for our existing products, successfully complete the Brand Unification and effectively build the brand image for any new products. We cannot assure you, however, that any additional expenditures on advertising and marketing will have the desired impact on our products\u2019 brand image and on consumer preferences. Actual or perceived product quality issues or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of our brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. Allegations of product defects or product contamination, even if untrue, may require us from time to time to recall a product from all of the markets in which the affected product was distributed. Product recalls would negatively affect our profitability and brand image. Also, adverse publicity surrounding water usage and any campaigns by activists attempting to connect our system to environmental issues, water shortages or workplace or human rights violations in certain developing countries in which we or our business partners operate, could negatively affect our overall reputation and our products\u2019 acceptance by consumers.\nAdverse weather conditions could negatively impact our business.\nUnseasonable or unusual weather, including hurricanes, may negatively impact demand for our products. The sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Unusually cool or rainy weather may reduce temporarily the demand for our products and contribute to lower sales, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods. Further, significant weather events such as hurricanes may force certain of our Refill locations to shut down, potentially for extended periods of time, or may otherwise cause damage to those Refill locations located outside.\nWater scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact our long-term profitability.\nWater is a limited resource facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, population growth, increasing pollution, poor management and climate change. As demand for water continues to increase and as water becomes scarcer and the quality of available water deteriorates, our business may incur increasing costs or face capacity constraints which could adversely affect our profitability or net sales in the long run.\nOur financial results and achievement of our growth strategy is dependent on our continued innovation and the successful development and launch of new products and product extensions.\nAchievement of our growth strategy is dependent, among other things, on our ability to extend the product offerings of our existing brands and introduce innovative new products. Although we devote significant focus to the development of new products, we may not be successful in developing innovative new products or our new products may not be commercially successful. Our financial results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our ability to effectively gauge the direction of our key marketplaces and successfully identify, develop, manufacture, market and sell new or improved products in these changing marketplaces. In addition, our introduction of new products or product extensions may generate litigation or other legal proceedings against us by competitors claiming infringement of their intellectual property or other rights, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe may pursue acquisitions and investments in new product lines, businesses or technologies that involve numerous risks, which could disrupt our business or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may in the future acquire or invest in new product lines, businesses or technologies to expand our current products. Acquisitions present a number of potential risks and challenges that could disrupt our business operations, increase our operating costs or capital expenditure requirements and reduce the value of the acquired product line, business or technology. For example, if we identify an acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully negotiate or finance the acquisition on favorable terms or at all. The process of negotiating acquisitions and integrating acquired products, services, technologies, personnel or businesses might result in significant transaction costs, operating difficulties or unexpected expenditures and might require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business. If we are successful in consummating an acquisition, we may not be able to integrate the acquired product line, business or technology into our existing business and products and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. Furthermore, potential acquisitions and investments may divert our management\u2019s attention, require considerable cash outlays and require substantial additional expenses that could harm our existing operations and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. To complete future acquisitions, we may issue equity securities, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or incur amortization expenses and write-downs of acquired assets, any of which could dilute the interests of our stockholders or adversely affect our profitability or cash flow. Further, our ability to complete future acquisitions may be limited to the extent our ability to incur additional indebtedness to finance such acquisitions is limited by our existing indebtedness.\nEconomic conditions and other economic and political factors could impact our business adversely in various respects.\nA slowdown in the U.S. or global economy or other economic and political factors affecting disposable consumer income, such as employment levels, inflation, business conditions, fuel and energy costs, consumer debt levels, lack of available credit, interest rates, and tax rates, may affect our business adversely by reducing overall consumer spending or by shifting the purchasing habits of our target consumers, both of which could result in lower net sales, decreases in inventory turnover or a reduction in profitability due to lower margins. Specifically, meaningful increases in the price of fuel could increase the cost associated with servicing vending machines, including those acquired in connection with the Acquisition. The current global economic uncertainty, the impact of recessions, and the potential for failures or realignments of financial institutions and the related impact on available credit may impact our suppliers, our distributors, our retail customers, and our operations in an adverse manner including, but not limited to, the inability of our retail customers to timely pay their obligations to us, thus reducing our cash flow, increased costs related to our distribution channels, the inability of our vendors to timely supply materials and an increased likelihood that our lender may be unable to honor its commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility.\nActivist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business.\nActions of activist stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business. If activist stockholder activities ensue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to proxy contests and reacting to other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, distract our operations and divert the attention and resources of our management and employees. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our strategic future may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, damage to our brand and reputation, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified directors, personnel and business partners. These actions could also cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility based, in part, on speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. Activist stockholders may in the future make strategic proposals, suggestions or requests, including the nomination of director candidates and requests or demands for sales of all or substantial portions of our business, changes to our business strategy, adoption of corporate governance reforms, or other matters. In addition, if individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda different from ours, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our strategic plan and create additional value for our stockholders. We cannot predict, and no assurances can be given, as to the outcome or timing of any consequences arising from these actions or our responses to any of them, and any such consequences may adversely impact our business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations or value of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Regulatory and Legal Issues\nOur products are heavily regulated in the United States and Canada. If we are unable to continue to comply with applicable regulations and standards in any jurisdiction, we might not be able to sell our products in that jurisdiction or they could be recalled, and our business could be seriously harmed.\nThe production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States are subject to regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the \u201cFDCA\u201d), and by other regulatory authorities under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Lanham Act and various environmental statutes. In Canada, these activities are subject to regulation by Health Canada (\u201cHC\u201d) and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (the \u201cCFIA\u201d) under the Canadian Food and Drugs Act. We are also subject to various other federal, state, provincial and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, promotion, labeling and ingredients of such products. For example, measures have been enacted in various localities and states that require a deposit to be charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other deposit, recycling or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in various jurisdictions. We anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at the local, state and federal levels.\nThe FDA regulates bottled water as a food under the FDCA. Our bottled water must meet FDA and CFIA requirements of safety for human consumption, identity, quality and labeling. Further, any claims we make in marketing our products, such as claims related to the beneficial health effects of drinking water, are subject to FDA\u2019s and Canadian Competition Bureau\u2019s advertising and promotion requirements and restrictions. In addition, the FDA and HC have established current good manufacturing practices, regulations which govern the facilities, methods, practices and controls used for the processing, bottling and distribution of bottled drinking water. We are subject to additional or changing requirements under the recently enacted Federal Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011, which requires among other things, that food facilities conduct contamination hazard analyses, implement risk-based preventive controls and develop track and trace capabilities. We and our third-party bottling and distribution partners are subject to these requirements. In addition, all public drinking water must meet Environmental Protection Agency standards established under the Safe Drinking Water Act for mineral and chemical concentration and drinking water quality and treatment. We also must comply with overlapping and, in some cases, inconsistent state regulations in a variety of areas. These state-level regulations, among other things, set standards for approved water sources and the information that must be provided and the basis on which any therapeutic claims for water may be made. In Canada, we are subject to similar regulations administered by HC and the CFIA, as well as provincial authorities. We must expend resources to continuously monitor national, state and provincial legislative and regulatory activities in order to identify and ensure compliance with laws and regulations that apply to our bottled water business in each state and province in which we operate.\nAdditionally, the manufacture, sale and use of resins used to make water bottles are subject to regulation by the FDA and HC. These regulations relate to substances used in food packaging materials, not with specific finished food packaging products. Our beverage containers are deemed to be in compliance with FDA regulations if the components used in the containers: (i) are approved by the FDA and HC as indirect food additives for their intended uses and comply with the applicable FDA indirect food additive regulations; (ii) are the subject of an effective Food Contact Substance Notification under Section 409(h) of the FDCA; (iii) are exempt from regulation under the FDA\u2019s Threshold of Regulation Process; or (iv) are generally recognized as safe for their intended uses and are of suitable purity for those intended uses.\nFurther, certain of our Refill operations, including those acquired in connection with the Acquisition, require us to obtain licenses from regulators for our businesses and machines, to pay annual license and inspection fees, to comply with certain detailed design and quality standards regarding the vending machines and the vended water and ice, and to continuously control the quality of the vended water and ice. Certain Refill machines, including those acquired in connection with the Acquisition, are subject to routine and random regulatory quality inspections.\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission, FDA, HC, CFIA or other applicable regulatory bodies may require the recall, repair or replacement of our products if those products are found not to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations. The failure of our third party manufacturers or bottlers to produce merchandise that adheres to our quality control standards could damage our reputation and lead to customer litigation against us. If our manufacturers or distributors are unable or unwilling to recall products failing to meet our quality standards, we may be required to remove merchandise or recall those products at a substantial cost to us. We may be unable to recover costs related to product recalls.\nWe believe that our self-imposed standards meet or exceed those set by federal, state, provincial and local regulations. In addition, we voluntarily comply with the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s \u201cGreen Guides\u201d concerning the making of environmental claims in marketing materials. Nevertheless, our failure or the failure of our suppliers, bottlers, distributors or third-party service providers to comply with federal, state, provincial or local laws, rules or regulations could subject us to potential governmental enforcement action for violation of such regulations, which could result in warning letters, fines, product recalls or seizures, civil or criminal penalties and/or temporary or permanent injunctions, each of which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our failure, or even our perceived failure, to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations could cause retailers and others to determine not to do business with us or reduce the amount of business they do with us.\nThere can be no assurance that we will comply with all applicable laws and regulations to which we and our products are subject. If we fail to comply, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and reputation.\nLitigation or legal proceedings, including product liability claims, could expose us to significant liabilities, occupy a significant amount of our management\u2019s time and attention and damage our reputation.\nWe are from time to time party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings. We evaluate these claims and proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. If our products are not properly manufactured or designed, personal injuries or property damage could result, which could subject us to claims for damages. In addition, claims made or threatened by our bottlers, distributors and other suppliers could adversely affect our relationships, damage our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The costs associated with defending product liability and other claims, and the payment of damages, could be substantial. Our reputation could also be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful.\nWe may establish reserves as appropriate based upon assessments and estimates in accordance with our accounting policies in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We base our assessments, estimates and disclosures on the information available to us at the time and rely on legal and management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from assessments and estimates. Actual settlements, judgments or resolutions of these claims or proceedings may negatively affect our business and financial performance. A successful claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our available insurance limits could require us to make significant payments of damages and could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property, or our involvement in damaging and disruptive intellectual property litigation, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition or result in the loss of use of products or services.\nWe have filed certain patent applications and trademark registration applications and intend to seek additional patents, to develop additional trademarks and seek federal registrations for such trademarks and to develop other intellectual property. We consider our Primo name and related trademarks and our other intellectual property to be valuable to our business, including the establishment of a national branded bottled water exchange program. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and other arrangements to protect our proprietary rights and could incur substantial expense to enforce our rights under such laws. A number of other companies, however, use trademarks similar or identical to the Primo\u00ae mark to identify their products, and we may not be able to stop these other companies from using such trademarks.\nThe trade name and trademarks \u201cGlacier Water\u201d and \u201cGlacier Water & Penguin Design\u201d previously used by Glacier contain the word \u201cGlacier,\u201d which is commonly used and has been registered in connection with other marks and designs by a number of other entities for water and related services. The mark \u201cGlacier Water,\u201d by itself, is considered by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to be generic in relation to water and related services. We believe that no party can claim exclusive rights to \u201cGlacier Water,\u201d and we may only claim rights to stylized forms of the mark or the mark with design elements. We can, however, give no assurance that other entities might not assert superior or exclusive rights to the marks and seek to obtain damages or injunctive relief against us. Therefore, there can be no assurance that our use of the trade name and trademarks \u201cGlacier Water\u201d and \u201cGlacier Water & Penguin Design\u201d will not violate the proprietary rights of others, which could result in a material adverse effect on us. Further, in the third quarter of 2018, we announced our plan to move forward with a unified Primo brand in Refill and discontinue the Glacier brand, and we plan to cease use of the Glacier brand throughout our operations by the end of 2020.\nThe requirement to change any of our trademarks, service marks or trade names could entail significant expense and result in the loss of any goodwill associated with that trademark, service mark or trade name. While we have filed, and intend to file in the future, patent applications, where appropriate, and to pursue such applications with the patent authorities, we cannot be sure that patents will be issued on such applications or that any issued patents will not be successfully contested by third parties. Also, since issuance of a patent does not prevent other companies from using alternative, non-infringing technology or designs, we cannot be sure that any issued patents, or patents that may be issued to others and licensed to us, will provide significant or any commercial protection, especially as new competitors enter the market.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets and other non-patented proprietary information relating to our product development, business processes and operating activities. We seek to protect this information through appropriate efforts to maintain its secrecy, including confidentiality agreements. We cannot be sure that these efforts will be successful or that confidentiality agreements will not be breached. We also cannot be sure that we would have adequate remedies for any breach of such agreements or other misappropriation of our trade secrets, or that our trade secrets and proprietary know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others. Our failure to successfully develop intellectual property, or to successfully obtain, maintain and enforce patents, trademarks and other intellectual property, could affect our ability to distinguish our products from those of our competitors and could cause our sales to suffer.\nWhere necessary, we may initiate litigation to enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights. Any such litigation may require us to spend a substantial amount of time and money and could distract management from its day-to-day operations. Moreover, there is no assurance that we will be successful in any such litigation or that such litigation will not result in successful counterclaims or challenges to the validity of our intellectual property rights.\nOur business and our ability to provide products and services may be impaired by claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights characterize the consumer products industry. These traits can result in significant, protracted and materially expensive litigation. In addition, parties making infringement and other claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide our products, services or utilize our business methods and could cause us to pay substantial damages. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may need to obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may not be available at a reasonable cost, or at all. It is possible that our intellectual property rights may not be valid or that we may infringe existing or future proprietary rights of others. Any successful infringement claims could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or selling products, providing services and utilizing business methods and require us to redesign or, in the case of trademark claims, re-brand some or all of our products and offerings, products or services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe three- and five-gallon polycarbonate plastic bottles that we use to bottle our water and sell in connection with our exchange business, other than those distributed and sold in California, contain bisphenol A (\u201cBPA\u201d), a chemical that can possibly have adverse health effects on consumers, particularly young children. Any significant change in state, provincial or federal legislation, government regulation or perception by our customers of polycarbonate plastic in food and beverage products could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nOur three- and five-gallon polycarbonate plastic bottles, other than those distributed and sold in California, contain BPA. The use of BPA in food packaging materials has been subject to safety assessments by several international, federal and state authorities. The FDA\u2019s most recent statement on the use of BPA in Food Contact Applications on the FDA\u2019s website states that \u201cFDA\u2019s current perspective, based on its most recent safety assessment, is that BPA is safe at the current levels occurring in food. Based on FDA\u2019s ongoing safety review of scientific evidence, the available information continues to support the safety of BPA for the currently approved uses in food containers and packaging.\u201d In the fall of 2014, FDA experts from across the agency, specializing in toxicology, analytical chemistry, endocrinology, epidemiology, and other fields, completed a four-year review of more than 300 scientific studies. The FDA review did not find any information in the evaluated studies to prompt a revision of FDA\u2019s safety assessment of BPA in food packaging at the time of the review.\nHC's Food Directorate has concluded that the current dietary exposure to BPA through food packaging uses is not expected to pose a health risk to the general population, including newborns and infants. However, due to the uncertainty raised in some animal studies relating to the potential effects of low levels of BPA, the Government of Canada is taking action to enhance the protection of infants and young children. It is therefore recommended that the general principle of ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) be applied to continue efforts on limiting BPA exposure from food packaging applications to infants and newborns, specifically from pre-packaged infant formula products as a sole source food and baby bottles, for this sensitive segment of the population.\nMedia reports and the FDA report have prompted concern in our marketplace among existing and potential customers. It is possible that developments surrounding this issue could lead to adverse effects on our business. Such developments could include:\n\u25cf\nincreased publicity that changes public or regulatory perception regarding packaging that uses BPA, so that significant numbers of consumers stop purchasing products that are packaged in polycarbonate plastic or certain of our key retailers elect to cease offering products packaged in polycarbonate plastic;\n\u25cf\nthe emergence of new scientific evidence that suggests that the low doses of BPA to which consumers may be exposed when using polycarbonate plastic is unsafe;\n\u25cf\ninterpretations of existing evidence by the FDA or other regulatory agencies that lead to prohibitions on the use of polycarbonate plastic as packaging for consumable products; and\n\u25cf\nthe inability of sellers of consumable products to find an adequate supply of alternative packaging if polycarbonate plastic containing BPA becomes an undesirable or prohibited packaging material.\nIn addition, federal, state, provincial and local governmental authorities have and continue to introduce, and in certain states and provinces enact proposals intended to restrict or ban the use of BPA in food and beverage packaging materials. If any of these events were to occur, our sales and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nLegislative and executive action in state and local governments enacting local taxes on bottled water to include multi-gallon bottled water could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nRegulations have been enacted or proposed in some localities where we operate to enact local taxes on bottled water. These actions are purportedly designed to discourage the use of bottled water due in large part to concerns about the environmental effects of producing and discarding large numbers of plastic bottles. While we have not to date directly experienced any adverse effects from these concerns, and we believe that our products are sufficiently different from those affected by recent enactments, there is no assurance that our products will not be subject to future legislative and executive action by state and local governments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in taxation requirements could affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to income tax in the numerous jurisdictions in which we generate net sales. In addition, our water dispensers we sell are subject to certain import duties and sales taxes in certain jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in income and other tax rates could reduce our after-tax income from affected jurisdictions, while increases in indirect taxes could affect our products\u2019 affordability and therefore reduce demand for our products.\nRecent U.S. tax legislation may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nRecently enacted U.S. tax legislation has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. corporations. Many of these changes are effective immediately, without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions. The legislation is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as the issuance of guidance and regulations by the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. In addition, it is unclear how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities.\nWe continue to work with our tax advisors to determine the full impact that the recent tax legislation as a whole will have on us. There may be material adverse effects resulting from the legislation that we have not yet identified. While some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively, other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis. We urge our investors to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to such legislation and its potential effect on their investment in our common stock.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards in the United States may be limited, and we may not be able to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards as a result of recent U.S. federal tax reform legislation.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) of approximately $254.7 million for federal income tax purposes, which expire at various dates between 2019 through 2038, and approximately $169.8 million in state loss carryforwards that expire between 2019 through 2038. To the extent available and not otherwise utilized, we intend to use any NOL carryforwards to reduce the applicable U.S. or state corporate income tax liability associated with our operations. However, our ability to use our NOL carryforwards is based on the extent to which we generate future taxable income and on prevailing corporate income tax rates, and we cannot provide any assurance as to when and to what extent we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets, whether in whole or in part. Furthermore, the use of our NOL carryforwards may become subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) (and similar state provisions) in the event of certain cumulative changes in the ownership interest of significant shareholders in excess of 50 percent over a three-year period. This could limit the amount of NOL carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset taxable income. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of a company immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change and impair our ability to use some or all of our NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income. For these reasons, even if we are profitable, our ability to utilize our NOLs may be limited, potentially significantly so. To the extent our use of NOL carryforwards is significantly limited, our income could be subject to U.S. and/or state corporate income tax earlier and in amounts greater than it would if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards, which could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe value of our common stock could be volatile.\nThe overall market and the price of our common stock may fluctuate greatly. Shares of our common stock were sold in our November 2010 initial public offering at a price of $12.00 per share, and, as of March 1, 2019, our common stock has subsequently traded as high as $20.72 and as low as $0.69 per share. An active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock may be significantly affected by various factors, including quarterly fluctuations in our operating results, changes in investors\u2019 and analysts\u2019 perception of the business risks and conditions of our business, issuance of additional shares in connections with strategic transactions or acquisitions we may make, our ability to meet the earnings estimates and other performance expectations of financial analysts or investors, unfavorable commentary or downgrades of our stock by equity research analysts, and general economic or political conditions.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nAdditionally, we have filed a \u201cshelf\u201d registration statement with the SEC pursuant to which we may sell common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights and units at any time in one or more offerings up to a total public offering price of $125.0 million (inclusive of the approximately $74.8 million of shares of common stock sold by us in our follow-on public offering of common stock in May 2018). The registration statement was declared effective by the SEC on December 19, 2017. The offer or sale of all or a portion of the above described securities may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nConcentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of March 1, 2019, our executive officers, directors and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 8.6% of our outstanding shares of common stock. In particular, Billy D. Prim, our Executive Chairman, beneficially owns approximately 4.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock and also holds an additional 762,146 deferred stock units (each entitling Mr. Prim to one share of our common stock) in our Deferred Compensation Plan, in each case, as of March 1, 2019. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our Company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We currently have research coverage by six securities and industry analysts. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of Primo more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions:\n\u25cf\nauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u25cf\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to act by written consent in most circumstances;\n\u25cf\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to remove a member of our Board of Directors without cause;\n\u25cf\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting of the stockholders;\n\u25cf\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf\nprovide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u25cf\nestablish a classified board of directors the members of which serve staggered three-year terms.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.\nThese anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our Company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could result in a restatement of our financial statements, cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our company and have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to operate successfully as a publicly traded company. As a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nEnsuring that Primo has adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be reevaluated frequently. We may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able or willing to issue an unqualified report if we conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report as required by Section 404, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and our company, which could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock, and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations in the future, which in turn could impact our ability to raise additional financing if needed in the future.", "PERMNO": 12402, "SIC": 2086, "TIC": "PRMW.1"}
