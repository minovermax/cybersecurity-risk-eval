Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves significant risks, some of which are described below. In evaluating our business, investors should carefully consider the following risk factors. These risks and uncertainties summarized above and described below are not intended to be exhaustive and are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Please see page 2 of this Annual Report for a discussion of some of the forward-looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nSummary of the Material and Other Risks Associated with Our Business\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that you should be aware of in evaluating our business, including those described in Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nWe are an early commercial stage biopharmaceutical company, have a limited operating history, have not initiated or completed any large-scale clinical trials, and have a single product approved for commercial sale, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate our current business and likelihood of success and viability.\n\u2022\nWe have incurred significant net losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur significant net losses for the foreseeable future.\n\u2022\nOur ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends significantly on our ability to achieve several objectives relating to the discovery, development and commercialization of our product candidates.\n\u2022\nEven following approval and commercialization of FYARRO for the PEComa indication, we will require additional capital to finance our operations. If we are unable to raise such capital when needed, or on acceptable terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce and/or eliminate one or more of our research and drug development programs or future commercialization efforts.\n\u2022\nWe are early in our development efforts and have only one product which has completed development and obtained regulatory approval by the FDA for a single indication, FYARRO. We are substantially dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, FYARRO. If we are unable to successfully commercialize FYARRO for the PEComa indication or complete development of, obtain approval for and commercialize FYARRO for one or more other indications in a timely manner, our business will be harmed.\n\u2022\nIn addition to FYARRO, our prospects depend in part upon discovering, developing and commercializing additional product candidates, which may fail in development or suffer delays that adversely affect their commercial viability.\n\u2022\nResults from early preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates are not necessarily predictive of the results of later preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates. If we cannot replicate the results from our earlier preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates in our later preclinical studies and clinical trials, we may be unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates.\n\u2022\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment and/or maintenance of patients in clinical trials, our regulatory submissions or receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\n\u2022\nWe have limited resources and are currently focusing our efforts on developing and commercializing FYARRO for particular indications. As a result, we may fail to capitalize on other indications or product candidates that may ultimately prove to be more profitable or to have a greater likelihood of success.\n\u2022\nWe face significant competition, and if our competitors develop and market technologies or products more rapidly than we do or achieve regulatory approval before we do or that are more effective, safer or less expensive than the products we develop, our commercial opportunities will be negatively impacted.\n\u2022\nThe market opportunities for FYARRO and any other product candidates we may develop in the future, if approved, may be limited to certain smaller patient subsets.\n\u2022\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has affected and is expected to continue to affect our business and operations.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to obtain United States approval for FYARRO for additional indications or our other product candidates that we may develop in the future or foreign regulatory approval for FYARRO or our\nother product candidates that we may develop in the future and, as a result, may be unable to commercialize FYARRO or our product candidates and our business will be substantially harmed.\n\u2022\nFYARRO is, and any other product candidate we may develop in the future for which we obtain marketing approval for could be, subject to post-marketing restrictions or recall or withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to penalties if we or our collaborators fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we or our collaborators experience unanticipated problems with FYARRO, or any other product candidate we may develop in the future when and if any of them are approved.\n\u2022\nWe may face difficulties from changes to current regulations and future legislation.\n\u2022\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled executive officers, key scientific personnel and employees.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to establish sales or marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell or market our product candidates, we may not be able to successfully sell or market our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval.\n\u2022\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies.\n\u2022\nOur commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. Claims by third parties that we infringe their proprietary rights may result in liability for damages or prevent or delay our developmental and commercialization efforts.\n\u2022\nIf we do not obtain patent term extension for our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\n\u2022\nThe manufacture of drugs is complex, and our third-party manufacturers may encounter difficulties in production. If any of our third-party manufacturers encounter such difficulties, our ability to provide adequate supply of FYARRO for patients or for clinical trials or any other product candidate that we may develop in the future, if approved, could be delayed or prevented.\n\u2022\nWe depend on intellectual property licensed from third parties and termination of any of these licenses could result in the loss of significant rights, which would harm our business.\n\u2022\nWe contract with qualified third parties for the production of FYARRO for commercialization and expect to continue to do so for additional clinical trials. This reliance on third parties, some of which are sole source suppliers, increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quality and quantities of FYARRO or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\n\u2022\nWe are dependent on a single-source supplier for the drug product FYARRO, and the loss of such supplier could harm our business.\n\u2022\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials, research and studies.\n\u2022\nWe entered into a collaboration agreement with EOC Pharma (\u201cEOC\u201d), and we may form or seek additional strategic alliances or collaborations in the future. Such alliances and collaborations may inhibit future opportunities, or we may not realize the benefits of such collaborations or alliances.\n\u2022\nWe depend on EOC to develop and commercialize FYARRO within the EOC Territory, and we have limited control over how EOC will conduct development and commercialization activities for FYARRO.\n\u2022\nOur stock price is expected to be volatile.\n\u2022\nIf we fail to attract and retain management and other key personnel, we may be unable to continue to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates or otherwise implement our business plan.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe are an early commercial stage biopharmaceutical company, have a limited operating history, have not initiated or completed any large-scale clinical trials, and have a single product approved for commercial sale, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate our current business and likelihood of success and viability.\nWe are an early commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects. We have a single product, FYARRO, approved for commercial sale by the FDA in November 2021 and have not generated any revenue as of December 31, 2021, and we continue to\nincur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biopharmaceutical area. Consequently, any predictions about our future performance may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing biopharmaceutical products.\nTo date, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development activities, business planning, establishing and maintaining our intellectual property portfolio, preparing for commercialization of FYARRO, hiring personnel, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations. Our Phase 2 registrational study of our drug FYARRO (nab-sirolimus) (the \u201cAMPECT trial\u201d) for advanced (metastatic or locally advanced) malignant perivascular epithelioid sarcoma (\u201cPEComa\u201d) has been completed. A rolling New Drug Application (an \u201cNDA\u201d) submission for our lead product candidate, FYARRO, was completed in May 2021, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) accepted our NDA in July 2021 and approved FYARRO for the treatment of advanced malignant PEComa in November 2021. Based on the AMPECT trial and emerging data for FYARRO in other solid tumors with tumor-agnostic Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 1 and 2 (\u201cTSC1 & TSC2\u201d) alterations, and following discussions with the FDA, we opened enrollment for our tumor-agnostic registration-directed trial in cancers harboring TSC1 & TSC2 inactivating alterations in the first quarter of 2022. Our other programs are in early clinical research stages.\nWe have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully manufacture a commercial-scale product, although we have arranged for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conducted sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. As a result, it may be more difficult for you to accurately predict our likelihood of success and viability than it could be if we had a longer operating history.\nIn addition, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors and risks frequently experienced by early commercial-stage biopharmaceutical companies in rapidly evolving fields. We also are transitioning to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome such risks and difficulties, or to make such a transition. If we do not adequately address these risks and difficulties or successfully make such a transition, our business will suffer.\nWe have incurred significant net losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur significant net losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred significant net losses since our inception, have not generated any revenue from product sales to date and have financed our operations principally through private placements of our convertible preferred stock, federal grants and proceeds from licenses. Our net losses were $110.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, and $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We had an accumulated deficit of $142.7 million as of December 31, 2021, and $32.6 million as of December 31, 2020. These losses have resulted primarily from a non-cash impairment charge of $74.2 million related to an acquired contract intangible asset, costs incurred in connection with research and development activities, costs incurred in connection with commercializing FYARRO and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We have only one product approved for commercial sale and have not generated any product revenue as of December 31, 2021, and we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses for the foreseeable future due to the cost of commercializing FYARRO, research and development, including identifying and designing additional product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, and the regulatory approval process for our product candidates. We expect our expenses, and the potential for losses, to increase substantially as we commercialize FYARRO, continue to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates and seek to expand our pipeline. The amount of our future expenses and potential losses is uncertain.\nEven if we succeed in commercializing FYARRO for its approved PEComa indication, and if we succeed in receiving regulatory approval for and commercializing one or more of our future product candidates, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses over the next several years and for the foreseeable future. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our\nworking capital, our ability to fund the commercialization of FYARRO, the development of our other product candidates, our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and the performance of our stock.\nOur ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends significantly on our ability to achieve several objectives relating to the discovery, development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe have one product approved for commercialization in the U.S., FYARRO, for the treatment of advanced malignant PEComa, which was approved by the FDA in November 2021 and launched commercially in the U.S. in February 2022. Our ability to generate substantial product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with strategic collaboration partners, to obtain the regulatory and marketing approvals necessary to commercialize FYARRO in foreign jurisdictions and to successfully complete discovery, development and eventual commercialization of additional indications or one or more of our other current and future product candidates. We do not anticipate generating revenue from product sales significant enough to achieve profitability for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate future revenue and achieve profitability depends significantly on our ability, or any current or future collaborator\u2019s ability, to achieve several objectives, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndemonstrating the safety and efficacy of FYARRO to the satisfaction of the FDA and obtaining regulatory approval for FYARRO for other indications and for other current and future product candidates, if any, for which there is a commercial market;\n\u2022\nlaunching and successfully commercializing FYARRO or any product candidates following any regulatory approval, including the development of a commercial infrastructure, whether in-house or with one or more collaborators;\n\u2022\nmaintaining commercially viable supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that can provide adequate, in both amount and quality, products and services to support clinical development and meet the market demand for FYARRO or any other product candidates we may develop, if approved;\n\u2022\ncompleting development activities, including planned clinical trials for FYARRO for TSC1 & TSC2, successfully and on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nobtaining additional regulatory and marketing approvals for FYARRO for additional indications;\n\u2022\nour ability to complete investigational new drug application (an \u201cIND\u201d) enabling studies and successfully submit INDs or IND supplements or comparable applications, which become effective without any objections by the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities before commencing a clinical trial for any of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nestablishing and maintaining relationships with contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and clinical sites for the clinical development of FYARRO in other indications and any other future product candidates that we may develop;\n\u2022\ntimely receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities for any product candidates for which we successfully complete clinical development;\n\u2022\ndeveloping or contracting for an efficient and scalable manufacturing process for our product candidates, including obtaining finished products that are appropriately packaged for sale;\n\u2022\nnegotiating and maintaining an adequate price for our product candidates, both in the United States and in foreign countries where our products are commercialized;\n\u2022\na continued acceptable safety profile following any regulatory approval of our product candidates;\n\u2022\ncommercial acceptance of our product candidates by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u2022\nsatisfying any required post-regulatory approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nidentifying, assessing and developing new product candidates;\n\u2022\nobtaining, maintaining and expanding patent protection, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;\n\u2022\nprotecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\ndefending against third-party interference or infringement claims, if any;\n\u2022\nentering into and maintaining, on favorable terms, any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements that may be necessary or desirable to develop, manufacture or commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022\nobtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors for our product candidates;\n\u2022\naddressing any competing therapies and technological and market developments; and\n\u2022\nattracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.\nWe may never be successful in achieving our objectives and, even if we do, may never generate revenue that is significant or large enough to achieve profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease our value and could impair our ability to maintain or further our research and development efforts, raise additional necessary capital, grow our business or continue our operations and could cause a decline in the value of our common stock.\nWe will require additional capital to finance our operations. If we are unable to raise such capital when needed, or on acceptable terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce and/or eliminate one or more of our research and drug development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a very time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete. Our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception, and we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing and planned activities, particularly as we seek additional regulatory approval of FYARRO for additional indications, and the commercialization of FYARRO for its approved indications. Our expenses could increase beyond our current expectations if we are required by the FDA, the European Medicines Agency (the \u201cEMA\u201d) or other regulatory agencies to perform clinical trials or preclinical studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate, or if there are any delays in any of our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates. Other unanticipated costs may also arise. In addition, even if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our other product candidates, including additional indications for FYARRO, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution activities and ongoing compliance activities. We cannot reasonably estimate the actual amount of resources and funding that will be necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of FYARRO for the PEComa indication, or for any other additional indications, if approved, or any other product candidates or other indications we may develop. Upon receiving regulatory approval for FYARRO from the FDA in November 2021, we are only permitted to market or promote FYARRO for the PEComa indication, and not for any other indication, or any other product candidate, in the United States. In addition, we will incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in order to continue our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $149.0 million in cash and cash equivalents. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our planned operating expenses and capital expenditures into 2024. Our estimate as to how long we expect our cash and cash equivalents to be able to continue to fund our operations is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned.\nWe plan to use our cash and cash equivalents to fund the commercialization of FYARRO for the PEComa indication, ongoing and planned clinical trials of FYARRO for other indications such as the TSC1 & TSC2 indications, for manufacturing operations and to fund our other research for other product candidates and development activities, as well as for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Advancing the development of FYARRO and any other product candidate will require a significant amount of capital. Our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund all of the activities that are necessary to complete the development of FYARRO.\nWe will be required to obtain further funding to support our continuing operations through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements, collaborations with third parties and licensing arrangements or other sources or a combination of these approaches, which may dilute our stockholders or restrict our operating activities. Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize FYARRO or\nany other product candidates we may develop in the future, if approved. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder and the possibility of such issuance may cause the market price of our shares to decline. Debt financing may result in imposition of debt covenants, increased fixed payment obligations or other restrictions that may affect the conduct of our business. If we raise additional funds through up-front payments or milestone payments pursuant to strategic collaborations with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to certain of our technologies or our product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. Our ability to raise additional funds will depend on financial, economic and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nOur failure to raise capital as and when needed or on acceptable terms would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy, and we may have to significantly delay, reduce the scope of, suspend or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs, clinical trials or future commercialization efforts.\nRisks Related to the Discovery, Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nWe are early in our development efforts and have only one product which has completed development and obtained regulatory approval by the FDA for a single indication, FYARRO. We are substantially dependent on the success of FYARRO. If we are unable to commercialize FYARRO for the PEComa indication or complete development of, obtain approval for and commercialize FYARRO for one or more other indications in a timely manner, our business will be harmed.\nWe are early in our development efforts and have only one product that has completed development and been approved by the FDA, FYARRO, our lead product. Our future success is dependent on our ability to commercialize FYARRO, and to timely and successfully obtain regulatory approval for additional indications for FYARRO. We are investing the majority of our efforts and financial resources to commercialize FYARRO for the PEComa indication and in the research and development of FYARRO for multiple additional indications. FYARRO (sirolimus protein-bound particles for injectable suspension (albumin-bound)), a form of sirolimus bound to albumin, for the treatment of malignant PEComa, as well as other cancer types with mTOR pathway alterations in the TSC1 & TSC2 genes that are most likely to respond to mTOR treatment.\nIn May 2021, we completed the filing of a rolling NDA for FYARRO to the FDA for approval to treat patients with advanced malignant PEComa, and the FDA accepted our NDA in July 2021 and approved FYARRO for advanced malignant PEComa in November 2021. Our NDA was based on results from our AMPECT trial, involving patients for whom there were no approved therapies in the United States. In November 2019, we announced top-line results from the AMPECT trial, including that the study achieved its primary endpoint of objective response rate (the \u201cORR\u201d) as determined by blinded independent central radiologic review using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (\u201cRECIST\u201d). FYARRO will require additional clinical development, expansion of manufacturing capabilities, regulatory approval from foreign regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. where we plan to market FYARRO for malignant PEComa and potentially in additional indications, if approved, substantial investment and significant marketing efforts before we can generate any revenues from product sales. We are not permitted to market or promote FYARRO for non-PEComa indications, before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and we may never receive such regulatory approvals.\nThe success of FYARRO will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and safety of FYARRO in a larger number of patients in a non-clinical trial setting that those demonstrated in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our sales, marketing and distribution efforts, particularly during the remote, COVID-19 environment;\n\u2022\nthe maintenance of existing or the establishment of new supply arrangements with third-party drug product suppliers and manufacturers for sufficient commercial supplies and additional clinical development of FYARRO;\n\u2022\nthe successful launch of commercial sales, including the development of a commercial infrastructure, whether in-house or with one or more collaborators;\n\u2022\nthe timely receipt of regulatory approval for FYARRO from applicable foreign regulatory authorities for advanced malignant PEComa;\n\u2022\nthe successful completion of any clinical trials, regulatory approval and commercialization of FYARRO for one or more label expansion indications;\n\u2022\nthe extent of any required post-regulatory approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of medical professionals to prescribe and patients to use FYARRO and continue to use FYARRO;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u2022\nthe convenience of prescribing, administrating and initiating patients on FYARRO;\n\u2022\nthe potential and perceived value and relative cost of FYARRO;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by private and government payors;\n\u2022\nthe successful and timely completion of the required preclinical studies and clinical trials of FYARRO for current and future indications;\n\u2022\nINDs going into effect with the FDA for our planned and future clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe initiation and successful patient enrollment and completion of additional clinical trials of FYARRO on a timely basis, including the planned registration-directed Phase 2 study (\u201cPRECISION 1\u201d) of FYARRO in patients with tumor-agnostic TSC1 & TSC2 alterations;\n\u2022\nmaintaining and establishing relationships with CROs and clinical sites for the development of FYARRO both in the United States and internationally;\n\u2022\nthe type, frequency and severity of adverse events in clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndemonstrating efficacy and safety profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA and any comparable foreign regulatory authority for regulatory approval obtaining and maintaining patent protection, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;\n\u2022\nthe protection of our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\na continued acceptable safety profile following our current and future regulatory approval;\n\u2022\ncommercial acceptance by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; and\n\u2022\nour ability to compete with other therapies.\nIn addition to advanced malignant PEComa, based on data from the completed AMPECT trial and our ongoing expanded access program, we have initiated a registration-directed tumor-agnostic Phase 2 study, PRECISION 1, of FYARRO in patients with TSC1 & TSC2 alterations. We completed a Type B meeting with the FDA in which we discussed the initial trial design. The PRECISION 1 trial is now open for enrollment in the United States. Our product development costs could increase if we experience delays. Significant trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize FYARRO or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which would impair our ability to successfully capitalize on FYARRO and may harm our business, results of operations and prospects. Events that may result in a delay or unsuccessful completion of additional clinical development of FYARRO include, among other things:\n\u2022\nunexpectedly high rate of patients withdrawing consent or being lost to follow-up;\n\u2022\nfeedback from the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, institutional review boards (\u201cIRBs\u201d), or a data safety monitoring board, or results from clinical trials that might require modification to a clinical trial protocol;\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, a decision by the FDA, other regulatory authorities, IRBs or us, or a recommendation by a data safety monitoring board to suspend or terminate trials at any time for safety issues or for any other reason;\n\u2022\ndeviations from the trial protocol by clinical trial sites and investigators or failure to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nfailure of third parties, such as CROs, to satisfy their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines;\n\u2022\ndelays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of FYARRO to customers or the clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays caused by patients dropping out of a trial due to side effects, disease progression or other reasons;\n\u2022\nunacceptable risk-benefit profile or unforeseen safety issues or adverse drug reactions;\n\u2022\nfailure to demonstrate the efficacy of FYARRO in this clinical trial;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the trials; or\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, or natural disasters and public health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAn inability by us to timely complete clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate substantial product revenues or development, regulatory, commercialization and sales milestone payments and royalties on product sales.\nWe do not have complete control over many of these factors, including certain aspects of clinical development and the regulatory submission process, potential threats to our intellectual property rights and the manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sales efforts of our current or any future collaborators. If we are not successful with respect to one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize FYARRO for multiple indications, which would materially harm our business. If we do not receive regulatory approvals for FYARRO in additional indications or for other product candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nIn addition to FYARRO, our prospects depend in part upon discovering, developing and commercializing additional product candidates, which may fail in development or suffer delays that adversely affect their commercial viability.\nOur future operating results are dependent on our ability to successfully discover, develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize product candidates other than FYARRO. All of our current product candidates other than FYARRO are in research or preclinical development. Prior to initiating clinical trials with our other product candidates, we will need to file an IND or similar application to the FDA or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. We may not be able to file future INDs for our product candidates on the timelines we expect. For example, we may experience manufacturing delays or other delays with IND-enabling studies. Moreover, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing further clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that result in the suspension or termination of clinical trials. Additionally, even if such regulatory authorities agree with the design and implementation of the clinical trials set forth in an IND, we cannot guarantee that such regulatory authorities will not change their requirements in the future. These considerations also apply to new clinical trials we may submit as amendments to existing INDs or to a new IND. Any failure to file INDs on the timelines we expect or to obtain regulatory clearance for our trials may prevent us from developing our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all. A product candidate can unexpectedly fail at any stage of preclinical and clinical development. The historical failure rate for product candidates is high due to risks relating to safety, efficacy, clinical execution, changing standards of medical care and other unpredictable variables. The results from preclinical studies or early clinical trials of a product candidate may not be predictive of the results that will be obtained in later stage clinical trials of the product candidate.\nThe success of other product candidates we may develop will depend on many factors, including the following:\n\u2022generating sufficient preclinical data to support the initiation of clinical trials;\n\u2022obtaining regulatory permission to initiate clinical trials;\n\u2022contracting with the necessary parties to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022successful enrollment of patients in, and the completion of, clinical trials on a timely basis;\n\u2022the timely manufacture of sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials; and\n\u2022\ngenerating sufficient safety and efficacy data to warrant continued development and which are satisfactory to the FDA or any other regulatory authority for marketing approval.\nEven if we successfully advance any other product candidates into clinical development, their success will be subject to all of the clinical, regulatory and commercial risks described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to discover, develop, obtain regulatory approval of, commercialize or generate significant revenue from any additional product candidates beyond FYARRO for advanced malignant PEComa.\nFYARRO or any other product candidates we may develop in the future may not achieve adequate market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success, which would limit the revenue that we generate from our sales.\nEven though FYARRO has been approved for advanced malignant PEComa, and even if any other product candidates that we may develop in the future receive regulatory approval, such approved product candidates may not gain adequate market acceptance among physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of any of our approved product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including, among others:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and safety profile as demonstrated in clinical trials compared to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe timing of market introduction of the product candidate as well as competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which a product candidate is approved;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the use of product candidates in the labeling approved by regulatory authorities, such as boxed warnings or contraindications in labeling, or a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, if any, which may not be required of alternative treatments and competitor products;\n\u2022\nthe potential and perceived advantages of our product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including government authorities or the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party payor coverage;\n\u2022\nthe availability of an approved product candidate for use as a combination therapy;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse effects associated with any approved product candidate;\n\u2022\nany restrictions on the use of our product candidates together with other medications;\n\u2022\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and undergo required diagnostic screening to determine treatment eligibility and of physicians to prescribe these therapies and diagnostic tests;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nunfavorable publicity relating to our product candidates; and\n\u2022\nthe approval of other new therapies for the same indications.\nEven though FYARRO is approved for advanced malignant PEComa, it may never achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payors and patients, and we may not generate or derive sufficient revenue from that product and our financial results could be negatively impacted. Before granting reimbursement approval, healthcare payors may require us to demonstrate that our product candidates, in addition to treating target indications, also provide incremental health benefits to patients. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors about the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nThe market opportunities for FYARRO and any other product candidates we may develop in the future, if approved, may be limited to certain smaller patient subsets.\nCancer therapies are sometimes characterized by line of therapy (first-line, second-line, third-line, etc.) and the FDA often approves new therapies initially only for a particular line or lines of use. When cancer is detected early enough, first-line therapy, such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy, surgery, radiation therapy or a combination of these, is sometimes adequate to cure the cancer or prolong life without a cure. FYARRO for malignant PEComa\nhas been approved as a first-line therapy. Second line therapies often consist of more chemotherapy, radiation, antibody drugs, tumor-targeted small molecules, or a combination of these. Third line therapies can include chemotherapy, antibody drugs and small molecule tumor- targeted therapies, more invasive forms of surgery and new technologies. Our completed and planned clinical trials for FYARRO are with patients who may have received one or more prior treatments. There is no guarantee that product candidates that we develop, even if approved, would be approved for first-line or second-line therapy and, prior to any such approvals, we may have to conduct additional clinical trials that may be costly, time-consuming and subject to risk.\nThe number of patients who have the cancers we are targeting may turn out to be lower than expected. Our projections of addressable patient populations that may benefit from treatment with our product candidates are based on our estimates, which may prove to be incorrect. Additionally, the potentially addressable patient population for FYARRO and other product candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our product candidates. Regulatory approval may limit the market of a product candidate to target patient populations when such biomarker-driven identification and/or highly specific criteria related to the stage of disease progression are utilized. If any of our estimates prove to be inaccurate, the market opportunity for any product candidate that we or our strategic partners develop could be significantly diminished and have an adverse material impact on our business.\nEven if we obtain significant market share for any approved product, if the potential target populations are small, we may never achieve profitability without obtaining regulatory approval for additional indications.\nAny product candidates we develop may become subject to unfavorable third-party coverage and reimbursement practices, as well as pricing regulations.\nThe availability and extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payors, including government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers, managed care organizations and other third-party payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments. Sales of FYARRO or any other product candidate we may develop in the future that receives regulatory approval will depend substantially, both in the United States and internationally, on the extent to which the costs of such product candidate will be covered and reimbursed by third-party payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize FYARRO or any other product candidates that we may develop in the future. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize an adequate return on our investment. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, FYARRO or any other product candidate that we may develop in the future for which we obtain regulatory approval. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, we may not successfully commercialize FYARRO or any other product candidate that we may develop in the future for which we obtain regulatory approval.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products, which would include FYARRO and any other product candidate we may develop in the future for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Market acceptance and sales of FYARRO or any other product candidates we may develop in the future for which we obtain regulatory approval will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by healthcare reform measures. Coverage and adequate reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and commercial payors are critical to new product acceptance. Third-party payors decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. In the United States, for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d). CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS\u2019s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, one third-party payor\u2019s determination to provide coverage for a product candidate does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product candidate. As a result, the coverage determination process is often time-consuming and costly. Factors that payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is: (i) a covered benefit under the health plan; (ii) safe, effective and medically necessary; (iii) appropriate for the specific patient; (iv) cost-effective; and (v) neither experimental nor investigational. This process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each third-party payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.\nIncreasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical product candidates. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs such as FYARRO. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific product candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price (an \u201cASP\u201d) and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely. Further, these prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products. Nonetheless, FYARRO or any other product candidate we may develop in the future may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for FYARRO or any other product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be.\nThere has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to prescription drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024 (the \u201cAmerican Rescue Plan\u201d), the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs will be eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of products, which could have a material impact on our business. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, \u201cPromoting Competition in the American Economy,\u201d with multiple provisions aimed at increasing competition for prescription drugs. In response to this executive order, the HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. In addition, Congress is considering legislation that, if passed, could have significant impact on prices of prescription drugs covered by Medicare, including limitations on drug price increases. A number of states are considering or have recently enacted state drug price transparency and reporting laws that could substantially increase our compliance burdens and expose us to greater liability under such laws once we begin commercialization for FYARRO or, after obtaining regulatory approval, any of our other product candidates that we may develop in the future. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize FYARRO or any other product candidates that we may develop in the future if approved. Complying with any new legislation and regulatory changes could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.\nOutside the United States, the commercialization of therapeutics is generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost containment initiatives in Europe, Canada and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of therapeutics such as FYARRO or any other product candidates that we may develop in the future if approved. In many countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, medical product prices are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after a product receives regulatory approval. To obtain favorable reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of FYARRO or any other product candidate that we may develop in the future if approved to other available therapies. In general, product prices under such systems are substantially lower than in the United States. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for FYARRO or any other product candidates that we may develop in the future if approved. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for FYARRO or any other products that we may develop in the future and receive regulatory approval for may be unavailable or reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits. If reimbursement is conditioned upon our completion of additional clinical trials, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to establish or sustain coverage and adequate reimbursement for FYARRO or any other product candidates that we may develop in the future if approved from third-party payors, the adoption of FYARRO or those other products if approved, the prices of FYARRO or those other products if approved and sales revenue from FYARRO or those other products if approved will be adversely affected, which, in turn, could adversely affect the ability to market or sell FYARRO or any other product candidates that we may develop in the future, if approved. Coverage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Further, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of individuals have lost/will be losing employer-based insurance coverage, which may adversely affect our ability to commercialize FYARRO or any other products candidates that we may develop in the future if approved. It is unclear what effect, if any, the American Rescue Plan will have on the number of covered individuals. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for FYARRO or one or more product candidates that we may develop in the future for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nWe may not be able to obtain FDA approval of any future NDA for FYARRO or any other product candidates we may develop in the future.\nThe clinical development, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, export, import, marketing and distribution and other possible activities relating to FYARRO and any other product candidate that we may develop in the future are subject to extensive regulation in the United States. Prior to the recent approval of our NDA for FYARRO for advanced malignant PEComa, we had not submitted an application for approval or obtained FDA approval for any product.\nApproval of an NDA is not guaranteed, and the approval process is an expensive and uncertain process that may take several years. The FDA and foreign regulatory entities also have substantial discretion in the approval process. The number and types of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for approval varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or the condition that the product candidate is designed to target and the regulations applicable to any particular product candidate. Data are subject to varying interpretation and the FDA may not agree that our clinical data support that any of our product candidates are safe and effective for the proposed therapeutic use. Despite the time and expense associated with preclinical studies and clinical trials, failure can occur at any stage, and we could encounter problems that require us to repeat or perform additional preclinical studies or clinical trials or generate additional chemistry, manufacturing and controls data, including drug product stability data. The FDA and similar foreign authorities could delay, limit or deny approval of a product candidate, and may ultimately approve the product for narrower indications or with unfavorable labeling that would impede our commercialization of the drug.\nApproval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods, including obtaining reimbursement and pricing approval in select markets. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks associated with FDA approval as well as additional, presently unanticipated, risks. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others, including the risk that our product candidates may not be approved for all indications requested and that such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed.\nFailure to obtain marketing approval in international jurisdictions would prevent FYARRO and any other product candidates we may develop in the future from being marketed abroad.\nIn order to market and sell our products in the European Union and any other jurisdictions, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. However, failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may impact our ability to obtain approval elsewhere. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nA variety of risks associated with marketing FYARRO and any other product candidates we may develop in the future internationally could affect our business.\nWe may seek regulatory approval for FYARRO and our product candidates outside of the United States and, accordingly, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including:\n\u2022\ndiffering regulatory requirements in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nthe potential for so-called parallel importing, which is what happens when a local seller, faced with high or higher local prices, opts to import goods from a foreign market with low or lower prices rather than buying them locally;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\ndifficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\npotential liability under the FCPA or comparable foreign regulations;\n\u2022\nchallenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.\nIn addition, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine could lead to disruption, instability and volatility in global markets and industries that could negatively impact our operations. The U.S. government and other governments in jurisdictions in which we may operate in the future have imposed severe sanctions and export controls against Russia and Russian interests and threatened additional sanctions and controls. The impact of these measures, as well as potential responses to them by Russia, is currently unknown and they could adversely affect our business, supply chain, business partners or customers.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations may compromise our ability to achieve or maintain profitability\nThe preclinical studies and clinical trials for FYARRO or any other of our product candidates that we may develop in the future may not demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities or otherwise produce positive results, which would prevent, delay, or limit the scope of development, regulatory approval and commercialization.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval from the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities for the sale of FYARRO for malignant PEComa or any additional indications that we may seek approval for, or other product candidates when approved, we, among other requirements, must complete preclinical development and extensive clinical trials to demonstrate with substantial evidence the safety and efficacy of such product or other product candidates. Each product or product candidate must demonstrate an adequate risk versus benefit profile in our intended patient population and for our intended use. Drug product must also be manufactured and tested in accordance with regional regulatory requirements which may differ from region to region. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and its ultimate outcome is inherently uncertain. A failure of one or more preclinical studies or clinical trials can occur at any stage of the process. The outcome of preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials. In addition, initial success in clinical trials may not be indicative of results obtained when such trials are completed. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical\nstudies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain regulatory approval of their products. Our current or future clinical trials may not ultimately be successful or support further clinical development of FYARRO or any other product candidates we may develop in the future.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or our ability to commercialize FYARRO for additional indications or for any other product candidates we may develop in the future, including:\n\u2022\nreceipt of feedback from regulatory authorities that require us to modify the design of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive clinical trial results that may require us to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon certain drug development programs;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials being larger than anticipated, enrollment in these clinical trials being slower than anticipated or participants dropping out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than anticipated;\n\u2022\nclinical trial sites or our CRO failing to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nthe suspension or termination of our clinical trials for various reasons, including non-compliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that our product candidates have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics or risks;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials of our product candidates being greater than anticipated;\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates being insufficient or inadequate; and\n\u2022\ndelays due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, including starting any clinical trials for other indications or programs.\nFor instance, we do not know whether FYARRO will perform in current or future clinical trials for additional indications as it has performed in preclinical studies or prior clinical trials. Product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, EMA, and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities despite having progressed through preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials. Additionally, while we are aware of several other approved and clinical-stage mTOR inhibitors being developed by multiple other companies, to our knowledge, there are no mTOR inhibitors approved specifically for the treatment of advanced malignant PEComa other than FYARRO. As such, the development of FYARRO and our stock price may be impacted by inferences, whether correct or not, that are drawn between the success of our product and those of other companies\u2019 mTOR inhibitors. Regulatory authorities may also limit the scope of later-stage trials until we have demonstrated satisfactory safety and efficacy results, which could delay regulatory approval, limit the size of the patient population to which we may market our product candidates, or prevent regulatory approval.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety and efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial protocols, differences in size and type of the patient populations, differences in and adherence to the dose and dosing regimen and other trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. Patients treated with our products may also be undergoing surgical, radiation and chemotherapy treatments and may be using other approved products or investigational new drugs, which can cause side effects or adverse events that are unrelated to our products. As a result, assessments of efficacy can vary widely for a particular patient, and from patient to patient and site to site within a clinical trial. This subjectivity can increase the uncertainty of, and adversely impact, our clinical trial outcomes.\nWe do not know whether any clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate consistent or adequate efficacy and safety sufficient to obtain approval to market FYARRO for additional indications or for any other product candidates we may develop in the future. If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product or other testing in a timely manner, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may (i) incur unplanned costs, (ii) be delayed in seeking and obtaining regulatory approval for respective indications, if we receive such approval at all, (iii) receive more limited or restrictive regulatory approval for respective indications, (iv) be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements or (v) have the drug removed from the market after obtaining regulatory approval. Even if\nregulatory approval is secured for any of our product candidates, the terms of such approval may limit the scope and use of our product candidates, which may also limit their commercial potential.\nOur product candidates may cause significant adverse events, toxicities or other undesirable side effects when used alone or in combination with other approved products or investigational new drugs that could delay or prevent regulatory approval, prevent market acceptance, limit their commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences.\nIf our product candidates are associated with serious adverse events or other undesirable side effects or have unexpected characteristics in preclinical studies or clinical trials when used alone or in combination with other approved products or investigational new drugs, we may need to conduct additional studies to further evaluate the product candidates\u2019 safety, interrupt, delay or abandon their development or halt clinical trials or limit development to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Treatment- related side effects could also affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete the trial or result in a more restrictive label, delay or denial of regulatory approval or potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate, could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates and significantly impact our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and generate revenues, and may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. For example, in our AMPECT trial of FYARRO, most treatment-related adverse events were mild or moderate, with the most commonly reported adverse events being anemia, edema, infections, mucositis, pain, nail changes, vomiting, thrombocytopenia, hypertension and nausea. Treatment-related adverse events in our other oncology and PAH trials of FYARRO included thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, fatigue, mucosal inflammation, nausea, anemia, and rash. Additionally, in our first- in-human study of FYARRO in solid tumors, one patient died of dyspnea which was deemed possibly related to FYARRO.\nPatients in our completed and planned clinical trials may in the future suffer other significant adverse events or other side effects not observed or anticipated based on our preclinical studies or previous clinical trials. FYARRO or other product candidates may be used in populations for which safety concerns may be particularly scrutinized by regulatory agencies. In addition, FYARRO is being studied in combination with other therapies, which may exacerbate adverse events associated with the therapy. Patients treated with FYARRO or our other product candidates that we may develop in the future may also be undergoing surgical, radiation and/or chemotherapy treatments, which can cause side effects or adverse events that are unrelated to our product candidate but may still impact the success of our clinical trials. The inclusion of critically ill patients in our clinical trials may result in deaths or other adverse medical events due to other therapies or medications that such patients may be using or due to the gravity of such patients\u2019 illnesses. For example, it is expected that some of the patients enrolled in our FYARRO clinical trials will die or experience major adverse clinical events either during the course of our clinical trials or after such trials, which has occurred in the past.\nIf further significant adverse events or other side effects are observed in any of our current or future clinical trials, we may have difficulty recruiting patients to the clinical trials, patients may drop out of our trials, or we may be required to abandon the trials or our development efforts of that product candidate altogether. We, the FDA, EMA, other comparable regulatory authorities or an institutional review board may suspend or terminate clinical research at any time for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or adverse side effects. Some potential therapeutics developed in the biotechnology industry that initially showed therapeutic promise in early-stage trials have later been found to cause side effects that prevented their further development.\nEven if the side effects do not preclude the product candidate from obtaining or maintaining regulatory approval, undesirable side effects may inhibit market acceptance due to its tolerability versus other therapies. Any of these developments could materially harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nFurther, for FYARRO for advanced malignant PEComa, or if FYARRO receives regulatory approval for any other indication, or if any other product candidate that we may develop in the future if any of our product candidates obtains regulatory approval, toxicities associated with such product candidates and not seen during clinical testing may also develop after such approval and lead to a requirement to (i) conduct additional clinical safety trials, (ii) add additional contraindications, warnings and precautions to the drug label, (iii) significantly restrict the use of the product, (iv) change the way the product is distributed or administered, (v) implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients,\nor (vi) suspend or withdraw the product from the market. We cannot predict whether our product candidates will cause toxicities in humans that would preclude or lead to the revocation of regulatory approval based on preclinical studies or early-stage clinical trials.\nResults from early preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates are not necessarily predictive of the results of later preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates. If we cannot replicate the results from our earlier preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates in our later preclinical studies and clinical trials, we may be unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our product candidates.\nAny results from early preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates may not necessarily be predictive of the results from later preclinical studies and clinical trials. Similarly, even if we are able to complete our planned preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates according to our current development timeline, the results from such preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates may not be replicated in subsequent preclinical studies or clinical trial results.\nMany companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in early-stage development and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, preclinical and other nonclinical findings made while clinical trials were underway, or safety or efficacy observations made in preclinical studies and clinical trials, including previously unreported adverse events. Moreover, preclinical, nonclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses and many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials nonetheless failed to obtain FDA or EMA approval.\nAdditionally, some of our ongoing, planned and future clinical trials may utilize an open-label study design and may be conducted at a limited number of clinical sites on a limited number of patients. An \u201copen-label\u201d clinical trial is one where both the patient and investigator know whether the patient is receiving the investigational product candidate or either an existing approved drug or placebo. Most typically, open-label clinical trials test only the investigational product candidate and sometimes may do so at different dose levels. Open-label clinical trials are subject to various limitations that may exaggerate any therapeutic effect as patients in open-label clinical trials are aware when they are receiving treatment. Open-label clinical trials may be subject to a \u201cpatient bias\u201d where patients perceive their symptoms to have improved merely due to their awareness of receiving an experimental treatment. Moreover, patients selected for early clinical studies often include the most severe sufferers and their symptoms may have been bound to improve notwithstanding the new treatment. In addition, open-label clinical trials may be subject to an \u201cinvestigator bias\u201d where those assessing and reviewing the physiological outcomes of the clinical trials are aware of which patients have received treatment and may interpret the information of the treated group more favorably given this knowledge. The results from an open- label trial may not be predictive of future clinical trial results with any of our product candidates when studied in a controlled environment with a placebo or active control.\nInterim, topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available or as additional analyses are conducted and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose preliminary, interim or topline data from our clinical trials, such as the preliminary data from our completed AMPECT trial of FYARRO in patients with malignant PEComas. The preliminary data is based on a preliminary analysis of then available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. For example, we may report tumor responses in certain patients that are unconfirmed at the time and which do not ultimately result in confirmed responses to treatment after follow-up evaluations. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the topline results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Topline data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. In addition, we may report interim analyses of only certain endpoints rather than all endpoints. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially\nchange as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Adverse changes between interim data and final data could significantly harm our business and prospects. Further, additional disclosure of interim data by us or by our competitors in the future could result in volatility in the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular clinical trial is typically selected from a more extensive amount of available information. You or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular product candidate or our business. If the preliminary or topline data that we report differ from late, final or actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, FYARRO in other indications or any other product candidates that we may develop in the future may be harmed, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAdverse results of clinical trials conducted by third parties investigating the same product candidates as us in different territories could adversely affect our development of such product candidate.\nLack of efficacy, adverse events, undesirable side effects or other adverse results may emerge in clinical trials conducted by third parties investigating our approved product or the same product candidates as us in different territories for the same or different indications. For example, pursuant to the exclusive license agreement (the \u201cEOC License Agreement\u201d) with EOC Pharma (Hong Kong) Limited (\u201cEOC\u201d) for the development and commercialization of FYARRO in Greater China, including the Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (collectively, the \u201cEOC Territory\u201d), EOC has been granted the right to develop and commercialize the same compounds licensed to us, as specified in the EOC License Agreement, including FYARRO, in the EOC Territory and, subject to certain restrictions, to collaborate with others for such development and commercialization. We do not have control over EOC\u2019s clinical trials or development program, and adverse findings from or EOC\u2019s conduct of clinical trials could adversely affect our development and commercialization of FYARRO or the viability of FYARRO as a product candidate. We may be required to report EOC\u2019s adverse events or unexpected side effects to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, which could, among other things, order us to cease further development of FYARRO.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment and/or maintenance of patients in clinical trials, our regulatory submissions or receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials to such trial\u2019s conclusion as required by the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Orphan indications, in particular, have small populations, and it may be difficult for us to locate and enroll sufficient patients in trials for orphan-designated indications. Patient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials. Our ability to identify and enroll eligible patients for clinical trials may be limited or may result in slower enrollment than we anticipate. For instance, patients for our trials for the TSC1 & TSC2 study are screened using genomic information to identify alterations in the TSC1 & TSC2 genes and utilizing such criteria and/or certain highly specific criteria related to the cancer sub-types may limit patient populations eligible for our clinical trials. In particular, because we are focused on patients with specific genetic mutations for certain of our development programs, our ability to enroll eligible patients may be limited or may result in slower enrollment than anticipated. For example, with respect to FYARRO, we cannot be certain how many patients will harbor the TSC1 & TSC2 mutations that FYARRO is designed to target or that the number of patients enrolled for each mutation will suffice for regulatory approval and inclusion of each such mutation in the approved label. We may also engage third parties to develop companion diagnostics for use in our clinical trials, but such third parties may not be successful in developing such companion diagnostics, furthering the difficulty in identifying patients with the targeted genetic mutations for our clinical trials. If our strategies for patient identification prove unsuccessful, we may have difficulty enrolling or maintaining patients appropriate for FYARRO.\nPatient enrollment may be affected if our competitors have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that are under development for the same indications as our product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 product candidates.\nAlso, marketing authorization of competitors in this same class of drugs may impair our ability to enroll patients into our clinical trials, delaying or potentially preventing us from completing recruitment for one or more of our\ntrials. Patient enrollment and retention for our current or any future clinical trials may be affected by other factors, including:\n\u2022\nsize and nature of the patient population;\n\u2022\nseverity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\navailability and efficacy of approved drugs for the disease under investigation;\n\u2022\npatient eligibility criteria for the trial in question as defined in the protocol or as mandated by regulatory agencies;\n\u2022\nperceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022\nclinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages and side effects of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies and product candidates, including any new products that may be approved or other product candidates being investigated for the indications we are investigating;\n\u2022\nthe ability to recruit clinical study investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;\n\u2022\nclinicians\u2019 willingness to screen their patients for biomarkers to indicate which patients may be eligible for enrollment in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\npatient referral practices of physicians;\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain and maintain patient consents;\n\u2022\nthe ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment;\n\u2022\nproximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients; and\n\u2022\nfactors we may not be able to control, such as current or potential pandemics that may limit patients, principal investigators or staff or clinical site availability (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic).\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials could result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Furthermore, any negative results we may report in clinical trials of our product candidates may make it difficult or impossible to recruit and retain patients in other clinical trials we are conducting. Similarly, negative results reported by our competitors about their drug candidates may negatively affect patient recruitment in our clinical trials. Enrollment delays in our clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates and jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates. Furthermore, even if we are able to enroll a sufficient number of patients for our clinical trials, there is a risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion or, because they may be late-stage cancer patients, will not survive the full terms of the clinical trials. As a result, we may have difficulty maintaining participation in our clinical trials through the treatment and any follow-up periods. In addition, we rely on clinical trial sites to ensure timely conduct of our clinical trials and, while we have entered into agreements governing their services, we are limited in our ability to compel their actual performance.\nWe expect to develop FYARRO and potentially other product candidates in combination with other therapies, which exposes us to additional risks.\nWe intend to develop FYARRO and potentially other product candidates, in combination with one or more currently approved or unapproved therapies to treat cancer or other diseases. Patients may not be able to tolerate FYARRO or any of our other product candidates in combination with other therapies or dosing of FYARRO in combination with other therapies may have unexpected consequences. Even though FYARRO has received FDA approval for advanced malignant PEComa, and even if FYARRO receives regulatory approval for additional indications, if any of our product candidates were to receive regulatory approval or be commercialized for use in combination with other existing therapies, we would continue to be subject to the risks that the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities could revoke approval of the therapy used in combination with any of our product candidates, or safety, efficacy, manufacturing or supply issues could arise with these existing therapies. In addition, it is possible that existing therapies with which our product candidates are approved for use could themselves fall out of favor or be relegated to later lines of treatment. This could result in the need to identify other combination therapies for our product candidates, the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions requiring additional clinical trials, or our own products being removed from the market or being less successful commercially.\nWe may also evaluate our product candidates in combination with one or more other cancer therapies that have not yet been approved for marketing by the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. We will not be able to market and sell any product candidate in combination with any such unapproved cancer therapies that do not ultimately obtain regulatory approval.\nIf the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities do not approve or revoke their approval of these other therapies, or if safety, efficacy, commercial adoption, manufacturing or supply issues arise with the therapies we choose to evaluate in combination with FYARRO or any other product candidate, we may be unable to obtain approval of or successfully market any one or all of the product candidates we develop. These unapproved therapies face the same risks described with respect to our product candidates currently in development, including serious adverse effects and delays in their clinical trials. In addition, other companies may also develop their products or product candidates in combination with the unapproved therapies with which we are developing our product candidates for use in combination. Any setbacks in these companies\u2019 clinical trials, including the emergence of serious adverse effects, may delay or prevent the development and approval of our product candidates.\nAdditionally, if the third-party providers of therapies or therapies in development used in combination with our product candidates are unable to produce sufficient quantities for clinical trials or for commercialization of our product candidates, or if the cost of combination therapies are prohibitive, our development and commercialization efforts would be impaired, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe have limited resources and are currently focusing our efforts on developing and commercializing FYARRO for particular indications. As a result, we may fail to capitalize on other indications or product candidates that may ultimately prove to be more profitable or to have a greater likelihood of success.\nWe are currently focusing our resources and efforts on developing and commercializing FYARRO for particular indications and advancing our preclinical programs for certain other product candidates. As a result, because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we may forgo or delay pursuit of opportunities for other indications or with other product candidates that may later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial drugs or profitable market opportunities. Failure to properly assess potential product candidates could result in our focus on product candidates with low market potential, which would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our spending on current and future research and development activities for FYARRO and other programs may not yield any commercially viable drugs. If we do not accurately evaluate the completed clinical trial data, likelihood of future clinical trial success, commercial potential or target markets for FYARRO or any of our other product candidates that we may develop in the future, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate or program through collaboration, licensing or other strategic or royalty arrangements in cases in which we would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate or program.\nWe face significant competition, and if our competitors develop and market technologies or products more rapidly than we do or achieve regulatory approval before we do or that are more effective, safer or less expensive than the products we develop, our commercial opportunities will be negatively impacted.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary and novel products and product candidates. Our competitors have developed, are developing or may develop products, product candidates and processes competitive with FYARRO for advanced malignant PEComa or for any additional indications we may seek approval for, and for any other product candidates that we may develop in the future, if approved. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. We believe that a significant number of products are currently under development, and may become commercially available in the future, for the treatment of conditions for which we may attempt to develop product candidates. In addition, our products may need to compete with drugs that physicians currently use to treat the indications for which we seek approval. This may make it difficult for us to replace existing therapies with our products.\nIn particular, there is intense competition in the field of oncology. We have competitors both in the United States and internationally, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology\ncompanies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, emerging and start-up companies, government agencies, universities and other research institutions. We also compete with these organizations to recruit and retain management, scientists and clinical development personnel, which could negatively affect our level of expertise and our ability to execute our business plan. We will also face competition in establishing clinical trial sites, enrolling subjects for clinical trials and in identifying and in-licensing new product candidates.\nOther than FYARRO, we are not aware of any FDA or EMA approved products indicated specifically for the treatment of advanced malignant PEComa. Patients with malignant PEComa commonly receive chemotherapy regimens and currently mTOR inhibitors including sirolimus, everolimus, and temsirolimus are recommended in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (the \u201cNCCN\u201d) guidelines for treatment of advanced malignant PEComa based on published retrospective data. Following FDA approval, FYARRO was added to the NCCN guidelines as the only preferred regimen for treatment of malignant PEComa. For tumor agnostic TSC1 & TSC2 inactivating alterations, there are no existing FDA or EMA approved products indicated for such use. If FYARRO receives additional regulatory approval for these TSC1 & TSC2 indications, it may face competition from other drug candidates in clinical trials that target the mTOR pathway. These may include dual mTORC1/2 inhibitors in clinical trials or next generation mTOR inhibitors in development. Any potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, drug development, technical and human resources, and commercial expertise than us. Large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in particular, have extensive experience in clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals, recruiting patients and manufacturing biotechnology products. These companies also have significantly greater research and marketing capabilities than we do and may also have products that have been approved or are in late stages of development, and collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions. Established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may also invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make the product candidates that we develop obsolete. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. As a result of all of these factors, our competitors may succeed in obtaining approval from the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities or in discovering, developing and commercializing products in the field before us.\nOur commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, have a broader label, are marketed more effectively, are more widely reimbursed or are less expensive than any products that we may develop and commercialize. Our competitors also may obtain regulatory approval from the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our products, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Our approved product, or product candidates we may develop in the future which achieve regulatory approval, may be priced at a significant premium over competitive products if any have been approved by then, resulting in reduced competitiveness. Technological advances or products developed by our competitors may render our technologies or product candidates obsolete, less competitive or not economical. If we are unable to compete effectively, our opportunity to generate revenue from the sale of FYARRO or any other products we may develop in the future, if approved, could be adversely affected.\nChanges in methods of product candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay.\nAs product candidates progress through preclinical studies and clinical trials to regulatory approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods and formulation, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize yield and manufacturing batch size, minimize costs and achieve consistent quality and results. For example, we may introduce alternative formulations or dosage forms of FYARRO in additional clinical trials for other indications. Such material changes will require regulatory approval before implementation and carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives. Any of these changes could cause FYARRO and any other product candidate that we may develop in the future to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with the altered materials. This could delay completion of clinical trials, require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval\nof our product candidates and jeopardize our ability to commercialize FYARRO or any other product candidates that we may develop in the future, if approved, and generate revenue.\nWe may not be successful in growing our product pipeline through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nWe believe that accessing external innovation and expertise is important to our success; and while we plan to leverage our leadership team\u2019s prior business development experience as we evaluate potential in-licensing and acquisition opportunities to further expand our portfolio, we may not be able to identify suitable licensing or acquisition opportunities, and even if we do, we may not be able to successfully secure such licensing and acquisition opportunities. The licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and several more established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive or necessary. These companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We may also be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment, or at all. If we are unable to successfully license or acquire additional product candidates to expand our portfolio, our pipeline, competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may be materially harmed.\nOur business entails a significant risk of product liability and if we are unable to obtain sufficient insurance coverage such inability could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur business exposes us to significant product liability risks inherent in the development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of therapeutic treatments. Product liability claims might be brought against us by patients, healthcare providers, or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with FYARRO or any other product candidates that we may develop in the future. For example, we may be sued if FYARRO or any other product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability, and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we become subject to product liability claims and cannot successfully defend against them, we could incur substantial liabilities. Product liability claims could delay or prevent completion of our development programs. If we succeed in marketing products, such claims could result in an FDA, EMA or other regulatory authority investigation of the safety and effectiveness of our products, our (or third-party) manufacturing processes and facilities or our marketing programs. FDA, EMA or other regulatory authority investigations could potentially lead to a recall of our products or more serious enforcement action, limitations on the approved indications for which they may be used or suspension or withdrawal of approvals. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may also result in decreased demand for our products, injury to our reputation, costs to defend the related litigation, a diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources and substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients. Although we have obtained product liability insurance coverage, our insurance coverage may not provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities. Furthermore, clinical trial and product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect us against losses caused by product liability claims that could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. The cost of any product liability litigation or other proceedings, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, particularly in light of the size of our business and financial resources. A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could also cause our stock price to decline.\nThe recent global COVID-19 outbreak has affected and is expected to continue to affect our business and operations.\nBroad-based business or economic disruptions could adversely affect our ongoing or planned research and development activities. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to the United States and global economy. Further, infections and deaths related to COVID-19 are disrupting certain healthcare and healthcare regulatory systems globally. Such disruptions could divert healthcare resources away from, or materially delay review by, the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies. It is unknown how long these disruptions could continue, were they to occur. Any elongation or de-prioritization of our clinical trials or delay in regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially adversely affect the development and study of our product candidates. The COVID-19 pandemic caused us to modify business practices (including but not\nlimited to curtailing or modifying employee travel, curtailing or modifying our clinical trials, moving to full remote work, and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events, and conferences). For example, we have experienced, and continue to experience, some clinical development disruptions due to the pandemic, including closures at certain lab facilities, which have led, and continue to lead, to longer than anticipated clinical development times. In addition, our clinical trials have been, and may continue to be, affected by the closure of offices, or country borders, among other measures being put in place around the world. The inability to travel and conduct face-to-face meetings can also make it more difficult to enroll new patients in ongoing or planned clinical trials.\nAs a result of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience disruptions that could severely impact our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials, including:\n\u2022\ncontinued delays or difficulties in enrolling and retaining and adequate number of patients in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ncontinued delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\u2022\ndelays in receiving authorizations from regulatory authorities to initiate our planned clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndiversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninterruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site data monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures, which may impact the integrity of subject data and clinical study endpoints;\n\u2022\nrisk that participants enrolled in our clinical trials will contract COVID-19 while the clinical trial is ongoing, which could impact the results of the clinical trial, including by increasing the number of observed adverse events;\n\u2022\ninterruption or delays in the operations of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which may impact review and approval timelines;\n\u2022\ninterruption of, or delays in receiving, supplies of our product candidates from our contract manufacturing organizations (\u201cCMOs\u201d) due to staffing shortages, production slowdowns or stoppages and disruptions in delivery systems, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\ninterruptions in preclinical studies due to restricted or limited operations at our laboratory facility;\n\u2022\ndelays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees;\n\u2022\nchanges in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may require changes in the ways in which our clinical trials are conducted, which may result in unexpected costs, or to discontinue such clinical trials altogether;\n\u2022\nlimitations on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people;\n\u2022\ninterruption or delays to our sourced discovery and clinical activities; and\n\u2022\nrefusal of the FDA to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies outside the United States.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future liquidity and operational performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, the availability and effectiveness of vaccines, the impact on our clinical trials, patients, and collaboration partners, and the effect on our suppliers.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nIf the FDA does not conclude that our product candidates and/or new indications satisfy the requirements under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, or if the requirements for such product candidates and/or new indications under Section 505(b)(2) are not as we expect, the approval pathway for our product candidates and/or new indications may take longer, cost more or entail greater complications and risks than anticipated, which may delay or prevent the approval of our product candidates and/or new indications for commercial use.\nWe submitted a Section 505(b)(2) NDA to the FDA in May 2021 for FYARRO for the treatment of advanced malignant PEComa, and the FDA approved the NDA in November 2021. We may not be successful in obtaining FDA approval under 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway for other indications or product candidates that we develop.\nSection 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the \u201cFDCA\u201d) was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the \u201cHatch-Waxman Amendments\u201d) and permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from preclinical studies or clinical trials not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The FDA interprets Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA to permit the applicant to rely upon the FDA\u2019s previous findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product. The FDA requires submission of information needed to support any changes to a previously approved drug, such as published data or new studies conducted by the applicant or clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy. The FDA is not required to meet the PDUFA goal date, and the FDA could require additional information to sufficiently demonstrate safety and efficacy to support approval. Moreover, even if any new indication or product candidate is approved under the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may be marketed or to other conditions of approval, or may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product.\nWe may be unable to obtain United States approval for FYARRO for additional indications or our other product candidates that we may develop in the future or foreign regulatory approval for FYARRO or our other product candidates that we may develop in the future and, as a result, may be unable to commercialize FYARRO or our product candidates and our business will be substantially harmed.\nOur product candidates are and will continue to be subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to, among other things, research, testing, development, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, approval, recordkeeping, reporting, labeling, storage, packaging, advertising and promotion, pricing, marketing and distribution of drugs. Rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process must be successfully completed in the United States and in many foreign jurisdictions before a new drug can be approved for marketing. Satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays. we cannot provide any assurance that any product candidate we may develop will progress through required clinical testing and obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for us to begin selling them.\nWe submitted an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) to the FDA in May 2021 for FYARRO for the treatment of advanced malignant PEComa, and the FDA approved the NDA in November 2021. The time required to obtain approvals from the FDA and other regulatory authorities is unpredictable and requires successful completion of extensive clinical trials which typically takes many years, depending upon numerous factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate. The standards that the FDA and our foreign counterparts use when evaluating clinical trial data can, and often does, change during drug development, which makes it difficult to predict with any certainty how they will be applied. We may also encounter unexpected delays or increased costs due to new government regulations, including future legislation or administrative action, or changes in FDA policy during the period of drug development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. It is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nAdditionally, as of March 18, 2021, the FDA noted it is continuing to ensure timely reviews of applications for medical products during the COVID-19 pandemic in line with its user fee performance goals and conducting mission critical domestic and foreign inspections to ensure compliance of manufacturing facilities with FDA quality standards. However, the FDA may not be able to continue its current pace and approval timelines could be extended, including where a pre-approval inspection or an inspection of clinical sites is required and due to the COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions the FDA is unable to complete such required inspections during the review period. In 2020 and 2021, a number of companies announced receipt of complete response letters due to the FDA\u2019s inability to complete required inspections for their applications.\nAny delay or failure in seeking or obtaining required approvals would have a material and adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from any particular product candidates we are developing and for which we are seeking approval. Furthermore, any regulatory approval to market a drug may be subject to significant limitations on the\napproved uses or indications for which we may market, promote and advertise the drug or the labeling or other restrictions. In addition, the FDA has the authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (\u201cREMS\u201d) plan as part of approving an NDA, or after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug. These requirements or restrictions might include limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe-use criteria and requiring treated patients to enroll in a registry. These limitations and restrictions may significantly limit the size of the market for the drug and affect reimbursement by third-party payors.\nWe are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing, among other things, the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process varies among countries, and generally includes all of the risks associated with FDA approval described above as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Moreover, the time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable. If we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will be unable to generate product revenue, and our business will be substantially harmed.\nObtaining approval by the FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities is unpredictable, typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. In addition, approval policies, regulations or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions, which may cause delays in the approval or the decision not to approve an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. Even though FYARRO has been approved by the FDA, and even if we eventually complete clinical testing and receive approval for FYARRO in additional indications or for any other product candidates that we may develop in the future, the FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may approve our product candidates for a more limited indication or a narrower patient population than we originally requested or may impose other prescribing limitations or warnings that limit the product\u2019s commercial potential. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate, and it is possible that none of our product candidates will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nFurther, regulatory approval may be delayed for reasons beyond our control. For example, a United States federal government shutdown or budget sequestration, such as ones that occurred during 2013, 2018 and 2019, or the current diversion of resources to handle the COVID-19 public health emergency and pandemic may result in significant reductions to the FDA\u2019s budget, employees and operations, which may lead to slower response times and longer review periods, potentially affecting our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. In addition, the impact of COVID-19 may cause the FDA to allocate additional resources to product candidates focused on treating related illnesses, which could lead to longer approval processes for our product candidates. Finally, our competitors may file citizens\u2019 petitions with the FDA in an attempt to persuade the FDA that our product candidates, or the clinical trials that support their approval, contain deficiencies. Such actions by our competitors could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any of our NDAs.\nApplications for our product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design, implementation or results of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may determine that our product candidates are not safe or effective, are only moderately effective or have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that preclude us from obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use;\n\u2022\nthe population studied in the clinical trial may not be sufficiently broad or representative to assure efficacy and safety in the full population for which we seek approval;\n\u2022\nthe FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to demonstrate to the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities that our product candidate\u2019s risk-benefit ratio for our proposed indication is acceptable;\n\u2022\nthe FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may find deficiencies with or fail to approve the manufacturing processes, test procedures and specifications or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies;\n\u2022\nthe FDA, EMA or other comparable regulatory authorities may fail to approve companion diagnostic tests for our product candidates, if required; and\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThis lengthy approval process, as well as the unpredictability of the results of clinical trials, may result in us failing to obtain regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nThe FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data from trials conducted in locations outside of their jurisdiction.\nOur clinical trials have been and may in the future be undertaken in the United States. We may choose to conduct additional clinical trials internationally as well. For example, we may conduct our PRECISION 1 trial of FYARRO in the United States, Europe and other countries. The acceptance of study data by the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authority from clinical trials conducted outside of their respective jurisdictions may be subject to certain conditions. In cases where data from United States clinical trials are intended to serve as the basis for regulatory approval in foreign countries outside the United States, the standards for clinical trials and approval may be different. There can be no assurance that any United States or foreign regulatory authority would accept data from trials conducted outside of its applicable jurisdiction. If the FDA, EMA or any applicable foreign regulatory authority does not accept such data, it would result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay aspects of our business plan, and which may result in our product candidates not receiving approval or clearance for commercialization in the applicable jurisdiction.\nBrexit and uncertainty in the regulatory framework as well as future legislation in the United Kingdom (the \u201cUK\u201d), European Union, and other jurisdictions can lead to disruption in the execution of international multi-center clinical trials, the monitoring of adverse events through pharmacovigilance programs, the evaluation of the benefit-risk profiles of new medicinal products, and determination of marketing authorization across different jurisdictions. Uncertainty in the regulatory framework could also result in disruption to the supply and distribution as well as the import/export both of active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished product. Such a disruption could create supply difficulties for ongoing clinical trials. The cumulative effects of the disruption to the regulatory framework, uncertainty in future regulation, and changes to existing regulations may increase our development lead time to marketing authorization and commercialization of products in the European Union and/or the UK and increase our costs. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and future regulation on our business or the results of our operations.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in other jurisdictions.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction. For example, even if the FDA or EMA grants regulatory approval of a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion and reimbursement of the product candidate in those countries. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials as clinical trials conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. The regulatory approval processes in other countries may implicate all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States, as well as other risks. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it\ncan be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products is also subject to approval.\nObtaining foreign regulatory approvals and establishing and maintaining compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. If we or any future collaborator fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets or fail to receive applicable regulatory approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed.\nFollowing Brexit, to the extent we conduct any operations in the UK, we will be subject to applicable regulatory requirements in the UK. Although the UK is no longer a member of the European Union, European Union law remains applicable in Northern Ireland. There are a number of new marketing authorization routes available in the UK, Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) or Northern Ireland, in addition to the national procedure. As with the European Union position, a company can only start to market a medicine in the UK once it has received a marketing authorization. The main legislation that applies to clinical trials in the UK is the UK Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004, which transposes the Clinical Trials Directive into domestic law. Consequently, the requirements and obligations that relate to the conduct of clinical trials in the UK currently remain largely aligned with the European Union position. It is unclear how future regulatory regime in the UK will impact regulations of products, manufacturers, and approval of product candidates in the UK. In the immediately foreseeable future, the UK regulatory approval process is likely to remain similar to that applicable in the European Union, albeit that the processes for applications will be separate. Longer term, the UK is likely to develop its own legislation that diverges from that in the European Union.\nFYARRO is, and any other product candidate we may develop in the future for which we obtain marketing approval for could be, subject to post-marketing restrictions or recall or withdrawal from the market, and we may be subject to penalties if we or our collaborators fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we or our collaborators experience unanticipated problems with FYARRO, or any other product candidate we may develop in the future when and if any of them are approved.\nFYARRO is, and any other product candidate we may develop in the future for which we obtain marketing approval could be, subject to a comprehensive regulatory scheme, which includes the regulation of manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising, marketing, distribution and promotional activities for such product, by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. The FDA has significant post-marketing authority, including, for example, the authority to require labeling changes based on new safety information and to require post-marketing studies or clinical trials to evaluate serious safety risks related to the use of a drug. For example, the FDA may require the submission of a REMS in order to approve our product candidates, which could entail requirements for a medication guide, physician training and communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any REMS required by the FDA may lead to increased costs to assure compliance with new post-approval regulatory requirements and potential requirements or restrictions on the sale of approved products, all of which could lead to lower sales volume and revenue. In addition, if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities approve our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and recordkeeping for our product candidates will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as on-going compliance with current good manufacturing practices (\u201ccGMPs\u201d), good laboratory practices (\u201cGLPs\u201d) and good clinical practices (\u201cGCPs\u201d) for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic, unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations and standards. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, and quality control.\nFYARRO is, and if marketing approval of any other product candidate we may develop in the future is granted may be, subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including the requirement to implement a REMS, which could involve requirements for, among other things, a medication guide, special training for prescribers and dispensers, and patient registries. As a condition of the approval of the NDA for FYARRO, we are required to conduct certain post-marketing requirements (\u201cPMR\u201d) and/or post-marketing commitments (\u201cPMC\u201d). If we fail to comply with the PMR and/or PMC, the FDA may take\nenforcement actions, which may include, among other things, the issuance of a Warning Letter and assessing civil monetary penalties. The product may also be deemed misbranded.\nFYARRO does, and if any other product candidate that we may develop in the future receives marketing approval they may, have a label that limits their approved uses, including more limited subject populations, than we request, and regulatory authorities may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate, which could limit sales of the product.\nThe FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure products are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if we do not market our prodrug products, if any, for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to a number of actions and penalties, including warning letters, cyber letters, or untitled letters, adverse publicity, the requirement for dear-health-care-provider letters or other corrective information, fines and other monetary penalties, civil or criminal prosecution, including False Claims Act liability, restrictions on our operations and other operating requirements through consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, debarment, exclusion from participation in federal health care programs and refusal of government contracts or future orders under existing contracts, among other consequences.\nWe will be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facilities where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. Any new legislation addressing drug safety issues could result in delays in product development or commercialization, or increased costs to assure compliance. In addition, failure to comply with FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory requirements may have negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nadverse inspection findings;\n\u2022\nadditional warnings or otherwise restrict the product\u2019s indicated use, label, or marketing;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our FYARRO products, distribution, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nissuance of warning letters, safety alerts, dear-healthcare-provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings regarding the product that would result in adverse publicity;\n\u2022\nvoluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements or withdrawal of FYARRO from the market;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing or regulatory approvals or other permits or voluntary;\n\u2022\nproduct seizures, detentions or import bans;\n\u2022\ntotal or partial suspension of production;\n\u2022\nimposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u2022\nrequirement to establish or modify a REMS;\n\u2022\nrequirement to conduct post-marketing studies or surveillance;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on drug distribution or use;\n\u2022\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit and other delays;\n\u2022\ndelays in or the rejection of approvals of additional indications for FYARRO;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to conduct clinical trials, including full or partial clinical holds on, or the suspension or termination of, ongoing or planned trials;\n\u2022\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u2022\nreputational harm;\n\u2022\nrefusal of government contracts or future orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal health care programs; or\n\u2022\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, including False Claims Act liability.\nThe holder of an approved NDA or comparable regulatory approval must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority may refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize FYARRO and any other product candidates that we may develop in the future, if approved, and generate revenue. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, the value of the company and our operating results will be adversely affected.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved and we are found to have improperly promoted off-label uses of those products, we may become subject to significant liability. The FDA and other regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, strictly regulate the post-approval marketing and promotional claims that may be made about prescription products, such as for FYARRO. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA or such other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties. As such, we may not promote our products for indications or uses for which they do not have approval. For example, physicians may, in their practice of medicine, use drug products for their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If we, or any of our contractors or agents acting on behalf of us, are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability. The United States federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. If we cannot successfully manage the promotion of FYARRO and any other product candidate that we may develop in the future, if approved, we could become subject to significant liability, which would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIf we are required by the FDA to obtain approval of a companion diagnostic product in connection with approval of any future product in candidates or new indication that we may develop, and if we fail to obtain or face delays in obtaining FDA approval of such companion diagnostic product, we will not be able to commercialize such product candidate intended for use with such companion diagnostic product and our ability to generate revenue form such product candidate will be materially impaired.\nIn connection with the development of any future product candidates or new indication we may develop or work with collaborators to develop or obtain access to companion diagnostic tests to identify patient subsets within a disease category who may derive selective and meaningful benefit from our programs. Such companion diagnostics would be used during our clinical trials as well as in connection with the commercialization of any future product candidates or new indication we may develop. To be successful in developing and commercializing such product candidate in combination with these companion diagnostics, we or our collaborators will need to address a number of scientific, technical, regulatory and logistical challenges. According to FDA guidance, if the FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product or indication, the FDA generally will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic is not also approved or cleared at the same time the product candidate is approved. To date, the FDA has required marketing approval of all companion diagnostic tests for cancer therapies. Various foreign regulatory authorities also regulate in vitro companion diagnostics as medical devices and, under those regulatory frameworks, will likely require the conduct of clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our current diagnostics and any future diagnostics we may develop, which we expect will require separate regulatory clearance or approval prior to commercialization.\nThe approval of a companion diagnostic as part of the therapeutic product\u2019s labeling limits the use of the therapeutic product to only those patients who express certain biomarkers or the specific genetic alteration that the\ncompanion diagnostic was developed to detect. If the FDA, EMA or a comparable regulatory authority requires approval of a companion diagnostic for any future product candidate or new indication that we may develop, whether before or concurrently with approval of such product candidate, we, and/or future collaborators, may encounter difficulties in developing and obtaining approval for these companion diagnostics. Any delay or failure by us or third-party collaborators to develop or obtain regulatory approval of a companion diagnostic could delay or prevent approval or continued marketing of such product candidate. Further, in April 2020, the FDA issued new guidance on developing and labeling companion diagnostics for a specific group of oncology therapeutic products, including recommendations to support a broader labeling claim rather than individual therapeutic products. We will continue to evaluate the impact of this guidance on our companion diagnostic development and strategy. This guidance and future issuances from the FDA and other regulatory authorities may impact our development of a companion diagnostic for our product candidates and result in delays in regulatory approval. We may be required to conduct additional studies to support a broader claim. Also, to the extent other approved diagnostics are able to broaden their labeling claims to include our approved drug products, we may be forced to abandon our companion diagnostic development plans or we may not be able to compete effectively upon approval, which could adversely impact our ability to generate revenue from the sale of our approved products and our business operations.\nAdditionally, we may rely on third parties for the design, development and manufacture of companion diagnostic tests for our product candidates that may require such tests. If we enter into such collaborative agreements, we will be dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of our future collaborators in developing and obtaining approval for these companion diagnostics. It may be necessary to resolve issues such as selectivity/specificity, analytical validation, reproducibility, or clinical validation of companion diagnostics during the development and regulatory approval processes. Moreover, even if data from preclinical studies and early clinical trials appear to support development of a companion diagnostic for a product candidate, data generated in later clinical trials may fail to support the analytical and clinical validation of the companion diagnostic. We and our future collaborators may encounter difficulties in developing, obtaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing and commercializing companion diagnostics similar to those we face with respect to our product candidates, including issues with achieving regulatory clearance or approval, production of sufficient quantities at commercial scale and with appropriate quality standards, and in gaining market acceptance. If we are unable to successfully develop companion diagnostics for any future product candidate or new indication, or experience delays in doing so, the development of such product candidate may be adversely affected, the product candidate may not obtain marketing approval, and we may not realize the full commercial potential of such product candidate after obtaining marketing approval. As a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition, a diagnostic company with whom we contract may decide to discontinue selling or manufacturing the companion diagnostic test that we anticipate using in connection with development and commercialization of any such future product candidate or our relationship with such diagnostic company may otherwise terminate. We may not be able to enter into arrangements with another diagnostic company to obtain supplies of an alternative diagnostic test for use in connection with the development and commercialization of any such future product or new indication. or do so on commercially reasonable terms, which could adversely affect and/or delay the development or commercialization of any such future product candidate we may develop.\nA Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation for FYARRO may not lead to a faster development or review process, or we may be unable to maintain or effectively utilize such a designation. We may also seek additional Fast Track designations from the FDA for FYARRO or any of our other product candidates. Even if one or more of our product candidates receive Fast Track designation, we may be unable to obtain or maintain the benefits associated with the Fast Track designation.\nIn October 2018, we announced that the FDA granted Fast Track designation for FYARRO for the investigation of the treatment of patients with advanced malignant PEComa. This Fast Track designation does not guarantee that we will qualify for or be able to take advantage of the expedited review procedures or that we will ultimately obtain regulatory approval of FYARRO in other indications. Even though we received this Fast Track designation in the past, we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures for other indications for FYARRO. We may also seek Fast Track designation for additional cancer indications or other diseases, and we may not be successful in securing such additional designation or in expediting development if such designations were received. Even if we receive Fast Track designation for additional cancer indications, the FDA may withdraw such Fast Track designation if it believes that the Fast Track designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program.\nFast Track designation is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of therapies intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical\nneeds for the condition. Programs with Fast Track designation may benefit from early and frequent communications with the FDA, potential priority review and the ability to submit a rolling application for regulatory review. Fast Track designation applies to both the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. If FYARRO for any other indication or any other product candidates that we may develop in the future receive Fast Track designation but do not continue to meet the criteria for Fast Track designation, or if our clinical trials are delayed, suspended or terminated, or put on clinical hold due to unexpected adverse events or issues with clinical supply, we will not receive the benefits associated with the Fast Track program. The FDA may withdraw any Fast Track Designation at any time. Furthermore, Fast Track designation does not change the standards for approval. Fast Track designation alone does not guarantee qualification for the FDA\u2019s priority review procedures and we may not experience a faster development process, review or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures.\nIn December 2018, we announced that the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for FYARRO for the treatment of patients with advanced malignant PEComa. We may also seek a Breakthrough Therapy designation for FYARRO for various cancer indications or other diseases. Breakthrough Therapy designation is for a product candidate that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A sponsor may request the FDA to designate our product candidate as a Breakthrough Therapy at the time of, or any time after, the submission of an IND for the product candidate. For product candidates that have been designated as a Breakthrough Therapy, the FDA may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the product candidate; providing timely advice to, and interactive communication with, the sponsor regarding the development of the product candidate to ensure that the development program to gather the nonclinical and clinical data necessary for approval is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the FDA review team to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to serve as a scientific liaison between the review team and the sponsor; and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable, when scientifically appropriate, such as by minimizing the number of patients exposed to a potentially less efficacious treatment.\nThe FDA has broad discretion in determining whether to grant a Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation for a drug. Obtaining a Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation does not change the standards for product approval but may expedite the development or approval process. There is no assurance that the FDA will grant either such designation for any other indication or product candidate that we may pursue. Even if the FDA does grant either such designation, it may not actually result in faster clinical development or regulatory review or approval. Furthermore, such a designation does not increase the likelihood that FYARRO will receive regulatory approval in the United States in other indications.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug designation or obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates and, even if we do, such exclusivity may not prevent the FDA, EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, from approving competing products.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product candidate as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. Our target indications may include diseases with large patient populations or may include orphan indications. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain orphan designations for our product candidates.\nIn the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity in the United States provides that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years,\nexcept in limited circumstances. The applicable exclusivity period is ten years in Europe. The European exclusivity period can be reduced to six years if a drug no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation or if the drug is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified.\nEven if orphan drug designation is granted for a product candidate, we may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for that product candidate. We may not be the first to obtain regulatory approval of any product candidate for which we have obtained orphan drug designation for the orphan-designated indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan-designated indication or may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if we are unable to ensure that we will be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Further, that the orphan drug exclusivity may not effectively protect an approved product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties may be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care or the manufacturer of the product with orphan exclusivity is unable to maintain sufficient product quantity. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the product candidate any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process or entitles the product candidate to priority review.\nWe received orphan drug designation from the FDA for FYARRO for the treatment of advanced malignant PEComa. We may be unable to obtain orphan drug designation for any other indication or regulatory approval for FYARRO for any other orphan population, or we may be unable to successfully commercialize FYARRO for such orphan population due to risks that include:\n\u2022\nthe orphan patient populations may change in size;\n\u2022\nthere may be changes in the treatment options for patients that may provide alternative treatments to FYARRO;\n\u2022\nthe development costs may be greater than projected revenue of drug sales for the orphan indications;\n\u2022\nthe regulatory agencies may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthere may be difficulties in enrolling patients for clinical trials;\n\u2022\nFYARRO may not prove to be efficacious in the respective orphan patient populations;\n\u2022\nclinical trial results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the regulatory agencies; and\n\u2022\nFYARRO may not have a favorable risk/benefit assessment in the respective orphan indication.\nIf we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for FYARRO in any other orphan population for which we obtain orphan drug designation or we are unable to successfully commercialize FYARRO for such orphan population, it could harm our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to obtain orphan drug exclusivity for FYARRO in additional indications or for one or more of our product candidates that we may develop in the future, and even if we do, that exclusivity may not prevent the FDA from approving other competing products.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product candidate as an orphan drug if it is a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition. A similar regulatory scheme governs approval of orphan product candidates by the EMA in the European Union. Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA or the EMA from approving another marketing application for another similar product candidate for the same orphan therapeutic indication for that time period. The applicable period is seven years in the United States and ten years in the European Union. The exclusivity period in the European Union can be reduced to six years if a product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, in particular if the product is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified.\nIn order for the FDA to grant orphan drug exclusivity to one of our product candidates, the agency must find that the product candidate is indicated for the treatment of a condition or disease that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or that affects 200,000 or more individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product candidate available for the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States. The FDA may conclude that the condition or disease for which we seek orphan drug exclusivity does not meet this standard. Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product candidate, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product candidate from competition because different product candidates can be approved for the same condition. In addition, even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same product candidate for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later product candidate is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care compared with the product that has orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity may also be lost if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of the patients with the rare disease or condition.\nWhere appropriate, we plan to secure approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities through the use of accelerated registration pathways. If we are unable to obtain such approval, we may be required to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials beyond those that we contemplate, which could increase the expense of obtaining, and delay the receipt of, necessary regulatory approvals. Even if we receive accelerated approval from the FDA, if our confirmatory trials do not verify clinical benefit, or if we do not comply with rigorous PMRs, the FDA may seek to withdraw accelerated approval.\nWhere possible, we plan to pursue accelerated development strategies in areas of high unmet need. We may seek an accelerated approval pathway for one or more of our product candidates. Under the accelerated approval provisions in the FDA, and the FDA\u2019s implementing regulations, the FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product candidate designed to treat a serious or life-threatening condition that generally provides a meaningful therapeutic benefit over available therapies upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint or intermediate clinical endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA considers a clinical benefit to be a positive therapeutic effect that is clinically meaningful in the context of a given disease, such as irreversible morbidity or mortality. For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. The accelerated approval pathway may be used in cases in which the advantage of a new drug over available therapy may not be a direct therapeutic advantage but is a clinically important improvement from a patient and public health perspective. If granted, accelerated approval is usually contingent on the sponsor\u2019s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug\u2019s clinical benefit. If such post-approval studies fail to confirm the drug\u2019s clinical benefit, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.\nPrior to seeking such accelerated approval, we will seek feedback from the FDA and will otherwise evaluate our ability to seek and receive such accelerated approval. There can be no assurance that after our evaluation of the feedback and other factors we will decide to pursue or submit an NDA for accelerated approval or any other form of expedited development, review or approval. Similarly, there can be no assurance that after subsequent FDA feedback we will continue to pursue or apply for accelerated approval or any other form of expedited development, review or approval, even if we initially decide to do so. Furthermore, if we decide to submit an application for accelerated approval or under another expedited regulatory designation (e.g., breakthrough therapy designation), there can be no assurance that such submission or application will be accepted or that any expedited development, review or approval will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. The FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities could also require us to conduct further studies prior to considering our application or granting approval of any type. A failure to obtain accelerated approval or any other form of expedited development, review or approval for our product candidate would result in a longer time period to commercialization of such product candidate, could increase the cost of development of such product candidate and could harm our competitive position in the marketplace.\nWe may face difficulties from changes to current regulations and future legislation.\nExisting regulatory policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any regulatory approval that we may have obtained, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nFor example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the \u201cACA\u201d), was passed, which substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the United States pharmaceutical industry. In December 2018, CMS published a final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of the federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. Since then, the ACA risk adjustment program payment parameters have been updated annually. Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the former Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. In June 2021, the Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to challenge the ACA, dismissing the case without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Accordingly, the ACA remains in effect in its current form. It is unclear how this decision and other healthcare reforms will impact our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In January 2013, former President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for FYARRO or any other product candidates that we may develop if the future, if approved, and accordingly, our financial operations.\nMoreover, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, at the federal level, in September 2018, CMS announced that it will allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2019. Additionally, CMS issued a final rule, effective on July 9, 2019, that requires direct-to-consumer television advertisements of prescription drugs and biological products, for which payment is available through or under Medicare or Medicaid, to include in the advertisement the Wholesale Acquisition Cost, or list price, of that drug or biological product if it is equal to or greater than $35 for a monthly supply or usual course of treatment. Prescription drugs and biological products that are in violation of these requirements will be included on a public list. In 2020, at the federal level, under the former Trump administration, HHS and CMS issued various rules that are expected to impact, among others, price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, importation of prescription drugs from Canada and other countries, manufacturer price reporting requirements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements. Multiple lawsuits have been brought against the HHS challenging various aspects of these new rules. As a result, the Biden administration and HHS have delayed the implementation or published rules rescinding some of these Trump-era policies.\nUnder the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs will be eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of\nproducts, which could have a material impact on our business. Further, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, \u201cPromoting Competition in the American Economy,\u201d with multiple provisions aimed at increasing competition for prescription drugs. In response to this executive order, the HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles. In addition, Congress is considering legislation that, if passed, could have significant impact on prices of prescription drugs covered by Medicare, including limitations on drug price increases. The impact of these legislative, executive, and administrative actions and any future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the Biden administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates if approved. Complying with any new legislation and regulatory changes could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.\nAt the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, a number of states are considering or have recently enacted state drug price transparency and reporting laws that could substantially increase our compliance burdens and expose us to greater liability under such state laws once we begin commercialization after obtaining regulatory approval for any of our products. Implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms that affect the pricing and/or availability of drug products may impact our ability to generate revenue, attain or maintain profitability, or commercialize products for which we may receive regulatory approval in the future.\nFurther, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 (Right to Try Act), was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new product candidates that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act.\nWe expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for biotechnology products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the regulatory approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent regulatory approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or in other jurisdictions. If we or our collaborators are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or our collaborators are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our product candidates may lose any marketing approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, the collection and use of health data in the European Union is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), which extends the geographical scope of European Union data protection law to non-European Union entities under certain conditions and imposes substantial obligations upon companies and new rights for individuals. Failure to comply with the GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the European Union Member States may result in fines up to \u20ac20.0 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties. The\nGDPR may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we may process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms in an effort to comply with the GDPR. This may be onerous and if our efforts to comply with GDPR or other applicable European Union laws and regulations are not successful, it could adversely affect our business in the European Union.\nFinally, state and foreign laws may apply generally to the privacy and security of information we maintain, and may differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which took effect on January 1, 2020, gives California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. In addition, the CCPA (a) allows enforcement by the California Attorney General, with fines set at $2,500 per violation (i.e., per person) or $7,500 per intentional violation and (b) authorizes private lawsuits to recover statutory damages for certain data breaches. While it exempts some data regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) and certain clinical trials data, the CCPA, to the extent applicable to our business and operations, may increase our compliance costs and potential liability with respect to other personal information we collect about California residents. Some observers note that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.\nInadequate funding for the FDA, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new product candidates to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, in recent years, including in 2018 and 2019, the United States government shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, had to furlough critical employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Separately, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the FDA announced its intention to postpone most inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities and products as well as routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities and provided guidance regarding the conduct of clinical trials. In April 2021, the FDA issued guidance for industry formally announcing plans to employ remote interactive evaluations, using risk management methods, to meet user fee commitments and goal dates and based on updated guidance issued in May 2021, FDA continues to conduct mission-critical inspections on a case-by-case basis, or, where possible to do so safely, has, since July 2020, resumed prioritized domestic inspections, which generally include pre-approval, pre-license, surveillance, and for-cause inspections. Should FDA determine that an inspection is necessary for approval and an inspection cannot be completed during the review cycle due to restrictions on travel, and the FDA does not determine a remote interactive evaluation to be adequate, the agency has stated that it generally intends to issue a complete response letter or defer action on the application until an inspection can be completed. In 2020 and 2021, a number of companies announced receipt of complete response letters due to the FDA\u2019s inability to complete required inspections for their applications. While the FDA indicated that it will consider alternative methods for inspections and exercise discretion on a case-by-case basis to approve products based on a desk review, if a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities on a timely basis, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and may experience delays in their regulatory activities. Further, in our operations as a public company, future government shutdowns could\nimpact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.\nIf we fail to comply with other United States healthcare laws and compliance requirements, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, our relationships with healthcare professionals, clinical investigators, CROs and third-party payors in connection with our current and future business activities may be subject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security laws, which could expose us to significant losses, including, among other things, criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, exclusion from governmental healthcare programs, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, clinical investigators, CROs, third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain regulatory approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations may include the following:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti- Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. Violations are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties for each violation, plus up to three times the remuneration involved, imprisonment, and exclusion from government healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties;\n\u2022\nthe federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalties laws, prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the federal False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to \u201ccause\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The federal False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the federal False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery;\n\u2022\nFederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making, or causing to be made, false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nthe federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, offering or transferring remuneration to a federal healthcare beneficiary that a person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s decision to order or receive items or services reimbursable by the government from a particular provider or supplier;\n\u2022\nthe FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and other local anti-corruption laws that apply to our international activities;\n\u2022\nthe federal HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit a person from knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare\nmatters; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d) and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates, independent contractors or agents of covered entities, that perform services for them that involve the creation, maintenance, receipt, use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, there may be additional federal, state and non-U.S. laws which govern the privacy and security of health and other personal information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance effort;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to CMS information regarding certain payments and other transfers of value made to covered recipients in the previously year, including physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, among others), and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; our failure to submit required information timely, accurately, and completely may result in significant civil monetary penalties and may increase our liability under other federal laws or regulations; and\n\u2022\nadditionally, we are subject to state and foreign equivalents of each of the healthcare laws and regulations described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payor. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, and may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental payors, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America\u2019s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state and require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. State and foreign laws, including for example the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective May 2018 also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement, we could be subject to penalties. Finally, there are state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance effort.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exceptions or safe harbors, it is possible that some of our activities, including those of our contractors or agents who conduct business for or on behalf of us, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Any action brought against us for violations of these laws or regulations, even successfully defended, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. We may be subject to private \u201cqui tam\u201d actions brought by individual whistleblowers on behalf of the federal or state governments.\nIf we were to grow our business and expand our sales organization or rely on distributors outside of the United States, we would be at increased risk of violating these laws or our internal policies and procedures. The risk of us being found in violation of these or other laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of\ninterpretations. Any action brought against us for violation of these or other laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nEfforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare and data privacy laws and regulations will involve on-going substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm our business and our financial results. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. Further, if any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nOur employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial collaborators, principal investigators, CROs, suppliers and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial collaborators, principal investigators, CROs, suppliers and vendors may engage in fraud, misconduct or other improper activities. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless, and negligent conduct that fails to: comply with the regulations of the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities; provide true, complete and accurate information to the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities; comply with manufacturing standards we have established; comply with federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar foreign fraudulent misconduct laws; accurately report financial information or data or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, research, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by these parties could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of conduct, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by these parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending our self or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant penalties, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nIf we or any contract manufacturers and suppliers we engage fails to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe and any contract manufacturers and suppliers we engage are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements, including those governing laboratory procedures, the generation, handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous and regulated materials and wastes, the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air, and water; and employee health and safety. The operations of our contractors may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and accordingly may produce hazardous waste products. Our contract manufacturers and suppliers generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials\nand wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, including any contamination at our current or past facilities and at third-party facilities, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or commercialization efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nOur business activities may be subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws of other countries in which we operate, as well as United States and certain foreign export controls, trade sanctions, and import laws and regulations. Compliance with these legal requirements could limit our ability to compete in foreign markets and subject us to liability if we violate them.\nOur business activities may be subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the UK Bribery Act. The FCPA generally prohibits companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from offering, promising, giving or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, hospitals are owned and operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are employed by the government and would be considered foreign officials under the FCPA, and often the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these doctors, hospital employees and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. Recently, the SEC and DOJ have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. There is no certainty that all of our employees, agents, collaborators, or contractors, or those of our affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, particularly given the high level of complexity of these laws. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, disgorgement, and other sanctions and remedial measures, the closing down of our facilities, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international activities, our ability to attract and retain employees and our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, our products may be subject to U.S. and foreign export controls, trade sanctions and import laws and regulations. Governmental regulation of the import or export of our products, or our failure to obtain any required import or export authorization for our products, when applicable, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenue. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the export of our products may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets or, in some cases, prevent the export of our products to some countries altogether. Furthermore, United States export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments, and persons targeted by United States sanctions. For example, the U.S. government and other governments in jurisdictions in which we may operate in the future have imposed severe sanctions and export controls against Russia and Russian interests and threatened additional sanctions and controls in connection with the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The impact of these measures, as well as potential responses to them by Russia, is currently unknown and they could adversely affect our business, supply chain, business partners or customers.\nIf we fail to comply with export and import regulations, and such economic sanctions, penalties could be imposed, including fines and/or denial of certain export privileges. Moreover, any new export or import restrictions, new legislation or shifting approaches in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or in the countries, persons, or products targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business.\nFurther, with rising international trade tensions or sanctions, our business may be adversely affected following new or increased tariffs that result in increased global clinical trial costs as a result of international transportation of clinical drug supplies, as well as the costs of materials and products imported into the U.S. Tariffs, trade restrictions or sanctions imposed by the U.S. or other countries, including as a result geopolitical tension, such as a deterioration in the relationship between the United States and China or escalation in conflict between Russia and Ukraine, including any additional sanctions, export controls or other restrictive actions that may be imposed by the United States and/or other countries against governmental or other entities in Russia, could increase the prices of our and our collaboration partners\u2019 drug products, affect our and our collaboration partners\u2019 ability to commercialize such drug products, or create adverse tax consequences in the U.S. or other countries. As a result, changes in international trade policy, changes in trade agreements and the imposition of tariffs or sanctions by the U.S. or other countries could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters, Managing Our Growth and Other Risks Related to our Business\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled executive officers, key scientific personnel and employees.\nTo succeed, we must recruit, retain, manage and motivate qualified clinical, scientific, technical and management personnel, and we face significant competition for experienced personnel. We are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific and medical staff. If we do not succeed in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly at the management level, it could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results. In particular, the loss of one or more of our executive officers or key scientific personnel could be detrimental to us if we cannot recruit suitable replacements in a timely manner. We will need to hire additional personnel as we expand our clinical development and commercial activities. We could in the future have difficulty attracting and retaining experienced personnel and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment and retention efforts.\nMany of the other biotechnology companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than us. They also may provide higher compensation, more diverse opportunities and better prospects for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high-quality candidates than what we have to offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can discover, develop and commercialize our product candidates will be limited and the potential for successfully growing our business will be harmed.\nAdditionally, we rely on our scientific and clinical advisors and consultants to assist us in formulating our research, development and clinical strategies. These advisors and consultants are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us. In addition, these advisors and consultants typically will not enter into non-compete agreements with us. If a conflict of interest arises between their work for us and their work for another entity, we may lose their services. Furthermore, our advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing products or technologies that may compete with ours. In particular, if we are unable to maintain consulting relationships with these advisors or they provide services to our competitors, our development and commercialization efforts will be impaired and our business will be significantly harmed.\nIf we are unable to establish sales or marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell or market our product candidates, we may not be able to successfully sell or market our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval.\nIn order to commercialize FYARRO or any other product candidate that we may develop in the future, if approved, we must build marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make\narrangements with third parties to perform these services for each of the territories in which we may have approval to sell or market our product candidates. There are risks involved with both establishing our own commercial capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services and we may not be successful in accomplishing these required tasks, which may negatively impact the successful commercialization of FYARRO for advanced malignant PEComa.\nEstablishing an internal sales or marketing team with technical expertise and supporting distribution capabilities to commercialize our product candidates will be expensive and time-consuming and will require significant attention of our executive officers to manage. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities could adversely impact the commercialization of any of our product candidates that we obtain approval to market, if we do not have arrangements in place with third parties to provide such services on our behalf. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales team and establish marketing and other commercialization capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our commercialization personnel. Alternatively, if we choose to collaborate, either globally or on a territory-by-territory basis, with third parties that have direct sales forces and established distribution systems, either to augment our own sales force and distribution systems or in lieu of our own sales force and distribution systems, we will be required to negotiate and enter into arrangements with such third parties relating to the proposed collaboration and such arrangements may prove to be less profitable than commercializing the product on its own. If we are unable to enter into such arrangements when needed, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval, or any such commercialization may experience delays or limitations. We may have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively. If we are unable to successfully commercialize our approved product candidates, either on our own or through collaborations with one or more third parties, our future product revenue will suffer, and we may incur significant additional losses.\nIn order to successfully implement our plans and strategies, we will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of March 1, 2022, we had 51 full-time employees, including 32 employees engaged in research and development. In order to successfully implement our development and commercialization plans and strategies, and as we continue operating as a public company, we expect to need additional managerial, operational, development, sales, marketing, financial and other personnel. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u2022\nidentifying, recruiting, integrating, maintaining and motivating additional employees;\n\u2022\nmanaging our internal development efforts effectively, including the clinical, FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory agencies\u2019 review process for FYARRO and any other product candidates, while complying with any contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties we may have; and\n\u2022\nimproving our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nOur future financial performance and our ability to successfully develop and commercialize FYARRO and any other product candidates we may develop in the future, if approved, will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth, and our management may also have to divert a disproportionate amount of our attention away from day-to-day activities in order to devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities.\nWe currently rely, and for the foreseeable future will continue to rely, in substantial part on certain independent organizations, advisors and consultants to provide certain services, including key aspects of clinical development and manufacturing. We cannot assure you that the services of independent organizations, advisors and consultants will continue to be available to us on a timely basis when needed, or that we can find qualified replacements. In addition, if we are unable to effectively manage our outsourced activities or if the quality or accuracy of the services provided by third-party service providers is compromised for any reason, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of FYARRO and any other product candidates or otherwise advance our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to manage our existing third-party service providers or find other competent outside contractors and consultants on economically reasonable terms, or at all.\nIf we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring new employees and/or engaging additional third-party service providers, we may not be able to successfully implement the tasks necessary to further develop and commercialize FYARRO and other product candidates and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development and commercialization goals.\nOur internal computer systems, or those of any of our CROs, manufacturers, other contractors or consultants or potential future collaborators, may fail or suffer security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or personal data, which could result in additional costs, loss of revenue, significant liabilities, harm to our brand and material disruption of our operations.\nDespite the implementation of security measures in an effort to protect systems that store our information, given their size and complexity and the increasing amounts of information maintained on our internal information technology systems, and those of our third-party CROs, other contractors (including sites performing our clinical trials) and consultants, these systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other damage or interruption from service interruptions, system malfunction, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, as well as security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, contractors, consultants, business partners, and/or other third parties, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties (including the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information), which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to the loss, destruction, alteration or dissemination of, or damage to, our data. As the cyber-threat landscape evolves, these attacks are growing in frequency, sophistication and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss, destruction, unavailability, alteration or dissemination of, or damage to, our data or applications, or for it to be believed or reported that any of these occurred, we could incur liability and reputational damage and the development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed. We cannot assure you that our data protection efforts and our investment in information technology, or the efforts or investments of CROs, consultants or other third parties, will prevent significant breakdowns or breaches in systems or other cyber incidents that cause loss, destruction, unavailability, alteration or dissemination of, or damage to, our data that could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation, business, operations or financial condition. For example, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our programs and the development of our product candidates could be delayed. In addition, the loss of clinical trial data for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. Furthermore, significant disruptions of our internal information technology systems or security breaches could result in the loss, misappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, data (including trade secrets or other confidential information, intellectual property, proprietary business information, and personal information or individually identifiable health information), which could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us. For example, any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our clinical trial subjects or employees, could harm our reputation directly, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure and reputational damages that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.\nSome of the federal, state and foreign government requirements include obligations of companies to notify individuals of security breaches involving particular personally identifiable information, which could result from breaches experienced by us or by our vendors, contractors or organizations with which it has formed strategic relationships. Notifications and follow-up actions related to a security incident could impact our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, including legal expenses and remediation costs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the lost data. We expect to incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent security incidents, and we may face increased costs and requirements to expend substantial resources in the event of an actual or perceived security breach. We also rely on third parties to manufacture our product candidates, and similar events relating to their computer systems could also have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent that any disruption or security incident were to result in a loss, destruction or alteration of, or damage to, our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary\ninformation, we could be exposed to litigation and governmental investigations, the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed, and we could be subject to significant fines or penalties for any noncompliance with certain state, federal and/ or international privacy and security laws.\nOur insurance policies may not be adequate to compensate us for the potential losses arising from any\nsuch disruption, failure or security breach of our systems or third-party systems where information important to our business operations or commercial development is stored. In addition, such insurance may not be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims made against us and could have high deductibles in any event, and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management attention.\nWe, or the third parties upon whom we depend, may be adversely affected by earthquakes, wildfires and other natural disasters, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nAny unplanned event, such as flood, fire, explosion, earthquake, extreme weather condition, medical epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, power shortage, telecommunication failure or other natural or manmade accidents or incidents that result in us being unable to fully utilize our facilities, or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party CMOs, may have a material and adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, particularly on a daily basis, and have significant negative consequences on our financial and operating conditions. Loss of access to these facilities may result in increased costs, delays in the development of our product candidate or interruption of our business operations. Earthquakes, wildfires or other natural disasters could further disrupt our operations, including at our California headquarters, and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our research facilities or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party CMOs, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, could have a material adverse effect on our business. As part of our risk management policy, we maintain insurance coverage at levels that we believe are appropriate for our business. However, in the event of an accident or incident at these facilities, we cannot assure you that the amounts of insurance will be sufficient to satisfy any damages and losses. If our facilities, or the manufacturing facilities of our third-party CMOs, are unable to operate because of an accident or incident or for any other reason, even for a short period of time, any or all of our research and development programs may be harmed. Any business interruption may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be limited.\nOur NOL carryforwards may be unavailable to offset future taxable income because of restrictions under United States tax law. Our NOLs generated in tax years beginning before January 1, 2018 are only permitted to be carried forward for 20 taxable years under applicable United States federal tax law, and therefore could expire unused. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), as modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d), our federal NOLs generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of federal NOLs in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020 is limited to 80% of our current year taxable income. NOLs generated in tax years beginning before January 1, 2018 will not be subject to the taxable income limitation and will continue to have a two-year carryback and twenty-year carryforward period. California recently enacted legislation limiting our ability to use our state NOLs for taxable years 2020, 2021, and 2022. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act. As of December 31, 2021, after consideration of the NOLs that have been estimated to expire unused under Section 382, we had federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $150.9 million, $44.3 million of which will begin to expire in 2030, the remaining $106.6 million of federal NOL carryforwards do not expire. We also have available California NOL carryforwards of approximately $44.4 million as of December 31, 2021, which begin to expire in 2037.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a cumulative change in the corporation\u2019s ownership by \u201c5-\npercent stockholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and certain other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change taxable income may be limited. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We have experienced such ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of the Merger or subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which are outside our control. As of December 31, 2021, we have completed an IRC Section 382 analysis through the date of the Merger. Ownership changes were identified that will result in annual limitations on future utilization of NOL and research and development credit carryforwards. To the extent such limitations will cause NOL and research and development credit carryforwards to expire unused, these tax attributes have been removed from our deferred tax asset. Our ability to utilize our NOLs and certain other tax attributes could be limited by an \u201cownership change\u201d as described above and consequently, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs and certain other tax attributes, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.\nUnited States federal income tax reform could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nLegislation or other changes in United States and international tax laws could increase our tax liability and adversely affect after-tax profitability. For example, the Biden administration has proposed to increase the United States corporate income tax rate, increase the United States taxation of international business operations and impose a global minimum tax on corporate income. Such proposed changes, as well as regulations and legal decisions interpreting and applying these changes, may have significant impacts on our effective tax rate, cash tax expenses and net deferred tax assets in future periods.\nA variety of risks associated with marketing our products or any product candidates that we may develop in the future, if approved, internationally could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe may seek regulatory approval of our product candidates outside of the United States and, accordingly, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including:\n\u2022\ndiffering regulatory requirements and reimbursement regimes in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u2022\ndifficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\npotential liability under the FCPA or comparable foreign regulations;\n\u2022\nchallenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection in the United States and other countries for our product and product candidates, proprietary technologies and their uses, and know-how related to our business, as well as our ability to operate without infringing upon the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of others. We generally seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our product and product candidates, proprietary technologies and their uses that are important to our business. We also seek to protect our proprietary position by acquiring or in-licensing relevant issued patents or pending applications from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.\nPending patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless, and until, patents issue from such applications, and then only to the extent the issued claims cover the technology. There can be no assurance that our patent applications or the patent applications of our licensors will result in additional patents being issued in any particular jurisdiction or that issued patents will afford sufficient protection against competitors with similar technology, nor can there be any assurance that the patents issued will not be infringed, designed around or invalidated by third parties.\nEven issued patents may later be found invalid or unenforceable or may be modified or revoked in proceedings instituted by third parties before various patent offices or in courts. The degree of future protection for us and our licensors\u2019 proprietary rights is uncertain. Only limited protection may be available and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. These uncertainties and/or limitations in our ability to properly protect the intellectual property rights relating to our product or product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we own or license ten (10) issued patents in the United States, four (4) of which have composition of matter and method of use claims covering FYARRO, we cannot be certain that the claims in our other United States pending patent applications, corresponding international patent applications and patent applications in certain foreign territories, or those of our licensors, will be considered patentable by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the \u201cUSPTO\u201d), courts in the United States or by the patent offices and courts in foreign countries, nor can we be certain that the claims in our issued patent will not be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged.\nThe patent application process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that we or any of our current or potential future collaborators will be successful in protecting our product or product candidates by obtaining and defending patents. These risks and uncertainties include the following:\n\u2022\nthe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process, the noncompliance with which can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, and partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction;\n\u2022\npatent applications may not result in any patents being issued;\n\u2022\nif clinical trials encounter delays, the period of time during which we could market our current or future product candidates under patent protection would be reduced;\n\u2022\npatents may be challenged, invalidated, modified, narrowed, revoked, circumvented, found to be unenforceable, found to be not infringed or otherwise may not provide any competitive advantage;\n\u2022\nOur competitors, many of whom have substantially greater resources than we do and many of whom have made significant investments in competing technologies, may seek or may have already obtained patents that could limit, interfere with or eliminate our ability to make, use and sell our product or potential product candidates or design around any of our owned, co-owned, or licensed patents;\n\u2022\nsince patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to either (i) file any patent application related to our product; or (ii) invent any of the inventions claimed in our patents or patent applications;\n\u2022\neven when laws provide protection, costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and the outcome of such litigation would be uncertain. Moreover, any actions we may bring to enforce our intellectual property against our competitors could provoke them to bring counterclaims against us;\n\u2022\nthere may be significant pressure on the United States government and international governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection both inside and outside the United States for disease treatments that prove successful, as a matter of public policy regarding worldwide health concerns; and\n\u2022\ncountries other than the United States may have patent laws less favorable to patentees than those upheld by United States courts, allowing foreign competitors a better opportunity to create, develop and market competing products or product candidates.\nThe patent prosecution process is also expensive, complex, and time-consuming, and we and our licensors may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner or in all jurisdictions where protection may be commercially advantageous. It is also possible that we and our licensors will fail to identify patentable aspects of our (or such licensor\u2019s) research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. If we are unable to obtain or maintain patent protection with respect to any of our proprietary products and technology we develop, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially harmed.\nIn addition, although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, outside scientific collaborators, CROs, third-party manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach such agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection.\nGiven the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our intellectual property may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to our products.\nIf the scope of any patent protection we obtain is not sufficiently broad, or if we lose any of our patent protection, our ability to prevent our competitors from commercializing similar or identical products or product candidates would be adversely affected.\nThe patent position of biopharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and has been the subject of much litigation in recent years. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the United States or in many foreign jurisdictions. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries. Our pending and future patent applications and those of our licensors may not result in patents being issued that protect our product or product candidates or effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive products or product candidates.\nMoreover, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and our scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Even if patent applications we own or in-licenses currently or in the future issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors or other third parties from competing with us, or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Any patents that we own or in-licenses may be challenged or circumvented by third parties or may be narrowed or invalidated as a result of challenges by third parties. Consequently, we do not know whether our product or product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by valid and enforceable patents.\nOur competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent our patents or the patents of our licensors by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our patents or the patents of our licensors may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. We may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, revocation, reexamination, post-grant review (\u201cPGR\u201d) and inter partes review (\u201cIPR\u201d), or other similar proceedings challenging our owned patent rights. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate or render unenforceable, our patent rights or put its patent applications at risk of not issuing, allow third parties to commercialize our product or product candidates and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. Moreover, our patents or the patents of our licensors may become subject to post-grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions in a foreign patent office, which challenge our priority of invention or other features of patentability with respect to our patents and patent applications and those of our licensors. Such challenges may result in loss of patent rights, loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our product or product candidates. Such proceedings also may result in substantial cost and require significant time from our scientists and management, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications or the patents and patent applications of our licensors is threatened, regardless of the outcome, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future products or product candidates. If any of our patents, if and when issued, covering our product candidates are invalidated or found unenforceable, our financial position and results of operations would be materially and adversely impacted. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we or any third-party initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded if we were to prevail may not be commercially meaningful.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022\nothers may be able to develop products that are similar to FYARRO or our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or license;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or patent application that we own or license;\n\u2022\nWe or our licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nit is possible that the pending patent applications we own or license will not lead to issued patents;\n\u2022\nissued patents that we own or license may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u2022\nOur competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022\nWe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u2022\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business; and\n\u2022\nWe may choose not to file a patent in order to maintain certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third party may subsequently file a patent covering such intellectual property.\nShould any of these events occur, it could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. Claims by third parties that we infringe their proprietary rights may result in liability for damages or prevent or delay our developmental and commercialization efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on avoiding infringement or misappropriation of the patents, intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. However, our research, development and commercialization activities may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate patents or other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by third parties. Other entities may have or obtain patents or proprietary rights that could limit our ability to make, use, sell, offer for sale or import our products or products that may be approved in the future, or impair our competitive position. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biopharmaceutical industry, including patent infringement lawsuits, oppositions, reexaminations, IPR proceedings and PGR proceedings before the USPTO and/or corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous third-party United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications exist in the fields in which we are developing products or product candidates. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product or product candidates.\nAs the biopharmaceutical industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product or product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties. Because patent applications are maintained as confidential for a certain period of time, until the relevant application is published, we may be unaware of third-party patents that may be infringed by commercialization of our product or any of our product candidates, and we cannot be certain that we were the first to file a patent application related to a product or technology. Moreover, because patent applications can take many years to issue, and because patent claims can be revised before issuance, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our product or product candidates may infringe or which such third parties claim are infringed by our technologies. In addition, identification of third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our technology is difficult because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. There is also no assurance that there is not prior art of which we are aware, but which we do not believe is relevant to our business, which may, nonetheless, ultimately be found to limit our ability to make, use, sell, offer for sale or import our products that may be approved in the future, or impair our competitive position. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If a patent holder believes one or more of our products or product candidates infringes such holder\u2019s patent rights, the patent holder may sue us even if we have received patent protection. Moreover, we may face patent infringement claims from non-practicing entities that have no relevant drug revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may thus have no deterrent effect. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would be time consuming and could:\n\u2022\nresult in costly litigation that may cause negative publicity;\n\u2022\ndivert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management;\n\u2022\ncause development delays;\n\u2022\nprevent us from commercializing any of our product candidates until the asserted patent expires or is held finally invalid or not infringed in a court of law;\n\u2022\nrequire us to develop non-infringing technology, which may not be possible on a cost-effective basis;\n\u2022\nsubject us to significant liability to third parties; or\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or which might be non-exclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same technology.\nAlthough no third party has asserted a claim of patent infringement against us as of the date of this Annual Report, others may hold proprietary rights that could prevent FYARRO or our product candidates from being marketed. For example, various patent offices periodically grant mode of action patents and a third party may have or obtain a patent with claims covering modes of action relevant to our product or product candidates. While these mode of action patents may be difficult to enforce, the third party may assert a claim of patent infringement directed at one of our products or product candidates. Any patent-related legal action or any claim relating to intellectual property\ninfringement that is successfully asserted against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to our products or processes could subject us to significant liability for damages, including treble damages and attorney\u2019s fees if it was determined that we willfully infringed, and require us to obtain a license to manufacture or market our product or product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. We cannot predict whether we would prevail in any such actions or that any license required under any of these patents would be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. Moreover, even if we or our current or future strategic partners were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. In addition, we cannot be certain that we could redesign our product or product candidates or processes to avoid infringement, if necessary. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or the failure to obtain necessary licenses, could prevent or delay us from developing and commercializing our product or product candidates, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, intellectual property litigation, regardless of our outcome, may cause negative publicity and could prohibit us from marketing or otherwise commercializing our product or product candidates and technology.\nIn addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur rights to develop and commercialize our technology, product and product candidates may be subject, in part, to the terms and conditions of licenses granted to us by others.\nWe have entered into license agreements with third parties and we may enter into additional license agreements in the future with others to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product or product candidates. These and other licenses may not provide exclusive rights to use such intellectual property and technology in all relevant fields of use and in all territories in which we may wish to develop or commercialize our technology and products in the future.\nIn addition, subject to the terms of any such license agreements, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, enforcement, and defense of patents and patent applications covering the technology that we license from third parties. In such an event, we cannot be certain that these patents and patent applications will be prepared, filed, prosecuted, maintained, enforced, and defended in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If our licensors fail to prosecute, maintain, enforce, and defend such patents, or lose rights to those patents or patent applications, the rights we had licensed may be reduced or eliminated, and our rights to develop and commercialize any of our products that are subject of such licensed rights could be adversely affected.\nOur licensors may have relied on third-party consultants or collaborators or on funds from third parties such that our licensors are not the sole and exclusive owners of the patents we in-licensed. If other third parties have ownership rights to our in-licensed patents, they may be able to license such patents to our competitors, and our competitors could market competing products and technology. This could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nIt is possible that we may be unable to obtain additional licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to redesign our technology, product, product candidates, or the methods for manufacturing them or to develop or license replacement technology, all of which may not be feasible on a technical or commercial basis. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected product or product candidates, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects significantly. We cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist which might be enforced against our current technology, manufacturing methods, product, product candidates, or future methods or products resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our manufacture, sales or future sales, or, with respect to our future sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties, which could be significant.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties or otherwise experiences disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nDisputes may arise between us and our licensors regarding intellectual property subject to a license agreement, including:\n\u2022\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022\nwhether and the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u2022\nour right to sublicense patents and other rights to third parties;\n\u2022\nour diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u2022\nour right to transfer or assign the license;\n\u2022\nthe inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our licensors and partners; and\n\u2022\nthe priority of invention of patented technology.\nIn addition, the agreements under which we license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product or product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nIn spite of our best efforts, our licensors might conclude that we have materially breached our license agreements and might therefore terminate the license agreements, thereby removing our ability to develop and commercialize products and technology covered by these license agreements. If these in-licenses are terminated, or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended exclusivity, competitors would have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products identical to ours. This could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe patent protection and patent prosecution for our product and for some of our product candidates may be dependent on third parties.\nWhile we normally seek to obtain the right to control prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of the patents relating to our product or product candidates, there may be times when the filing and prosecution activities for patents relating to our product or product candidates are controlled by our licensors or collaboration partners, including those licensed to us under our license agreements. If any of our licensors or collaboration partners fail to prosecute, maintain and enforce such patents and patent applications in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business, including by payment of all applicable fees for patents covering our product or product candidates, we could lose our rights to the intellectual property or our exclusivity with respect to those rights, our ability to develop and commercialize our product or those product candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products. We collaborate with other companies and institutions with respect to research and development matters. Also, we rely on numerous third parties to provide us with materials that we use to develop our technology. If we cannot successfully negotiate sufficient ownership, licensing, and/or commercial rights to any invention that result from our use of any third-party collaborator\u2019s materials, or if disputes arise with respect to the intellectual property developed with the use of a collaborator\u2019s materials, or data developed in a collaborator\u2019s study, our ability to capitalize on the market potential of these inventions or developments may be limited or precluded altogether. In addition, even where we have the right to control patent prosecution of patents and patent applications we have licensed to and from third parties, we may still be adversely affected or prejudiced by actions or inactions of our licensees, our licensors and their counsel that took place prior to the date upon which we assumed control over patent prosecution.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to our product or product candidates through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nBecause our development programs may in the future require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of our business may depend in part on our ability to acquire, in-license, or use these third-party proprietary rights. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary for our product or product candidates. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. Moreover, collaboration arrangements are complex and time-consuming to negotiate, document, implement and maintain. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish and implement collaborations or other alternative arrangements should we choose to enter into such arrangements. We may also be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would be favorable to us or allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license to intellectual property of interest, we may not be able to secure exclusive rights, in which case others could use the same rights and compete with us. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third- party intellectual property rights or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of the relevant program or product candidate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits or other proceedings to protect or enforce our patents or intellectual property or our licensors\u2019 patents or intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful. Further, our issued patents or our licensors\u2019 patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court.\nCompetitors and other third parties may infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate our patents and other intellectual property rights. To prevent infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent we own or in-license is not valid, is unenforceable and/or is not infringed. If we or any of our potential future collaborators were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent directed at one of our products or product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent or the patent of our licensors is invalid and/or unenforceable in whole or in part. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge include an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, written description, non-enablement, or obviousness-type double patenting. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could include an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution of the patent application.\nThird parties may also raise similar invalidity claims before the USPTO or patent offices abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, PGR, IPR, derivation proceedings, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in the revocation of, cancellation of or amendment to our patents or our licensors\u2019 patents in such a way that such patents no longer cover our technology or platform, product or any product candidates that we may develop. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a third party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our technology or platform, product or any product candidates that we may develop. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and/or unenforceability is unpredictable, and prior art could render our patents or our licensors\u2019 patents invalid. There is no assurance that all potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications, or the patents and patent applications of our licensors has been found. There is also no assurance that there is not prior art of which we are aware, but which we do not believe affects the validity or enforceability of a claim in our patents and patent applications or the patents and patent applications of our licensors, which may, nonetheless, ultimately be found to affect the validity or enforceability of a claim.\nIf a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we may lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on such product or product candidate. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications or the patents and patent applications of our licensors is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future products or product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to our intellectual property rights may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or other legal proceedings relating to our intellectual property rights, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation or other proceedings.\nIn addition, the issuance of a patent does not give us the right to practice the patented invention. Third parties may have blocking patents that could prevent us from marketing our own patented product and practicing our own patented technology.\nIntellectual property litigation may lead to unfavorable publicity that harms our reputation and causes the market price of our common shares to decline.\nDuring the course of any intellectual property litigation, there could be public announcements of the initiation of the litigation as well as results of hearings, rulings on motions, and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the perceived value of our product or product candidates, programs or intellectual property could be diminished. Accordingly, the market price of shares of our common stock may decline. Such announcements could also harm our reputation or the market for our future products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDerivation proceedings may be necessary to determine priority of inventions, and an unfavorable outcome may require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights from the prevailing party.\nDerivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to us from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of derivation proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. In addition, the uncertainties associated with such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties or enter into development or manufacturing partnerships that would help us bring our product or product candidates to market.\nPatent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications or those of our licensors and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents or those of our licensors.\nOn September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \u201cLeahy-Smith Act\u201d), was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to United States patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. In particular, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned in March 2013 to a \u201cfirst inventor to file\u201d system in which,\nassuming that other requirements of patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent regardless of whether a third party was first to invent the claimed invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after March 2013 but before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by such third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Furthermore, our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends on whether the differences between our technology and the prior art allow our technology to be patentable over the prior art. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing or until issuance, we may not be certain that we or our licensors are the first to either (1) file any patent application related to our product or product candidates or (2) invent any of the inventions claimed in the patents or patent applications.\nThe Leahy-Smith Act also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and also may affect patent litigation. These include allowing third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by USPTO administered post-grant proceedings, including PGR, IPR, and derivation proceedings. An adverse determination in any such submission or proceeding could reduce the scope or enforceability of, or invalidate, our patent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nBecause of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. Thus, the Leahy- Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications or those of our licensors and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents or those of our licensors, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nChanges in United States patent law, or laws in other countries, could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product or product candidates.\nAs is the case with other pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the pharmaceutical industry involve a high degree of technological and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing pharmaceutical patents is costly, time consuming and inherently uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in the interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property and may increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. We cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. In addition, Congress or other foreign legislative bodies may pass patent reform legislation that is unfavorable to us.\nFor example, the United States Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the United States Congress, the United States federal courts, the USPTO, or similar authorities in foreign jurisdictions, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and the patents we might obtain or license in the future.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe may also be subject to claims that our former employees or our licensors or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. Confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. The assignment of intellectual property rights under these agreements may not be automatic upon the creation of the intellectual property or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third\nparties, or defend claims that they may bring against it, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and distraction to management and other employees.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product or product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest United States non-provisional effective filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product or product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to us.\nIf we do not obtain patent term extension for our product or product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nIn January 2022, we filed an application for patent term extension based on the approval of FYARRO. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA regulatory approval of our product candidates, one or more of our United States patents or those of our licensors may also be eligible for limited patent term restoration under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. A maximum of one patent may be extended per FDA approved product as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only those claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Patent term extension may also be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval of our product candidates. However, we may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request or require. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration or the term of any such extension is less than we request or require, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially. Further, if this occurs, our competitors may take advantage of our investment in development and trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nAlthough we own, co-own, or have licensed issued patents in the United States and pending patent applications in the United States and other countries, filing, prosecuting and defending patents on our product or product candidates in all countries and jurisdictions throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States could be less extensive than those in the United States, assuming that rights are obtained in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. In addition, the statutory deadlines for pursuing patent protection in individual foreign jurisdictions are based on the priority date of each of our patent applications and we may not timely file foreign patent applications.\nCompetitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we do not pursue or have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product or product candidates, and our patents, the patents of our licensors, or other intellectual\nproperty rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. Even if we pursue and obtain issued patents in particular jurisdictions, our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent third parties from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of many foreign countries do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or our licensors\u2019 patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents or the patents of our licensors at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications or the patent applications of our licensors at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nMany countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and other requirements imposed by regulations and governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on our owned and in-licensed patents and/or applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various foreign patent offices at various points over the lifetime of our patents and/or applications and those of our licensors and any patent rights we may own or license in the future. We have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees, and, in certain instances, we rely on our licensor partners to pay these fees when due. Additionally, the USPTO and various foreign patent offices require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process and over the lifetime of our owned patents and applications. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with rules applicable to the particular jurisdiction. However, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If such an event were to occur, competitors or other third parties might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case and it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe intend to use registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names to brand and market ourselves and our products. Our trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition among potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively, and our business may be adversely affected. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nWe may also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. In addition, we rely on the protection of our trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information to maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. For example, we may be required to share our trade secrets with third-party licensees, collaborators, consultants, contractors, or other advisors and we have limited control over the protection of trade secrets used by such third parties. Although we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, including by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties and confidential information and inventions agreements with employees, consultants and advisors, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or that they have been obtained in all circumstances, and it is possible that any of these parties may breach the agreements and may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. In addition, these agreements typically restrict the ability of our collaborators, advisors, employees and consultants to publish data potentially relating to our trade secrets. Our academic collaborators typically have rights to publish data, provided that we are notified in advance and may delay publication for a specified time in order to secure our intellectual property rights arising from the collaboration. In other cases, publication rights are controlled exclusively by us, although in some cases we may share these rights with other parties. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained, disclosed, used or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets.\nMoreover, third parties may still obtain this information or may come upon this or similar information independently, and we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or other proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation or proceedings. If any of these events occurs or if we otherwise lose protection for our trade secrets or confidential or proprietary information, the value of this information may be greatly reduced, and our competitive position in the marketplace, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially adversely affected. If we do not apply for patent protection prior to such publication or if we cannot otherwise maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary technology and other confidential information, then our ability to obtain patent protection or to protect our trade secret information may be jeopardized.\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential information or trade secrets.\nWe have entered into and may enter in the future into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect the proprietary positions of third parties, such as outside scientific collaborators, CROs, third-party manufacturers, consultants, advisors, potential partners, and other third parties. We may become subject to litigation where a third party asserts that we or our employees, consultants or advisors inadvertently or otherwise breached the agreements and used or disclosed trade secrets or other information proprietary to the third parties. Defense of such matters, regardless of their merit, could involve substantial litigation expense and be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. We cannot predict whether we would prevail in any such actions. Moreover, intellectual property litigation, regardless of its outcome, may cause negative publicity and could prohibit us from marketing or otherwise commercializing our product or product candidates and technology. Failure to defend against any such claim could subject us to significant liability for monetary damages or prevent or delay our developmental and commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that we have wrongfully hired an employee from a competitor or that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential information or trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the pharmaceutical industry, in addition to our employees, we engage the services of consultants to assist us in the development of our product or product candidates. Many of these consultants, and many of our employees, were previously employed at, or may have previously provided or may be currently providing consulting services to, other pharmaceutical companies including competitors or our potential competitors. We may become subject to claims that we, our employees or a consultant inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade\nsecrets or other information proprietary to their former employers or their former or current clients. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could adversely affect our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management team and other employees.\nIntellectual property discovered through government funded programs may be subject to federal regulations such as \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights, certain reporting requirements and a preference for United States-based companies. Compliance with such regulations may limit our exclusive rights and limit our ability to contract with non-United States manufacturers.\nOur licensed patent applications may have been or may be in the future supported through the use of United States government funding awarded by the National Institute of Health or the FDA Office of Orphan Products Development and the Army Medical Research and Development Command. Although we do not currently own issued patents or pending patent applications that have been generated through the use of United States government funding, we have licensed, or may acquire or license in the future, intellectual property rights that have been generated through the use of United States government funding or grant. Pursuant to the Bayh- Dole Act of 1980, the United States government has certain rights in inventions developed with government funding. These United States government rights include a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the United States government has the right, under certain limited circumstances, to require us to grant exclusive, partially exclusive, or non-exclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if it determines that: (1) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention; (2) government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (3) government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations (\u201cmarch-in rights\u201d). The United States government also has the right to take title to these inventions if the grant recipient fails to disclose the invention to the government or fails to file an application to register the intellectual property within specified time limits. Intellectual property generated under a government funded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements, compliance with which may require us to expend substantial resources. In addition, the United States government requires that any products embodying any of these inventions or produced through the use of any of these inventions be manufactured substantially in the United States. This preference for United States industry may be waived by the federal agency that provided the funding if the owner or assignee of the intellectual property can show that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible. This preference for United States industry may limit our ability to contract with non-United States product manufacturers for products covered by such intellectual property.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe contract with qualified third parties for the production of FYARRO for commercialization and expect to continue to do so for additional clinical trials. This reliance on third parties, some of which are sole source suppliers, increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quality and quantities of FYARRO to meet demand or otherwise or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the infrastructure or internal capability to manufacture supplies of our product candidates for use in development and commercialization. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party manufacturers for the production of our products and product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical trials under the guidance of members of our organization. In the case of FYARRO, we rely on a single third-party manufacturer, Fresenius-Kabi, LLC (\u201cFresenius-Kabi\u201d), and currently have no alternative manufacturer in place. On January 13, 2022, we entered into a Negotiated Purchase Order Terms and Conditions for Clinical and Commercial Product (the \u201cFresenius Agreement\u201d) with Fresenius-Kabi pursuant to which Fresenius-Kabi will manufacture FYARRO for intravenous use for us, and we will purchase FYARRO as a finished drug product from Fresenius-Kabi, on a purchase-order basis. The Fresenius Agreement shall be effective through December 22, 2022 (or such later date as may be agreed between the parties in writing), and we may purchase FYARRO for either clinical or commercial purposes for use in the United States and Canada. The price of FYARRO will be fixed, subject to the ability of Fresenius-Kabi to increase pricing under specified circumstances. We also have an obligation to purchase certain minimum\nquantities of FYARRO and any failure to purchase those minimum quantities will result in an additional payment from us to Fresenius-Kabi. We have other supply agreements in place for key raw materials used in the manufacture of FYARRO such as for the drug substance sirolimus and for human albumin, which are key ingredients in the drug product. If we were to engage another third-party manufacturer, we will be required to verify that the new third-party manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations. We will also need to verify, such as through a bridging study, that any new manufacturing process will produce FYARRO or any other product candidate we may develop in the future, if approved, according to the specifications previously submitted to the FDA or another regulatory authority. If we were to experience an unexpected loss of supply of FYARRO or any other product candidate that we may develop in the future for any reason, whether as a result of manufacturing, supply or storage issues or otherwise, we could experience delays, disruptions, suspensions or terminations in commercializing FYARRO for advanced malignant PEComa, or be required to restart or repeat, any pending or ongoing clinical trials for FYARRO in other indications or for any other product candidates we may develop in the future, in a timely manner or on budget. Moreover, if we are unable to keep up with demand for FYARRO, our revenue could be impaired, market acceptance for FYARRO could be adversely affected.\nWe expect to rely on third-party manufacturers for the commercial supply of FYARRO, and the continued development of FYARRO in other indications or any other product candidates we may develop in the future for which we obtain regulatory approval. We may be unable to maintain or establish required agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. Further, any delay in identifying and qualifying a manufacturer for commercial production could delay the potential commercialization of FYARRO, and, in the event that we do not have sufficient product to complete our planned clinical trials, it could delay such trials. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe failure of the third party to manufacture FYARRO or any of our other product candidates that we may develop in the future according to our schedule and specifications, or at all, including if our third-party contractors give greater priority to the supply of other products over our product candidates, are constrained by the recent COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of the agreements between us and them;\n\u2022\nthe termination or nonrenewal of arrangements or agreements by our third-party contractors at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us;\n\u2022\nthe breach by the third-party contractors of our agreements with them;\n\u2022\nthe failure of third-party contractors to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including manufacturing drug supply pursuant to strictly-enforced cGMPs;\n\u2022\nthe failure of the third-party contractor to manufacture FYARRO or any of our other product candidates that we may develop in the future according to our specifications;\n\u2022\nthe mislabeling of clinical supplies, potentially resulting in the wrong dose amounts being supplied or active drug or placebo not being properly identified;\n\u2022\nclinical supplies not being delivered to clinical sites on time, leading to clinical trial interruptions, or of drug supplies not being distributed to commercial vendors in a timely manner, resulting in lost sales; and\n\u2022\nthe misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how.\nWe do not have complete control over all aspects of the manufacturing process of our contract manufacturing partners and are dependent on these contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMP regulations for manufacturing both active pharmaceutical ingredients (\u201cAPI\u201d) and finished drug products. To date, we have obtained drug substance and drug product from third-party manufacturers to support preclinical and clinical testing of FYARRO. For example, we have obtained our supplies of FYARRO from a single source supplier, Fresenius-Kabi. We have supply agreements in place for key raw materials used in the manufacture of FYARRO such as for the drug substance sirolimus and for human albumin, which are key ingredients in the drug product. We are in the process of developing our supply chain for FYARRO, including through the Fresenius Agreement. As we commercialize FYARRO and advance FYARRO for additional indications or any other product candidates we may develop in the future through development, we will consider redundant supply for the API and drug product for FYARRO and each of our product candidates that we may develop in the future to protect against any potential\nsupply disruptions. However, we may be unsuccessful in putting in place such framework agreements or protecting against potential supply disruptions.\nThird-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside of the United States. If our CMOs cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA, EMA or others, they will not be able to pass a pre-approval inspection or secure and/or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities. In addition, we do not have control over the ability of our CMOs to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. Furthermore, many of our CMOs are engaged with other companies to supply and/or manufacture materials or products for such companies, which exposes our manufacturers to regulatory risks for the production of such materials and products. As a result, failure to satisfy the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may affect the regulatory clearance of our CMOs facilities generally. If the FDA, EMA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of FYARRO or any of our other product candidates that we may develop in the future or if we withdraws any such approval in the future, we will need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, and those new facilities would need to be inspected and approved by FDA, EMA or comparable regulatory authority prior to commencing manufacturing, which would significantly impact our ability to commercialize FYARRO for advanced malignant PEComa and develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market FYARRO for other indications or any of our other product candidates that we may develop in the future, if approved. Our reliance on CMOs also exposes us to the possibility that they, or third parties with access to their facilities, will have access to and may appropriate our trade secrets or other proprietary information. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on the parties, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates or drugs, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of FYARRO or any of our other product candidates or drugs that we may develop in the future and harm our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, the manufacture of pharmaceutical products is complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up and validating initial production and absence of contamination. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product, quality assurance testing, operator error, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. Furthermore, if contaminants are discovered in our supply of FYARRO or in our third-party manufacturing facilities, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination. Any stability or other issues relating to the manufacture of our product candidates may occur in the future. Further, as product candidates are developed through preclinical studies to late-stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives, and any of these changes could cause FYARRO or any of our other product candidates that we may develop in the future to perform differently and affect commercialization or the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials. In addition, quarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders, or the perception that such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations could occur, related to COVID-19 or other infectious diseases could impact personnel at our third-party manufacturing facilities upon which we rely, or the availability or cost of materials, which could disrupt the supply chain for FYARRO or any of our product candidates that we may develop in the future. Further, our manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations, our ability to provide our product candidate to patients in clinical trials would be jeopardized. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely.\nAny of these challenges could delay completion of clinical trials, require bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials, increase clinical study costs, delay approval of our product candidate, impair commercialization efforts, increase our cost of goods, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations, and growth prospects. Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of FYARRO and any of our other product candidates that we may develop in the future may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize FYARRO or any other product candidates that we may develop in the future that receives regulatory approval on a timely and competitive basis.\nWe are dependent on a single-source supplier for the drug product FYARRO, and the loss of such supplier could harm our business.\nWe rely on a single-source supplier, Fresenius-Kabi for our drug product FYARRO. In January 2022, we entered into the Fresenius Agreement, but will continue to place purchase orders from Fresenius-Kabi on an as-needed basis, subject to certain minimum quantities as agreed to under the Fresenius Agreement. The Fresenius Agreement is effective through December 22, 2022 (or such later date as may be agreed between the parties). We also have supply agreements in place for key raw materials used in the manufacture of FYARRO such as for the drug substance sirolimus and for human albumin, which are key ingredients in the drug product. Our suppliers could discontinue the manufacturing or supply of FYARRO at any time. We do not carry a significant inventory of FYARRO or our key raw materials used in the manufacture of FYARRO. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our demand for their products, either because of acts of nature, the nature of our agreements with those manufacturers or our relative importance to them as a customer, and our manufacturers may decide in the future to discontinue or reduce the level of business they conduct with us either entirely or for a particular territory. The loss of any of the foregoing would require significant time and effort to locate and qualify an alternative source of supply. We currently rely on a single company for such manufacturing for FYARRO. Any contractual disputes between us and such manufacturer, the termination of the Fresenius Agreement or loss of manufacturing ability by such manufacturer could similarly require significant time, effort and expense to locate and qualify an alternative source of manufacturing, which could materially harm our business.\nIn addition, we might not be able to identify and qualify additional or replacement suppliers for the drug product FYARRO or for the key raw materials used in the manufacture of FYARRO quickly or at all or without incurring significant additional costs. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to establish alternative relationships on similar terms, without delay or at all. We may also face regulatory delays or be required to seek additional regulatory clearances or approvals if we experience any delay or deficiency in the quality of products obtained from suppliers or if we have to replace our suppliers. In addition, we do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply of the drug product FYARRO or for the key raw materials used in the manufacture of FYARRO.\nEstablishing additional or replacement suppliers for the drug product FYARRO or for the key raw materials used in the manufacture of FYARRO, if required, or any supply interruption from our suppliers, could limit our ability to manufacture our products, result in production delays and increased costs and adversely affect our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis. Our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of the drug product FYARRO or for the key raw materials used in the manufacture of FYARRO also could adversely affect clinical development of FYARRO in other indications. If we are not able to identify alternate sources of supply for the drug product FYARRO or for the key raw materials used in the manufacture of FYARRO, we will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize FYARRO or any other product candidate that we may develop in the future or we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, regulatory approvals for FYARRO in other indications or for any other product candidates that we may develop in the future.\nThe manufacture of drugs is complex, and our third-party manufacturers may encounter difficulties in production. If any of our third-party manufacturers encounter such difficulties, our ability to provide adequate supply of FYARRO for patients or for clinical trials or any other product candidate that we may develop in the future, if approved, could be delayed or prevented.\nManufacturing drugs, especially in large quantities, is complex and highly regulated and may require the use of innovative technologies. Each lot of an approved drug product must undergo thorough testing for identity, strength, quality, purity and efficacy. Manufacturing drugs requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpose, as well as sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures. Manufacturing drugs is highly susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, improper installation or operation of equipment, vendor or operator error, inconsistency in yields, variability in product characteristics and difficulties in scaling the production process. Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures, product recalls or spoilage. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, we may be required to provide preclinical and\nclinical data showing the comparable identity, strength, quality, purity or efficacy of the products before and after such changes. If microbial, viral or other contaminations or impurities are discovered at the facilities of our manufacturer, such facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination or impurity, which could delay clinical trials and adversely harm our business. If our third-party manufacturers are unable to produce sufficient quantities of consistent quality for clinical trials or for commercialization as a result of these challenges, or otherwise, our development and commercialization efforts would be impaired, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe depend on intellectual property licensed from third parties and termination of any of these licenses could result in the loss of significant rights, which would harm our business.\nWe are dependent on patents, know-how and proprietary technology, both our own and licensed from others. We entered into a license agreement with Abraxis BioScience, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Celgene Corporation, now Bristol Myers Squibb Company (\u201cCelgene\u201d) pursuant to which we have licensed exclusive global rights to intellectual property and know-how related to FYARRO (the \u201cCelgene License\u201d). We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts or diligent efforts to commercialize products based on the licensed rights and to pay certain royalties based off our net sales, certain sublicense fees (such as with respect to our license agreement with EOC) and certain other fees. We may not meet these requirements, which could result in a loss or termination of any rights under such agreements. Any termination of these licenses will result in the loss of significant rights and will restrict our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe are generally also subject to all of the same risks with respect to protection of intellectual property that we license, as we are for intellectual property that we own, which are described above under \u201cRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property.\u201d If we or our licensors fail to adequately protect this intellectual property, our ability to commercialize products could suffer.\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials, research and studies.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct all of our preclinical studies and clinical trials. We currently rely on third parties, such as CROs, clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct, supervise and monitor our current or planned preclinical studies and clinical trials of FYARRO for additional indications, and we expect to continue to rely upon third parties to conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials of FYARRO for additional indications and other product candidates we may develop in the future. We enter into agreements with third parties that have a significant role in the conduct of our preclinical studies and clinical trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. These third parties are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we have limited ability to control the conduct of such third party, the amount or timing of resources that any such third party will devote to our preclinical studies and clinical trials and the management of data developed through preclinical studies and clinical trials. Communicating with outside parties can also be challenging, potentially leading to mistakes as well as difficulties in coordinating activities. The third parties we rely on for these services may also (i) have staffing difficulties, (ii) fail to comply with contractual obligations, (iii) experience regulatory compliance issues, (iv) undergo changes in priorities or become financially distressed, or (v) have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors, which may draw time and resources from our development programs. The third parties with whom we may contract might not be diligent, careful or timely in conducting our preclinical studies or clinical trials, resulting in the preclinical studies and clinical trials being delayed or unsuccessful. Some of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements with a third party, we would delay our drug development activities.\nOur reliance on these third parties for such drug development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. For example, we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial and legal, regulatory, and scientific requirements and standards. Moreover, the FDA requires us and our third parties to comply with applicable GLP and GCP standards, regulations for conducting, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to assure that the data and reported results are reliable and accurate and for clinical trials that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected and that they are adequately informed of the potential risks of\nparticipating in clinical trials. The EMA also requires us to comply with similar standards. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP requirements, the clinical data generated in our preclinical studies and clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional preclinical studies or clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our preclinical studies and clinical trials substantially comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product candidates produced under current cGMP regulations and will require a large number of test patients. Our failure or the failure of our CROs to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process and could also subject us to enforcement action up to and including civil and criminal penalties. We are also required to register certain ongoing clinical trials and post the results of certain completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.\nIf we cannot contract with acceptable third parties on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or perform preclinical studies and clinical trials in a satisfactory manner, meet expected deadlines or conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials in accordance with legal and regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, regulatory approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nWe entered into a collaboration agreement with EOC Pharma, and we may form or seek additional strategic alliances or collaborations in the future. Such alliances and collaborations may inhibit future opportunities, or we may not realize the benefits of such collaborations or alliances.\nIn December 2020, we granted to EOC exclusive rights to develop and commercialize FYARRO in the EOC Licensed Territory, pursuant to the EOC License, and we may form or seek strategic alliances, joint ventures or collaborations or enter into licensing arrangements with other third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to FYARRO or any future product candidates that we may develop. Under the EOC License Agreement, we received an upfront payment and are eligible to receive regulatory and sales-based milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain milestone events totaling $257 million. We are also eligible to earn tiered royalties based on annual net sales of FYARRO based upon the royalties we are obligated to pay Celgene for sales of products in the EOC Territory pursuant to the Celgene License, plus an additional single-digit percentage that is variable based on the level of annual net sales. EOC will be responsible for development, regulatory submissions, and commercialization in the EOC Territory. We retain our rights outside of the EOC Territory.\nFuture efforts for additional alliances or collaborations may also require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners, and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Furthermore, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenues or specific net income that justifies such transaction.\nWe depend on EOC to develop and commercialize FYARRO within the EOC Territory, and we have limited control over how EOC will conduct development and commercialization activities for FYARRO.\nUnder the EOC License Agreement, we rely on EOC for a substantial portion of the financial resources and for the development, regulatory, and commercialization activities for FYARRO in the EOC Territory, and we have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that EOC devotes to FYARRO. In addition, payments associated with development, regulatory and commercial milestones that we may be eligible to receive, as well as royalties, will be dependent upon further advancement of the FYARRO by EOC. If these milestones are not met and if FYARRO is not commercialized in the EOC Territory, we will not receive future revenues from the collaboration. EOC may fail to develop or effectively commercialize FYARRO for a variety of reasons and the EOC License Agreement subjects us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nEOC may not commit sufficient resources to the development, regulatory approval, marketing, or distribution of FYARRO;\n\u2022\nEOC may be unable to successfully complete the clinical development of FYARRO or obtain all necessary approvals from foreign regulatory agencies in the EOC Territory required to market FYARRO;\n\u2022\nEOC may terminate their agreement with us prior to completing development or commercialization of the FYARRO under the collaboration, in whole or in part, adversely impacting the potential approval and our revenue from the licensed product;\n\u2022\nour third-party manufacturer may be unable or unwilling to manufacture FYARRO in compliance with requirements of Chinese regulatory agencies, which would impact clinical development of FYARRO, and in commercial quantities sufficient to meet market demand;\n\u2022\nthere may be disputes between us and EOC, including disagreements regarding the EOC License Agreement with us, that may result in (1) the delay of (or prevent entirely) the achievement of development, regulatory and commercial objectives that would result in milestone payments, (2) the delay or termination of the development or commercialization of FYARRO in the EOC Territory, costly litigation or arbitration that diverts our management\u2019s attention and resources; and/or\n\u2022\ntermination of the underlying license agreement;\n\u2022\nEOC may not comply with applicable regulatory guidelines with respect to developing or commercializing FYARRO, which could adversely impact the development of or sales of FYARRO and could result in administrative or judicially imposed sanctions, including warning letters, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, product seizures or detention, product recalls, total or partial suspension of production and refusal to approve any new drug applications;\n\u2022\nEOC may experience financial difficulties;\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations or significant changes in either the business strategy of EOC may also adversely affect EOC\u2019s ability to perform its obligations under its license agreement with us;\n\u2022\nEOC may not properly maintain our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\nEOC may develop or commercialize FYARRO in a manner that may adversely impact our development or commercialization of FYARRO and/or future product candidates outside of such collaboration; and\n\u2022\nAlthough EOC is subject to a limited non-compete obligation, EOC could independently move forward with a competing product candidate developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including our competitors.\nIf EOC does not perform in the manner we expect or fulfill our responsibilities in a timely manner, or at all, the development, regulatory approval, and commercialization efforts related to FYARRO could be delayed. It may be necessary for us to assume the responsibility at our own expense for the development of FYARRO in the EOC Territory. In that event, we would likely need to seek additional funding and our potential to generate future revenues from FYARRO could be significantly reduced and our business could be materially and adversely harmed.\nWe have entered into collaborations with third parties in connection with the development of FYARRO. Even if we believe that the development of such product candidate is promising, our partners may choose not to proceed with such development.\nOur existing agreement with EOC, and any future collaboration agreements we may enter into, are generally subject to termination by the counterparty on short notice upon the occurrence of certain circumstances, including, in the case of EOC, without cause subject to a specified notice period. Accordingly, even if we believe that the development of product candidates is worth pursuing, our partners may choose not to continue with such development. If any of our collaborations are terminated, we may not receive additional milestones or royalties under those collaborations. In addition, we may be required to devote additional resources to the development of our product candidates or seek a new collaboration partner on short notice, and the terms of any additional collaboration or other arrangements that we establish may not be favorable to us.\nWe are also at risk that our current and any potential collaborations or other arrangements may not be successful. Factors that may affect the success of our collaborations include the following:\n\u2022\nOur collaboration partners may incur financial and cash flow difficulties that force them to limit or reduce their efforts under their collaboration agreement with us;\n\u2022\nOur collaboration partners may be pursuing alternative technologies or developing alternative products that are competitive to our technology and products, either on their own or in partnership with others;\n\u2022\nOur collaboration partners may terminate their collaboration with us, which could make it difficult for us to attract new partners or adversely affect perception of us in the business and financial communities; and\n\u2022\nOur collaboration partners may pursue higher priority programs or change the focus of their development programs, which could affect their commitment to us.\nIf we cannot maintain successful collaborations, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected.\nIf we engage in future acquisitions or strategic partnerships, this may increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities, and subject us to other risks.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate various acquisition opportunities and strategic partnerships, including licensing or acquiring complementary products, intellectual property rights, technologies, or businesses. Any potential acquisition or strategic partnership may entail numerous risks, including:\n\u2022increased operating expenses and cash requirements;\n\u2022the assumption of additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities;\n\u2022the issuance of our equity securities;\n\u2022\nassimilation of operations, intellectual property, and products of an acquired company, including difficulties associated with integrating new personnel;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our existing programs and initiatives in pursuing such a strategic merger or acquisition;\n\u2022\nretention of key employees, the loss of key personnel and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships;\n\u2022\nrisks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction, including the prospects of that party and their existing products or product candidates and regulatory approvals; and\n\u2022\nOur inability to generate revenue from acquired technology and/or products sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition or even to offset the associated acquisition and maintenance costs.\nIn addition, if we undertake acquisitions or pursue partnerships in the future, we may issue dilutive securities, assume or incur debt obligations, incur large one-time expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense.\nIf we decide to establish additional collaborations but are not able to establish those collaborations on commercially reasonable terms, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nOur drug development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses. We may seek to selectively form collaborations to expand our capabilities, potentially accelerate research and development activities and provide for commercialization activities by third parties. Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders, or disrupt our management and business.\nWe would face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed\ncollaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA, EMA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing drugs, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of intellectual property and industry and market conditions generally. The potential collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate. Further, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a collaboration or other alternative arrangements for product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view them as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy.\nIn addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators. Even if we are successful in entering into a collaboration, the terms and conditions of that collaboration may restrict us from entering into future agreements on certain terms with potential collaborators.\nIf and when we seek to enter into collaborations, we may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of a product candidate, reduce or delay our development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay our potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue.\nWe may enter into collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of product candidates. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of these product candidates.\nIf we enter into any collaboration arrangements with any third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities and efforts to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. Collaborations involving our product candidates would pose numerous risks to us, including the following:\n\u2022\ncollaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations and may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may deemphasize or not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus, including as a result of a business combination or sale or disposition of a business unit or development function, or available funding or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than us;\n\u2022\na collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to multiple products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of FYARRO or any other product candidate that we may develop in the future, if approved, relative to other products;\n\u2022\nWe may grant exclusive rights to our collaborators that would prevent us from collaborating with others;\n\u2022collaborators may not properly obtain, maintain, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights\nor may use our proprietary information and intellectual property in such a way as to invite litigation or other intellectual property related proceedings that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information and intellectual property or expose us to potential litigation or other intellectual property related proceedings;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between the collaborators and us that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates;\n\u2022\ncollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not provide us with timely and accurate information regarding development progress and activities under the collaboration or may limit our ability to share such information, which could adversely impact our ability to report progress to our investors and otherwise plan our own development of our product candidates;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our products that results from us collaborating with them, and in such cases, we would not have the exclusive right to develop or commercialize such intellectual property; and\n\u2022\na collaborator\u2019s sales and marketing activities or other operations may not be in compliance with applicable laws, resulting in civil or criminal proceedings.\nGeneral Risks\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations. From the completion of the Merger through December 31, 2021, the market price for our common stock ranged from a low of $18.75 to a high of $32.99. Market prices for securities of early-stage pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nOur ability to obtain regulatory approvals for FYARRO in other indications or for any other product candidates that we may develop in the future, and delays or failures to obtain such approvals;\n\u2022\nthe failure of FYARRO or any other product candidates that we may develop in the future, if approved for marketing and commercialization, to achieve commercial success;\n\u2022\nany inability to obtain adequate supply of our product candidates or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nthe entry into, or termination of, key agreements, including key licensing, supply or collaboration agreements;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory authority decisions;\n\u2022\nthe initiation of material developments in, or conclusion of, disputes or litigation to enforce or defend any of our intellectual property rights or defend against the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe results of current, and any future, nonclinical or clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nannouncements by commercial partners or competitors of new commercial products, clinical progress (or the lack thereof), significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed financial and development projections we may provide to the public;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed the financial and development projections of the investment community;\n\u2022\nthe perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including deteriorating market conditions due to investor concerns regarding inflation and hostilities between Russia and Ukraine;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity relating to our markets, including with respect to other products and potential products in such markets;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of technological innovations or new therapies competing with our potential products;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees;\n\u2022\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022\nif securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our business and stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions potentially affecting our research and development expenditures;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of health care payment systems;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory decisions;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies or the biotechnology sector. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Regardless of the merits or the ultimate results of such litigation, if instituted, such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nAdditionally, a decrease in our stock price may cause our common stock to no longer satisfy the continued listing standards of Nasdaq. If we are not able to maintain the requirements for listing on Nasdaq, we could be delisted, which could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds as well as the price and liquidity of our common stock.\nWe must maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, and if we are unable to do so, the accuracy and timeliness of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, and therefore will be able to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nWe must maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in order to accurately and timely report our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as a public company, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at the end of each fiscal year. We rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of legal and outsourced accounting professionals. As we grow, we plan to hire additional personnel and engage external temporary resources and may implement, document, and modify policies and procedures to maintain effective internal controls. However, we may identify deficiencies and weaknesses or fail to remediate previously identified deficiencies in our internal controls.\nThe rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. These stringent standards require that our audit committee be advised and regularly updated on management\u2019s review of internal control over financial reporting. Our management may not be able to effectively and timely implement controls and procedures that adequately respond to the increased regulatory compliance and reporting requirements that are applicable to us as a public company. If we fail to staff our accounting, finance and information technology functions adequately or maintain internal control over financial reporting adequate to meet the demands that are placed upon us as a public company, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our business and reputation may be harmed and our stock price may decline. Furthermore, investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected, which could cause a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nFinancial reporting obligations of being a public company in the United States are expensive and time- consuming, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance matters.\nFollowing the recently completed Merger, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses as a publicly traded company that we did not incur as a privately-held company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. The obligations of being a public company in the United States require significant expenditures and place significant demands on our management and other personnel, including costs resulting from public company reporting obligations under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations regarding corporate governance practices, including those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) and the Nasdaq listing requirements. These rules require the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and procedures, internal control over financial reporting and changes in corporate governance practices, among many other complex rules that are often difficult to implement, monitor and maintain compliance with. For example, our management team consists of executive officers and other personnel of the operating company that survived the Merger prior to the Merger, some of whom have not previously managed and operated a public company. Thus, our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements and to keep pace with new regulations, otherwise we may fall out of compliance and risk becoming subject to litigation or being delisted, among other potential problems. In addition, these rules and regulations may also make it difficult and expensive for us to obtain and maintain director\u2019s and officer\u2019s liability insurance. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers, which may adversely affect investor confidence in and could cause our business or stock price to suffer.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq.\nIf Nasdaq delists our shares of common stock from trading on its exchange for failure to meet Nasdaq\u2019s listing standards, we and our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences including:\n\u2022\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u2022\nreduced liquidity for our securities;\n\u2022\na determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u2022\na limited amount of new and analyst coverage; and\n\u2022\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our common stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur executive officers, directors, holders of 5% or more of our capital stock and their respective affiliates beneficially owned a significant portion of our outstanding voting stock.\nThese stockholders, acting together, may be able to impact matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, they may be able to impact the elections of directors, amendments to our organizational documents or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the\ninterests of other stockholder and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nUnfavorable global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by war, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties, other business interruptions, and by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including, weakened demand for our product candidates and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for our services. In the event of prolonged business interruptions due to geopolitical events, we could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume our business or clinical operations. We have no operations in Russia or the Ukraine, but we do not and cannot know if the current uncertainties in these geopolitical areas, which are unfolding in real-time, may escalate and result in broad economic and security conditions or rationing of medical supplies, which could limit our ability to conduct clinical trials outside the U.S. or result in material implications for our business. In addition, our insurance policies typically contain a war exclusion of some description and we do not know how our insurers are likely to respond in the event of a loss alleged to have been caused by geopolitical uncertainties. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, our operations and performance may be affected by political or civil unrest or military action, including the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorist activity, unstable governments and legal systems. As a result of global economic conditions, some third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. Job losses or other economic hardships may also affect patients\u2019 ability to afford healthcare as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. Our ability to conduct clinical trials in regions experiencing political or civil unrest could negatively affect clinical trial enrollment or the timely completion of a clinical trial. We believe the aforementioned economic conditions could lead to reduced demand for our drug products, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, business and results of operations.\nWe are a smaller reporting company. We cannot be certain whether the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors or otherwise limit our ability to raise additional funds.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under applicable securities regulations. A smaller reporting company is a company that, as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter, has an aggregate market value of the company\u2019s voting stock held by non-affiliates, or public float, of less than $250 million, or has at least $100 million in revenue and at least $700 million in public float. SEC rules provide that companies with a non-affiliate public float of less than $75 million may only sell shares under a Form S-3 shelf registration statement, during any 12-month period, in an amount less than or equal to one-third of the public float. If we do not meet this public float requirement, any offering by us under a Form S-3 will be limited to raising an aggregate of one-third of our public float in any 12-month period. In addition, a smaller reporting company is able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in its filings, is exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that an independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting if its public float is less than $75 million, and has certain other reduced disclosure obligations in our SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Reduced disclosure in our SEC filings due to our status as a smaller reporting company may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe current expectation is that we will retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain, if any, for the foreseeable future.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports, about us, our business or our market, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or equity research analysts publish about us and our business. Equity research analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the event we do have equity research analyst coverage, we will not have any control over the analysts, or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts our stockholders to replace or remove our management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay or prevent an acquisition or a change in management. These provisions include a classified board of directors, a prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders, and the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), which prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us in certain circumstances. Although we believe these provisions collectively will provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove then current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of management.\nOur bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur amended and restated by-laws provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) is the sole and exclusive forum for any state law claims for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees or our stockholders to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provisions of the DGCL, or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our by-laws (including the interpretation, validity or enforceability thereof), or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine; provided, that these choice of forum provisions do not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. The amended and restated bylaws provide that the federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the by-laws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our by-laws described above\nWe are a California-domiciled public company and are required to have at least two or three women on our board of directors at the end of 2021, depending on the size of our board at the time.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified individuals to our board of directors. As a public company headquartered in California, we were required to have two or three women on our board of directors by the end of 2021, depending on the size of our board of directors at the time. We currently have seven seats on our board of directors which will require us to have at least three women on our\nboard of directors by the end of 2021. While we currently have two women on the board of directors, recruiting and retaining board members carries uncertainty, and failure to comply with this California requirement may result in financial penalties, ranging from $100,000 to $300,000. To date, the Secretary of State of the State of California has neither adopted regulations regarding fines or imposed fines for violations.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including violating applicable regulatory standards and requirements or engaging in insider trading, which could significantly harm our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA and applicable non-U.S. regulators, provide accurate information to the FDA and applicable non-U.S. regulators, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. Employees may also unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary and/or confidential information to competitors. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of, including trading on, information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of conduct, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may be ineffective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending our self or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.", "PERMNO": 17869, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ARPO"}
