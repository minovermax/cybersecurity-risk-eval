{"cik": "1326706", "company": "NanoVibronix, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before purchasing our securities. If any of the following risks actually occur, they may materially harm our business and our financial condition and results of operations. In any such event, the market price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have a history of losses and we expect to continue to incur losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, we had a net loss of $2,647,000, with revenues of $203,000. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $16,850,000 and a total stockholders\u2019 deficit of $5,616,000. We expect to incur losses for at least the next year, as we continue to incur expenses related to seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for WoundShield and seek market acceptance of PainShield, which will require costly clinical trials and research, further product development and professional fees associated with regulatory compliance. Even if we succeed in commercializing our new products, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to cover our expenses and achieve sustained profitability or be able to maintain profitability.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital, our clinical trials and product development will be limited and our long-term viability will be threatened; however, if we do raise additional capital, your percentage ownership as a stockholder could decrease and constraints could be placed on the operations of our business.\nWe have experienced negative operating cash flows since our inception and have funded our operations primarily from proceeds of the sale of our securities, with only limited revenue being generated from our product sales. We will seek to obtain additional funds in the future through equity or debt financings, or strategic alliances with third parties, either alone or in combination with equity financings. These financings could result in substantial dilution to the holders of our common stock, or require contractual or other restrictions on our operations or on alternatives that may be available to us. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities could impose significant restrictions on our operations through the imposition of restrictive covenants and requiring us to pledge assets in order to secure repayment. In addition, if we raise funds through the sale of equity, we may issue equity securities with rights superior to our common stock, including voting rights, rights to proceeds upon our liquidation or sale, rights to dividends and rights to appoint board members. Any such required financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, and the failure to procure such required financing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, or threaten our ability to continue as a going concern.\nA variety of factors could impact the timing and amount of any required financings, including, without limitation:\n\u00b7 unforeseen developments during our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 delays in our receipt of required regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 delayed market acceptance of our products;\n\u00b7 unanticipated expenditures in our acquisition and defense of intellectual property rights, and/or the loss of those rights;\n\u00b7 the failure to develop strategic alliances for the marketing of some of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 unforeseen changes in healthcare reimbursement for any of our approved products;\n\u00b7 lack of financial resources to adequately support our operations;\n\u00b7 difficulties in maintaining commercial scale manufacturing capacity and capability;\n\u00b7 unanticipated difficulties in operating in international markets;\n\u00b7 unanticipated financial resources needed to respond to technological changes and increased competition;\n\u00b7 unforeseen problems in attracting and retaining qualified personnel;\n\u00b7 enactment of new legislation or administrative regulations;\n\u00b7 the application to our business of new regulatory interpretations;\n\u00b7 claims that might be brought in excess of our insurance coverage;\n\u00b7 the failure to comply with regulatory guidelines; and\n\u00b7 the uncertainty in industry demand.\nIn addition, although we have no present commitments or understandings to do so, we may seek to expand our operations and product line through acquisitions or joint ventures. Any acquisition or joint venture would likely increase our capital requirements.\nIf we fail to obtain an adequate level of reimbursement for our approved products by third party payers, there may be no commercially viable markets for our approved products or the markets may be much smaller than expected.\nThe availability and levels of reimbursement by governmental and other third party payers affect the market for our approved products. The efficacy, safety, performance and cost-effectiveness of our product and product candidates, and of any competing products, will determine the availability and level of reimbursement. Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and include both government sponsored healthcare and private insurance. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to produce clinical data, which may involve one or more clinical trials, that compares the cost-effectiveness of our approved products to other available therapies. We may not obtain reimbursement or pricing approvals in markets we seek to enter in a timely manner, if at all. Our failure to receive reimbursement or pricing approvals in target markets would negatively impact market acceptance of our products in these jurisdictions, placing us at a material cost disadvantage to our competitors.\nEven if we obtain reimbursement approvals for our products, we believe that, in the future, reimbursement for any of our products or product candidates may be subject to increased restrictions both in the U.S. and in international markets. Future legislation, regulation or policies of third party payers that limit reimbursement may adversely affect the demand for our products currently under development and our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. In addition, third party payers continually attempt to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare by challenging the prices charged for healthcare products and services.\nIn the U.S., specifically, health care providers, such as hospitals and clinics, and individual patients, generally rely on third-party payers. Third-party reimbursement is dependent upon decisions by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, contracted Medicare carriers or intermediaries, individual managed care organizations, private insurers, foreign governmental health programs and other payers of health care costs. Failure to receive or maintain favorable coding, coverage and reimbursement determinations for our products by these organizations could discourage medical practitioners from using or prescribing our products due to their costs. In addition, with recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health care reform including the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid entitlement programs, and on the cost of medical products and services, which could limit reimbursement. Additionally, third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. We may be unable to sell our products on a profitable basis if third-party payers deny coverage, provide low reimbursement rates or reduce their current levels of reimbursement.\nThe medical device and therapeutic product industries are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. If our competitors are better able to develop and market products that are safer and more effective than any products we may develop, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain a competitive position in the development of technologies and products. We face competition from established medical device companies, such as Misonix Inc., Celleration Inc., Kinetic Concepts, Inc. and Smith & Nephew plc, manufacturers of certain portable ultrasound devices capable of self-administered use, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions in the U.S. and abroad. Most, if not all, of our principal competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, marketing approved products, protecting and defending their intellectual property rights and designing around the intellectual property rights of others. Other small or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements, or mergers with, or acquisitions by, large and established companies, or through the development of novel products and technologies.\nThe industry in which we operate has undergone, and we expect it to continue to undergo, rapid and significant technological change, and we expect competition to intensify as technological advances are made. Our competitors may be able to respond to changes in technology or the marketplace faster than us. Our competitors may develop and commercialize medical devices that are safer or more effective or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. We also compete with our competitors in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, in establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, and in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business. Given our small size and lack of resources, we are often at a disadvantage with our competitors in all of these areas, which could limit or eliminate our commercial opportunities.\nWe face the risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain insurance.\nOur business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the development of medical devices and products. If the use of one or more of our products harms people, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims brought against us by clinical trial participants, consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling our products. We currently carry clinical trial and product liability insurance for the products we sell. However, we cannot predict all of the possible harms or side effects that may result and, therefore, the amount of insurance coverage we hold may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we might incur. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of additional commercial products as we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in development and as our sales expand, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for such products. If we are unable to obtain insurance at an acceptable cost or otherwise protect against potential product liability claims and we continue to make sales, or if our coverages turns out to be insufficient, we may be exposed to significant liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial position. If we are sued for any injury allegedly caused by our or our collaborators\u2019 products and do not have sufficient insurance coverage, our liability could exceed our total assets and our ability to pay the liability. A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us would decrease our cash and could reduce our value or marketability.\nOur product candidates may not be developed or commercialized successfully.\nOur product candidates are based on a technology that has not been used previously in the manner we propose and must compete with more established treatments currently accepted as the standards of care. Market acceptance of our products will largely depend on our ability to demonstrate their relative safety, efficacy, cost-effectiveness and ease of use.\nWe are subject to the risks that:\n\u00b7 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or a foreign regulatory authority finds our product candidates ineffective or unsafe;\n\u00b7 we do not receive necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 the regulatory review and approval process may take much longer than anticipated, requiring additional time, effort and expense to respond to regulatory comments and/or directives;\n\u00b7 we are unable to get our product candidates in commercial quantities at reasonable costs; and\n\u00b7 the patient and physician community does not accept our product candidates.\nIn addition, our product development program may be curtailed, redirected, eliminated or delayed at any time for many reasons, including:\n\u00b7 adverse or ambiguous results;\n\u00b7 undesirable side effects that delay or extend the trials;\n\u00b7 the inability to locate, recruit, qualify and retain a sufficient number of clinical investigators or patients for our trials; and\n\u00b7 regulatory delays or other regulatory actions.\nAdditionally, we currently have limited experience in marketing or selling our products, and we have a limited marketing and sales staff and distribution capabilities. Developing a marketing and sales force is time-consuming and will involve the investment of significant amounts of financial and management resources, and could delay the launch of new products or expansion of existing product sales. In addition, we compete with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. If we fail to establish successful marketing and sales capabilities or fail to enter into successful marketing arrangements with third parties, our ability to generate revenues will suffer.\nFurthermore, even if we enter into marketing and distributing arrangements with third parties, we may have limited or no control over the sales, marketing and distribution activities of these third parties, and these third parties may not be successful or effective in selling and marketing our products. If we fail to create successful and effective marketing and distribution channels, our ability to generate revenue and achieve our anticipated growth could be adversely affected. If these distributors experience financial or other difficulties, sales of our products could be reduced, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe cannot predict whether we will successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates. If we fail to do so, we will not be able to generate substantial revenues, if any.\nThe loss of our key management would likely hinder our ability to execute our business plan.\nAs a small company with seven full-time employees and four part-time employees, our success depends on the continuing contributions of our management team and qualified personnel and on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We face intense competition in our hiring efforts from other medical device companies, as well as from universities and nonprofit research organizations, and we may have to pay higher salaries to attract and retain qualified personnel. We are also at a disadvantage in recruiting and retaining key personnel as our small size and limited resources may be viewed as providing a less stable environment, with fewer opportunities than would be the case at one of our larger competitors. The loss of one or more of these individuals, or our inability to attract additional qualified personnel, could substantially impair our ability to implement our business plan.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our solutions, weaken our competitive position and reduce our revenue.\nWe regard the protection of our intellectual property, which includes patents and patent applications, trade secrets, trademarks and domain names, as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. However, these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information or deter independent development of similar technologies by others.\nWe have obtained patents and we have patent applications pending in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that our patent applications will be approved, that any patents issued will adequately protect our intellectual property, or that these patents will not be challenged by third parties or found to be invalid or unenforceable. We have also obtained trademark registration in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. Effective trade secret, trademark and patent protection is expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and the costs of defending our rights. We may be required to protect our intellectual property in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful or which we may not pursue in every location. We may, over time, increase our investment in protecting our intellectual property through additional patent filings that could be expensive and time-consuming.\nMonitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly. Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. We may not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Further, our competitors may independently develop technologies that are similar to ours but which avoid the scope of our intellectual property rights. Further, the laws in the U.S. and elsewhere change rapidly, and any future changes could adversely affect us and our intellectual property. Our failure to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could result in competitors offering solutions that incorporate our most technologically advanced features, which could seriously reduce demand for our products. In addition, we may in the future need to initiate infringement claims or litigation. Litigation, whether we are a plaintiff or a defendant, can be expensive, time-consuming and may divert the efforts of our technical staff and managerial personnel, which could harm our business, whether or not the litigation results in a determination that is unfavorable to us. In addition, litigation is inherently uncertain, and thus we may not be able to stop our competitors from infringing our intellectual property rights.\nWe could incur substantial costs and disruption to our business as a result of any claim of infringement of another party\u2019s intellectual property rights, which could harm our business and operating results.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation in the U.S. over patents and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, we may face allegations that we or customers who use our products have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including allegations made by our competitors or by non-practicing entities. We cannot predict whether assertions of third party intellectual property rights or claims arising from these assertions will substantially harm our business and operating results. If we are forced to defend any infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit or are ultimately determined in our favor, we may face costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. Most of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do and are able to sustain the cost of complex intellectual property litigation to a greater extent and for longer periods of time than we could. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us, among other things: to pay damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party\u2019s patent or other intellectual property rights; to cease making, licensing or using products that are alleged to incorporate or make use of the intellectual property of others; to expend additional development resources to redesign our products; and to enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the rights to use necessary technologies. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In any event, we may need to license intellectual property which would require us to pay royalties or make one-time payments. Even if these matters do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and resources necessary to resolve them could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and reputation.\nWe could be subject to litigation related to our terminated license agreement for NanoVibronix NPWT.\nWe licensed the technology that was the basis of our negative wound pressure pump, NanoVibronix NPWT. Under the license agreement, we had the exclusive license to manufacture, market, sell, lease and distribute the technology within the U.S. until June 29, 2014, after which date, the license agreement terminated and we ceased selling this product. Following such termination, the licensor sent us a letter requesting a payment of approximately $75,000 under the license agreement. We responded disputing that any further payment is due. Although we do not believe we owe any further payment, there can be no guarantee that the licensor will not take further actions in this matter, including initiating litigation against us, nor any guaranty as to the ultimate outcome of such actions. Even if this matter does not result in litigation or is resolved in our favor, the time and resources necessary to resolve this dispute could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and reputation.\nRisks Related to the Regulation of Our Products\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation, including the requirement of U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval or clearance, before our product candidates may be marketed.\nThe process of obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval is lengthy, expensive and uncertain, and we cannot be sure that our product candidates will be approved in a timely fashion, or at all. If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not approve or clear our product candidates in a timely fashion, or at all, our business and financial condition would likely be adversely affected.\nBoth before and after approval or clearance of our product candidates, we, our product candidates, our suppliers and our contract manufacturers are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. Failure to comply with applicable requirements could result in, among other things, any of the following actions:\n\u00b7 warning letters;\n\u00b7 fines and other monetary penalties;\n\u00b7 unanticipated expenditures;\n\u00b7 delays in U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval and clearance, or U.S. Food and Drug Administration refusal to approve or clear a product candidate;\n\u00b7 product recall or seizure;\n\u00b7 interruption of manufacturing or clinical trials;\n\u00b7 operating restrictions;\n\u00b7 injunctions; and\n\u00b7 criminal prosecutions.\nIn addition to the approval and clearance requirements, numerous other regulatory requirements apply, both before and after approval or clearance, to us, our products and product candidates, and our suppliers and contract manufacturers. These include requirements related to the following:\n\u00b7 testing;\n\u00b7 manufacturing;\n\u00b7 quality control;\n\u00b7 labeling;\n\u00b7 advertising;\n\u00b7 promotion;\n\u00b7 distribution;\n\u00b7 export;\n\u00b7 reporting to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration certain adverse experiences associated with the use of the products; and\n\u00b7 obtaining additional approvals or clearances for certain modifications to the products or their labeling or claims.\nWe are also subject to inspection by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to determine our compliance with regulatory requirements, as are our suppliers and contract manufacturers, and we cannot be sure that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will not identify compliance issues that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s requirements may change and additional government regulations may be promulgated that could affect us, our product candidates, and our suppliers and contract manufacturers. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations in the future, or that such laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect upon our business.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions will prevent us from marketing our products abroad.\nInternational sales of our products and any of our product candidates that we commercialize are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country in which the products are sold. Accordingly, the introduction of our product candidates in markets outside the U.S. where we do not already possess regulatory approval will be subject to regulatory approvals in those jurisdictions. The regulatory review process varies from country to country. Many countries impose product standards, packaging and labeling requirements, and import restrictions on medical devices. In addition, each country has its own tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements, as well as reimbursement and healthcare payment systems. The approval by foreign government authorities is unpredictable and uncertain, and can be expensive. We may be required to perform additional pre-clinical, clinical or post-approval studies even if U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval has been obtained. Our ability to market our approved products could be substantially limited due to delays in receipt of, or failure to receive, the necessary approvals or clearances.\nWe are uncertain regarding the success of our clinical trials for our products in development.\nWe believe that all of our products in development will require clinical trials to determine their safety and efficacy by regulatory bodies in their target markets, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and various foreign regulators. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete the U.S. and foreign regulatory approval processes for products in development. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter additional problems that will cause us to delay, suspend or terminate our clinical trials. In addition, we cannot make any assurance that clinical trials will be deemed sufficient in size and scope to satisfy regulatory approval requirements, or, if completed, will ultimately demonstrate our products to be safe and efficacious.\nThe adoption of healthcare reform in the U.S. may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOn March 23, 2010, President Obama signed into law major healthcare reform legislation under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or the PPACA, which was modified on March 30, 2010 by the enactment of the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Under the PPACA, it is expected that expanded healthcare coverage will be made available to an additional 30 million Americans. The increased costs to the U.S. government from the PPACA are expected to be funded through a combination of payment reductions for providers over time and several new taxes. The PPACA imposes, among other things, an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the U.S. beginning in 2013, resulting in an anticipated cost to the medical device industry of up to $20 billion over the next decade. We believe that we will be exempt from this excise tax with respect to PainShield under the exemption for devices of a \u201ctype which is generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use.\u201d We will also need to assess whether we are subject to it with respect to other products when they are approved for sale in the U.S. The PPACA also provides for the establishment of an Independent Medicare Advisory Board that could recommend changes in payment for physicians under certain circumstances beginning in 2014. In addition, the PPACA authorizes certain voluntary demonstration projects beginning no later than 2013 around development of bundling payments for acute, inpatient hospital services, physician services, and post acute services for episodes of hospital care. The PPACA increases fraud and abuse penalties and expands the scope and reach of the Federal Civil False Claims Act and government enforcement tools, which may adversely impact healthcare companies.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court heard a constitutional challenge to the PPACA and in June 2012 held that the PPACA is constitutional. However, states are allowed to opt out of the expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid under the PPACA. In addition to the PPACA, the effect of which cannot presently be quantified given its recent enactment, various healthcare reform proposals have also emerged at the state level. We cannot predict whether future healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us. However, we anticipate that the PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and an additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, and could adversely affect our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Insurers may also refuse to provide any coverage of uses of approved products for medical indications other than those for which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted market approvals, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, possibly materially.\nIf we fail to comply with the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA provision of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibits the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing or arranging for, or recommending the ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services payable by Medicare, Medicaid or any other federal healthcare program. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is very broad in scope and many of its provisions have not been uniformly or definitively interpreted by existing case law or regulations. In addition, most of the states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these laws are even broader than the federal Anti-Kickback Statute in that their prohibitions are not limited to items or services paid for by federal healthcare programs, but instead apply regardless of the source of payment. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.\nAll of our financial relationships with healthcare providers and others who provide products or services to federal healthcare program beneficiaries are potentially governed by the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws. We believe our operations are in compliance with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws. However, we cannot be certain that we will not be subject to investigations or litigation alleging violations of these laws, which could be time-consuming and costly to us and could divert management\u2019s attention from operating our business, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if our arrangements were found to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or similar state laws, the consequences of such violations would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Organization and Our Securities\nWe are currently controlled by our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, and our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders have significant influence regarding all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\nAs of March 25, 2015, our directors, executive officers and 5% or greater stockholders beneficially owned approximately 57% of our voting capital stock, assuming the conversion of all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock (other than our series C preferred stock) and all outstanding convertible indebtedness, including accrued interest, which will occur automatically upon the effectiveness of our Form 10, which we anticipate will occur on April 10, 2015, and assuming a March 25, 2015 conversion date. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to exercise significant influence with respect to all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, will exercise significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other business combination or reorganization. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of us on terms that other stockholders may desire. The interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders, and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, and might affect the prevailing market price for our securities.\nThe price of our securities may be volatile, and the market price of our securities may drop below the price you pay.\nThere is currently no active market for our securities. Even if such a market develops and continues, the price of such securities nevertheless may be volatile. Market prices for securities of early-stage medical device companies have historically been particularly volatile. The factors that may cause the market price of our securities to fluctuate include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7 progress, or lack of progress, in developing and commercializing our products;\n\u00b7 favorable or unfavorable decisions about our products or intellectual property from government regulators, insurance companies or other third-party payers;\n\u00b7 our ability to recruit and retain qualified regulatory and research and development personnel;\n\u00b7 changes in investors\u2019 and securities analysts\u2019 perception of the business risks and conditions of our business;\n\u00b7 changes in our relationship with key collaborators;\n\u00b7 changes in the market valuation or earnings of our competitors or companies viewed as similar to us;\n\u00b7 changes in key personnel;\n\u00b7 depth of the trading market in our common stock;\n\u00b7 changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u00b7 the granting or exercise of employee stock options or other equity awards;\n\u00b7 realization of any of the risks described under this section entitled \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors\u201d; and\n\u00b7 general market and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the equity markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the securities of newly public companies for a number of reasons, including reasons that may be unrelated to our business or operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may result in a material decline in the market price of our securities and you may not be able to sell your common stock at prices you deem acceptable. In the past, following periods of volatility in the equity markets, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against public companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial cost and the diversion of management attention.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception that future sales may occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock. Our stockholders and the holders of our options and warrants may sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market. The availability of these shares of our common stock for resale in the public market has the potential to cause the supply of our common stock to exceed investor demand, thereby decreasing the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, the fact that our stockholders, option holders and warrant holders can sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, could make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nAn active trading market may not develop for our securities.\nThere is no established trading market for our securities, and the market for our securities may be highly volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance. An active public market for our securities may not develop or be sustained. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our company will lead to the development of an active trading market in our common stock or how liquid that market might become. If a market does not develop or is not sustained, it may be difficult for you to sell your securities at the time you wish to sell them, at a price that is attractive to you, or at all.\nWe will incur significant increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission and The Nasdaq Stock Market, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these new compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. We expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage.\nWe are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal controls over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may have one or more material weaknesses, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal controls and attestations of the effectiveness of internal controls by independent auditors. We would be required to perform the annual review and evaluation of our internal controls no later than in connection with our second annual report on Form 10-K filing. However, we initially expect to qualify as a smaller reporting company and as an emerging growth company, and thus, we would be exempt from the auditors\u2019 attestation requirement until such time as we no longer qualify as a smaller reporting company and an emerging growth company. We would no longer qualify as a smaller reporting company if the market value of our public float exceeded $75 million as of the last day of our second fiscal quarter in any fiscal year. We would no longer qualify as an emerging growth company at such time as described in the risk factor immediately below.\nWe are in the early stages of the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to evaluate and correct a material weakness in internal controls needed to comply with Section 404. The material weakness relates to our being a small company with a limited number of employees which limits our ability to assert the controls related to the segregation of duties. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWhile we currently qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the Jumpstart of Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, we could lose that status, which may increase the costs and demands placed upon our management.\nWe will continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of $1 billion (as indexed for inflation); (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common stock in an offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u2018large accelerated filer,\u2019 as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which would generally occur upon our attaining a public float of at least $700 million. Once we lose emerging growth company status, we expect the costs and demands placed upon our management to increase, as we would have to comply with additional disclosure and accounting requirements, particularly if we would also no longer qualify as a smaller reporting company.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain that the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nThe JOBS Act permits \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d like us to rely on some of the reduced disclosure requirements that are already available to smaller reporting companies. As long as we qualify as an emerging growth company or a smaller reporting company, we would be permitted to omit the auditor\u2019s attestation on internal control over financial reporting that would otherwise be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as described above and are also exempt from the requirement to submit \u201csay-on-pay\u201d, \u201csay-on-pay frequency\u201d and \u201csay-on-parachute\u201d votes to our stockholders and may avail ourselves of reduced executive compensation disclosure that is already available to smaller reporting companies.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as long as we are an emerging growth company. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this until we are no longer an emerging growth company or until we affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of this exemption. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nWe will cease to be an emerging growth company at such time as described in the risk factor immediately above. Until such time, however, we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile and could cause our stock price to decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove the current members of our board and management.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws that will be in effect upon the effectiveness of our Form 10, which we anticipate will occur on April 10, 2015, could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. Furthermore, these provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our securities, thereby depressing the market price of our securities. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. These provisions, among other things:\n\u00b7 allow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u00b7 authorize our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock, the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the board of directors and that, if issued, could operate as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that our board of directors does not approve;\n\u00b7 establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our board of directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings; and\n\u00b7 limit who may call a stockholder meeting.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law that may, unless certain criteria are met, prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of the voting rights on our common stock, from merging or combining with us for a prescribed period of time.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities and their trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our securities will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us the trading price for our securities would be negatively affected. In the event we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our securities, the price of our securities would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, interest in the purchase of our securities could decrease, which could cause the price of our securities and their trading volume to decline.\nWe may be subject to ongoing restrictions related to grants from the Israeli Office of the Chief Scientist.\nThrough our Israeli subsidiary, we received grants of $436,815 from the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor, or the Office of the Chief Scientist, for research and development programs related to products that we are not currently commercializing or marketing. Because we are no longer developing the product to which the grants relate, we do not believe that we are subject to any material conditions with respect to the grants, except for the restrictions on our ability to make certain transfers of the technology or intellectual property related to these grants described below. We could in the future determine to apply for further grants. If we receive any such grants, we would have to comply with specified conditions, including paying royalties with respect to grants received. If we fail to comply with these conditions in the future, sanctions might be imposed on us, such as grants could be cancelled and we could be required to refund any payments previously received under these programs.\nPursuant to the Israeli Encouragement of Industrial Research and Development Law, any products developed with grants from the Office of the Chief Scientist are required to be manufactured in Israel and certain payments may be required in connection with the change of control of the grant recipient and the financing, mortgaging, production, exportation, licensing and transfer or sale of its technology and intellectual property to third parties, which will require the Office of the Chief Scientist\u2019s prior consent and, in case such a third party is outside of Israel, extended royalties and/or other fees. This could have a material adverse effect on and significant cash flow consequences to us if, and when, any technologies, intellectual property or manufacturing rights are exported, transferred or licensed to third parties outside Israel. If the Office of the Chief Scientist does not wish to give its consent in any required situation or transaction, we would need to negotiate a resolution with the Office of the Chief Scientist. In any event, such a transaction, assuming it was approved by the Office of the Chief Scientist, would involve monetary payments, such as royalties or fees, of not less than the applicable funding received from the Office of the Chief Scientist plus interest, not to exceed, in aggregate, six times the applicable funding received from the Office of the Chief Scientist.\nBecause we do not expect to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future, you must rely on appreciation of our common stock price for any return on your investment. Even if we change that policy, we may be restricted from paying dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial performance, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, you will have to rely on capital appreciation, if any, to earn a return on your investment in our common stock. Investors seeking cash dividends in the foreseeable future should not purchase our common stock.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nOur ability to utilize our federal net operating loss, carryforwards and federal tax credit may be limited under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The limitations apply if an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined by Section 382, occurs. Generally, an ownership change occurs if the percentage of the value of the stock that is owned by one or more direct or indirect \u201cfive percent shareholders\u201d increases by more than 50% over their lowest ownership percentage at any time during the applicable testing period (typically three years). If we have experienced an \u201cownership change\u201d at any time since our formation, we may already be subject to limitations on our ability to utilize our existing net operating losses and other tax attributes to offset taxable income. In addition, future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an \u201cownership change\u201d and, consequently, Section 382 and 383 limitations. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\nRisks Related to our Operations in Israel\nWe conduct our operations in Israel and therefore our results may be adversely affected by political, economic and military instability in Israel and its region.\nOur principal offices are located in Israel and most of our officers, employees and directors are residents of Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel and the surrounding region may directly affect our business. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Any hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade within Israel or between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect our operations and results of operations and could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. During the winter of 2012, Israel was engaged in an armed conflict with Hamas, a militia group and political party operating in the Gaza Strip. This conflict involved missile strikes against civilian targets in various parts of Israel and negatively affected business conditions in Israel. Recent political uprisings and civil resistance demonstrations in various countries in the Middle East, including Egypt and Syria, are affecting the political stability of those countries. It is not clear how this instability, or the Arab Spring in general, will develop and how it will affect the political and security situation in the Middle East. This instability may lead to deterioration of the political relationships that exist between Israel and these countries, and have raised concerns regarding security in the region and the potential for armed conflict. In addition, it is widely believed that Iran, which has previously threatened to attack Israel, has been stepping up its efforts to achieve nuclear capability. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The tension between Israel and Iran and/or these groups may escalate in the future and turn violent, which could affect the Israeli economy generally and us in particular. Any armed conflicts, terrorist activities or political instability in the region could adversely affect business conditions and could harm our results of operations. For example, any major escalation in hostilities in the region could result in a portion of our employees being called up to perform military duty for an extended period of time. Parties with whom we do business have sometimes declined to travel to Israel during periods of heightened unrest or tension, forcing us to make alternative arrangements when necessary.\nOur commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with the security situation in the Middle East. Although the Israeli government currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot assure you that this government coverage will be maintained. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any armed conflicts or political instability in the region would likely negatively affect business conditions and could harm our results of operations.\nFurther, in the past, the State of Israel and Israeli companies have been subjected to an economic boycott. Several countries still restrict business and trade activity with the State of Israel and with Israeli companies. These restrictive laws and policies may have an adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition or the expansion of our business.\nOur operations may be disrupted as a result of the obligation of management or personnel to perform military service.\nMany of our male employees in Israel, including members of our senior management, perform up to one month, and in some cases more, of annual military reserve duty until they reach the age of 45 or older and, in the event of a military conflict, may be called to active duty. There have also been periods of significant call-ups of military reservists, and it is possible that there will be military reserve duty call-ups in the future. Our operations could be disrupted by the absence of a significant number of our employees. Such disruption could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause a certain portion of our expenses is incurred in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our results of operations may be harmed by currency fluctuations and inflation.\nOur reporting and functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Most of the royalty payments from our agreements with our development and/or commercialization partners are payable in U.S. dollars, and we expect our revenues from future licensing agreements to be denominated mainly in U.S. dollars or in Euros. We pay a substantial portion of our expenses in U.S. dollars; however, a portion of our expenses, related to salaries of the employees in Israel and payment to part of the service providers in Israel and other territories, are paid in New Israeli Shekels, or NIS, and in other currencies. In addition, a portion of our financial assets is held in NIS and in other currencies. As a result, we are exposed to the currency fluctuation risks. For example, if the NIS strengthens against the U.S. dollar, our reported expenses in U.S. dollars may be higher than anticipated. In addition, if the NIS weakens against the U.S. dollar, the U.S. dollar value of our financial assets held in NIS will decline.\nIt may be difficult for investors in the U.S. to enforce any judgments obtained against us or any of our directors or officers.\nAlmost all of our assets are located outside the U.S., although we do maintain a permanent place of business within the U.S. In addition, all of our officers and some of our directors are nationals and/or residents of countries other than the U.S., and all or a substantial portion of such persons\u2019 assets are located outside the U.S. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the U.S. any judgments obtained against us or any of our non-U.S. directors or officers, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the U.S. or any state thereof. Additionally, it may be difficult to assert U.S. securities law claims in actions originally instituted outside of the U.S. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a U.S. securities law claim because Israeli courts may not be the most appropriate forums in which to bring such a claim. Even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that the Israeli law, and not U.S. law, is applicable to the claim. Further, if U.S. law is found to be applicable, certain content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process, and certain matters of procedure would still be governed by the Israeli law. Consequently, you may be effectively prevented from pursuing remedies under U.S. federal and state securities laws against us or any of our non-U.S. directors or officers.", "PERMNO": 17041, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "NAOV"}
