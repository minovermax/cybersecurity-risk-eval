The integration process may be complex, costly, and time-consuming. The difficulties of integrating the operations of Prism\u2019s business could include, among others:\n\u25cf\nfailure to implement IPC\u2019s business plan for the combined business, including plans for maximizing IPC\u2019s intellectual property portfolio;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated issues in integrating the business of both companies, including the operations, technology and personnel;\n\u25cf\nloss of key employees with knowledge of IPC\u2019s or Prism\u2019s historical business and operations;\n\u25cf\nissues with maintaining controls, procedures and policies during the transition and integration process;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; and\n\u25cf\nother unanticipated issues, expenses, or liabilities that could impact, among other things, IPC\u2019s ability to realize any expected benefits on a timely basis, or at all.\nIf IPC and Prism are not able to integrate their operations successfully and timely, the expected benefits of the Merger may not be realized.\nThe future financial results of Prism\u2019s business may be materially different from the forecasts that were prepared in connection with the Merger. The forecasts prepared in connection with the merger were unaudited and were not prepared in accordance with GAAP principles. In addition, such forecasts were created using assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate due to the inherently unpredictable nature of the patent licensing model. If the actual results differ from the historical results of Prism and/or IPC, or if the assumptions used in preparing such forecasts prove to be inaccurate, IPC\u2019s revenues, expenses and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, as a result of the Merger, Prism became a wholly owned subsidiary of IPC and Prism\u2019s liabilities, including contingent liabilities, will be consolidated with IPC\u2019s. There may be unforeseen or unexpected liabilities related to the Merger or Prism. Among other things, if Prism\u2019s liabilities are greater than expected, or if there are obligations of Prism of which IPC was not aware at the time of completion of the Merger, IPC\u2019s business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf IPC fails to successfully integrate Prism into its internal control over financial reporting or if the current internal control of Prism over financial reporting is found to be ineffective, the integrity of IPC\u2019s and/or Prism\u2019s financial reporting could be compromised which could result in a material adverse effect on IPC\u2019s reported financial results.\nAs a private company, Prism was not subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to internal control over financial reporting, and for a period of time after the consummation of the Merger, IPC management\u2019s evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting will be permitted to exclude the operations of Prism. The integration of Prism into IPC\u2019s internal control over financial reporting will require significant time and resources from IPC\u2019s management and other personnel and will increase IPC\u2019s compliance costs. If IPC fails to successfully integrate these operations, its internal control over financial reporting may not be effective. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on IPC\u2019s ability to accurately report its financial results and the market\u2019s perception of IPC\u2019s business and its stock price. In addition, if Prism\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is found to be ineffective, the integrity of Prism\u2019s past financial statements could be adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to IPC\u2019s Patent Licensing Business\nIPC\u2019s revenues are unpredictable.\nIPC received no revenues in 2014 or 2013. Although Prism received revenues in 2014 and 2013, IPC expects that future revenues from the patent licensing business, if any, will be unpredictable because of the significant uncertainty associated with patent licensing and patent enforcement litigation. Historical financial and operating information, therefore, is of limited value in evaluating the future prospects of IPC. IPC will continue to incur salary, legal and other expenses of operating its business and its results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected if we fail to effectively manage our overhead costs associated with patent licensing and enforcing patented technologies, become involved in expensive litigation or settlement proceedings which may or may not have successful outcomes, or the patent licensing business does not perform to IPC\u2019s expectations.\nIf the validity of any of its patents is challenged, IPC\u2019s business may be harmed.\nThe success of the patent licensing business will depend on IPC\u2019s ability to generate royalty fees from licensing technology. It is possible, however that one or more of IPC\u2019s patents might be declared invalid if challenged by an entity against whom it seeks to enforce patent rights. These challenges to the validity of IPC\u2019s patents may be made by defendants in the course of litigation or by requesting a re-examination before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the \u201cUSPTO\u201d). For example, four patents owned by IPC or its subsidiaries are currently the subject of reexamination proceedings before the USPTO. A final determination of invalidity of any patent would mean that IPC would be unable to pursue and generate further licensing revenues for that patent. Even if IPC\u2019s patents are upheld as valid, it may incur significant legal and expert fees and costs in the litigation and/or re-examination process, which may take several years to conclude and delay its ability to generate revenues. In addition, proceedings before the USPTO challenging the validity of previously issued patents are becoming more common and defendants may also use the pendency of any such action to delay or otherwise impair any pending litigation to enforce IPC's patents. IPC\u2019s existing or potential customers may await the final outcome of any proceedings before agreeing to new licenses or to paying royalties.\nEven if IPC\u2019s patents are determined to be valid, third parties may choose to alter their business operations rather than pay IPC an on-going royalty.\nIPC believes that its patents represent unique technologies that a wide range of third parties have or will find valuable to their operations. Nevertheless, IPC expects that it will need to utilize litigation to recover damages for past infringement of its patent rights and to incentivize the defendant to accept a license and pay IPC royalties for future use of the technology. Defendants may, however, choose to modify their operations to work around the claims covered by IPC\u2019s patents. In that case, such defendants would not pay IPC royalties for future use and IPC\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects may be harmed.\nIPC and its licensees serve markets that frequently undergo transitions in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry-wide basis. As a result, IPC\u2019s ability to prevent such work arounds by a defendant and to remain competitive in the future will depend on its ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards.\nThe success of IPC depends in part upon its ability to retain qualified legal counsel to represent it in licensing efforts and patent enforcement litigation.\nThe success of the patent licensing business depends upon its ability to retain qualified legal counsel to represent IPC in patent enforcement matters. As such patent enforcement actions increase, it may become more difficult to find qualified legal counsel to handle all of IPC\u2019s cases because larger law firms may have a conflict of interest that prevents their representation of IPC and smaller law firms may not have the resources to handle multiple lawsuits. In addition, contingency fee arrangements, although common in patent enforcement litigation, require the law firm to be willing to devote substantial time to the case based on an expectation of a successful outcome.\nIPC is dependent on certain key personnel, and the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on IPC\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of the Patent Licensing Business largely depends on the skills, experience and efforts of key personnel. IPC has entered into three-year employment agreements and non-competition agreements with key Prism employees, but these agreements cannot guarantee their continued employment with IPC. For a variety of reasons, a key employee could terminate his employment with IPC, which would jeopardize IPC\u2019s ability to execute its strategic plan and materially harm its business.\nIPC may be unable to obtain additional capital to fund its operations and finance its growth on acceptable terms or at all, which could cause IPC to delay or abandon its development and expansion plans.\nIPC may need significant additional capital to implement or expand its business plan or to exercise its legal rights in significant patent infringement cases. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available to IPC when needed or at all. If IPC is unable to obtain capital when needed, it may be forced to delay or abandon its enforcement, operational or expansion plans. Any such delays or abandonment could have a material adverse effect on IPC\u2019s business and financial condition.\nAs patent enforcement litigation becomes more prevalent, it may become more difficult for IPC to voluntarily license its patents to other entities.\nIPC believes that the more prevalent patent enforcement actions become, the more difficult it will be for IPC to license its patents to other entities on a voluntary basis. As a result, IPC may need to increase the number of its patent enforcement actions to cause infringing companies to license its patents or pay damages for past infringement. This may result in increased expenses, delay the recovery of damages and harm IPC\u2019s business.\nTrial judges and juries often find it difficult to understand complex patent enforcement litigation, and as a result, IPC may need to appeal adverse decisions by lower courts in order to successfully enforce its patents.\nIt is difficult to predict the outcome of patent enforcement litigation at the trial level. It is often difficult for juries and trial judges to understand complex, patented technologies, and as a result, there is a higher rate of successful appeals in patent enforcement litigation than other business litigation. Such appeals are expensive and time consuming and result in increased costs and delayed revenue. Although IPC may diligently pursue enforcement litigation, it cannot predict with significant reliability the decisions made by juries and trial courts.\nThe acquisition of patent portfolios by IPC may not be successful.\nA substantial portion of the patent assets of Prism and its subsidiaries were acquired from third parties. IPC expects to continue to build its patent portfolio by acquisitions from third parties. Any acquisition may require IPC to pay cash upfront, share a portion of future licensing proceeds, or both. Such acquisitions are subject to numerous risks, including the following:\n\u25cf\nIPC\u2019s inability to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to any potential acquisition, or if IPC is able to enter into such agreement, its inability to consummate the potential acquisition;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty integrating the operations, technology and personnel of the acquired entity;\n\u25cf\nour inability to achieve the anticipated financial and other benefits of the specific acquisition;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of IPC management\u2019s attention from other business concerns; and\n\u25cf\nfailure of IPC\u2019s due diligence process to identify significant issues, including issues with respect to patented technologies and patent portfolios, and other legal and financial contingencies.\nAnalyzing the validity and enforceability of patents is a complex and uncertain process and there can be no assurance that a patent that is acquired will produce positive returns on the investment.\nIPC may, in certain circumstances, rely on representations, warranties and opinions made by third-parties that, if determined to be false or inaccurate, may expose it to certain material liabilities.\nIPC may rely upon representations and warranties made by third-parties from whom it acquired patents or the exclusive rights to license and enforce patents. IPC may also rely upon the opinions of purported experts. In certain instances, IPC may not have the opportunity to independently investigate and verify the facts upon which such representations, warranties, and opinions are made. By relying on these representations, warranties and opinions, IPC may be exposed to liabilities in connection with the licensing and enforcement of certain patents and patent rights which could have a material adverse effect on IPC\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nPatent enforcement is time-consuming and requires significant management and financial resources.\nIPC believes that licensing and enforcement activities could continue for years and consume significant financial and management resources. The counterparties to IPC\u2019s licensing and enforcement activities may be large, well-financed companies with substantially greater resources than IPC. IPC cannot assure you that any of IPC\u2019s licensing and enforcement efforts will result in a favorable outcome. In addition, even if IPC obtains favorable interim rulings or verdicts in particular litigation matters, such rulings may not be predictive of the ultimate resolution of the dispute. Also, IPC cannot assure you that IPC will not be exposed to claims or sanctions which may be costly or impossible to defend. Unfavorable or adverse outcomes may result in losses, exhaustion of financial resources or other adverse effects which could adversely impact IPC\u2019s ability to generate revenues from its patent licensing and enforcement business.\nFederal courts are becoming more crowded, and as a result, patent enforcement litigation is taking longer.\nIf IPC is required to litigate to enforce its patented technologies, its patent enforcement actions will be almost exclusively prosecuted in federal court. Federal trial courts that hear patent enforcement actions also hear criminal cases, which will take priority over IPC\u2019s patent enforcement actions. As a result, it is difficult to predict the length of time it will take to complete an enforcement action. Moreover, IPC believes there is a trend in increasing numbers of civil lawsuits and criminal proceedings before federal judges, and as a result, IPC believes that the risk of delays in patent enforcement actions may have an adverse effect on IPC\u2019s business in the future unless this trend changes.\nIPC is expected to depend upon relationships with others to provide technology-based opportunities that can develop into profitable royalty-bearing licenses, and if it is unable to maintain and generate new relationships, then IPC may not be able to sustain existing levels of revenue or increase revenue.\nIPC may apply for patents on technologies it develops, but it is expected to depend increasingly upon the identification and acquisition of new patents and inventions through relationships with inventors, universities, research institutions, technology companies and others. If IPC is unable to demonstrate success in licensing acquired patents, it will be difficult to maintain those relationships, continue to grow new relationships and sustain revenue and growth.\nCompetition for the acquisition of high quality patent assets is intense and, as a result, IPC may not be able to grow its portfolio of technologies and patents.\nIPC is expected to encounter competition in the area of patent acquisition and enforcement as the number of companies entering this market is increasing. This includes competitors seeking to acquire the same or similar patents and technologies that IPC may seek to acquire. As new technological advances occur, many of IPC\u2019s patented technologies may become obsolete before they are completely monetized. If IPC is unable to replace obsolete technologies with more technologically advanced patented technologies, then this obsolescence could have a negative effect on IPC\u2019s ability to generate future revenues.\nIPC may also compete with venture capital firms and various industry leaders for patent licensing opportunities. Many of these competitors may have more financial and human resources than IPC. IPC\u2019s market share in one or more technology industries may be reduced as more companies enter the market for similar technology opportunities, which could adversely impact IPC\u2019s future revenue generation.\nAdverse changes in general economic conditions could adversely affect IPC\u2019s operating results\nThe severe economic downturn in the United States in 2007- 2008 resulted in a record level of corporate insolvencies. IPC is unable to estimate the probability that companies that IPC asserts its patents against will have sufficient resources to fully compensate it for their past infringement or future use of IPC\u2019s patented technologies. The inability to recover full value from a significant number of entities would harm IPC\u2019s future revenues. In addition, uncertainty about future patent licensing and litigation recoveries will make it more difficult to accurately assess the potential impairment of patent-related intangible assets.\nIn connection with patent enforcement actions to be conducted by IPC, a court may rule that it has violated certain statutory, regulatory, federal, local or governing rules or standards, which may expose it to certain material liabilities.\nIn connection with any patent enforcement actions to be conducted by IPC, it is possible that a defendant may claim and/or a court may rule that IPC has violated statutory authority, regulatory authority, federal rules, local court rules, or governing standards relating to the substantive or procedural aspects of such enforcement actions. In such event, a court may issue monetary sanctions against IPC or award attorney\u2019s fees and/or expenses to a defendant, which could be material, and if IPC is required to pay such monetary sanctions, attorneys\u2019 fees and/or expenses, such payment could materially harm its operating results and financial position.\nIPC\u2019s use of its net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as a result of an ownership change or otherwise.\nFederal and state tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in the event of an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (as amended and together with any applicable regulations promulgated thereunder, the \u201cCode\u201d), and in certain other circumstances. Although IPC\u2019s stockholder rights plan (discussed above) is designed to protect against the occurrence of an ownership change under Code Section 382, there is no assurance that such an ownership change could not occur or that the utilization of IPC\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards could not be otherwise restricted by legislative, judicial or regulatory developments.\nRisks Related to the Industry\nChanges in patent law could adversely impact IPC\u2019s business.\nPatent laws may continue to change, and may alter the historically consistent protections afforded to owners of patent rights. Such changes may not be favorable for IPC and may make it more difficult for IPC to obtain adequate patent protection to enforce its patents against infringing parties. Increased focus on the growing number of patent-related lawsuits may result in legislative changes which increase IPC\u2019s costs and related risks of asserting patent enforcement actions. For instance, in 2013, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill that would require non-practicing entities that bring patent infringement lawsuits to pay legal costs of the defendants, if the lawsuits are unsuccessful and certain standards are not met. The United States Senate did not pass that bill and it therefore was not enacted into law. In February 2015, a similar bill was introduced in the United States House of Representatives that would require losing parties in patent suits to pay the prevailing party\u2019s legal fees, raise pleading standards for patent suits and put limits on discovery. If passed, such bill could significantly increase the cost and risk of patent enforcement litigation. There can be no assurance that this bill, or similar future legislative developments, will not have a material adverse effect on IPC\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIPC\u2019s patented technologies face uncertain market value.\nIPC holds or may acquire patents and technologies that are in the early stages of adoption in the commercial and consumer markets. Demand for some of these technologies is untested and is subject to fluctuation based upon the rate at which IPC\u2019s licensees will adopt such patents and technologies in their products and services.\nDelays in getting patents issued by the USPTO could result in delays in recognizing revenues.\nIPC will continue to pursue several patent applications currently pending before the USPTO and it intends to continue to apply for additional patents. In addition, IPC is expected to acquire patent applications from third parties. Patent applications have been increasing each year and IPC believes it is resulting in longer delays in obtaining approval of pending patent applications. The application delays could cause delays in recognizing revenue from these patents and could cause IPC to miss opportunities to license patents before other competing technologies are developed or introduced into the market.\nAny reductions in the funding of the USPTO could have an adverse impact on the cost of processing pending patent applications and the value of those pending patent applications.\nThe assets of IPC will consist of patent portfolios, including pending patent applications before the USPTO. The value of IPC\u2019s patent portfolios will be dependent upon the issuance of patents in a timely manner, and any reductions in the funding of the USPTO could negatively impact the value of these assets. Further, reductions in funding from Congress could result in higher patent application filing and maintenance fees charged by the USPTO, causing an unexpected increase in IPC\u2019s expenses.\nRisks Related to IPC\u2019s Common Stock\nIPC\u2019s future stock price may fluctuate widely.\nThe trading price of IPC\u2019s common stock has been volatile and may be significantly affected by factors including actual or anticipated operating results, announcements regarding licensing or litigation developments, disputes concerning the validity of one or more of IPC\u2019s patents, IPC\u2019s limited trading volume and expectations regarding future cash dividends or distributions. These fluctuations may harm IPC\u2019s stock price. Any negative change in the public\u2019s perception of the prospects of the patent licensing business could also depress IPC\u2019s stock price regardless of its results.\nIPC\u2019s common stock may be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market if it fails to satisfy the continued listing standards of that market.\nIf IPC is unable to satisfy the continued listing standards of The NASDAQ Capital Market, its common stock may be delisted from that market. In order to continue to be listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, IPC must meet all of the following requirements as set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a):\n\u25cf\nminimum bid price of at least $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days;\n\u25cf\nat least 300 total stockholders (including both beneficial holders and holders of record, but excluding any holder who is directly or indirectly an executive officer, director, or the beneficial holder of more than 10% of the total shares outstanding);\n\u25cf\nat least 500,000 publicly held shares with a market value of at least $1 million (excluding any shares held directly or indirectly by officers, directors or any person who is the beneficial owner of more than 10% of the total shares outstanding of the Company); and\n\u25cf\nat least two registered and active market makers, one of which may be a market maker entering a stabilizing bid.\nIPC must also meet at least one of the three standards in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b) as follows:\n\u25cf\nstockholders\u2019 equity of at least $2.5 million;\n\u25cf\nmarket value of listed securities of at least $35 million; or\n\u25cf\nnet income from continuing operations of $500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or in two of the three most recently completed fiscal years.\nIf IPC does not satisfy those standards and is unsuccessful in taking corrective action to comply with the listing requirements, it may be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market. If IPC\u2019s common stock were to be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market, trading of IPC common stock most likely would be conducted in the over-the-counter market on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. Such trading could substantially reduce the market liquidity of IPC common stock. As a result, an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of IPC common stock.\nIPC\u2019s adoption of a shareholder rights plan may reduce the attractiveness of its stock to investors because it limits the ability of persons or entities from acquiring a significant percentage of IPC\u2019s outstanding stock.\nOn November 30, 2012, IPC stockholders approved an amendment to the IPC\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation creating a stockholder rights plan designed to preserve the value of certain tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards under Section 382 of the Code. Stockholders also approved a Section 382 Rights Agreement adopted by IPC\u2019s board of directors in November 2011. The stockholder rights plan and rights agreement are intended to act as deterrents to any person or group, together with its affiliates and associates, being or becoming the beneficial owner of 4.9% or more of the IPC\u2019s common stock. The inability of some stockholders to acquire a significant position could substantially reduce the market liquidity of IPC\u2019s common stock, making it more difficult for a stockholder to dispose of, or obtain accurate quotations for the price of, IPC common stock.\nDelaware law and IPC\u2019s charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to IPC stockholders.\nProvisions of Delaware law and IPC\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws could make it more difficult for an entity to acquire IPC by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest, or otherwise, or to remove incumbent directors and officers.", "PERMNO": 87074, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "PRZM"}
