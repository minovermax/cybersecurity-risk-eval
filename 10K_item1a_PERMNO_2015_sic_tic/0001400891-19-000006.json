RISK FACTORS\nChapter 11 Reorganization Risks\nWe filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 on March 14, 2018 and even though our Plan of Reorganization was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on January 22, 2019, we are still subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases.\nWe are currently operating as debtors-in-possession under Chapter 11 and our continuation as a going concern is contingent upon, among other things, our ability to consummate the Plan of Reorganization. Even though our Plan of Reorganization was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on January 22, 2019, it is subject to certain conditions to its effectiveness, including the receipt of certain governmental approvals. So long as our Chapter 11 Cases continue, our operations, including our ability to execute our business plan, are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy.\nRisks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 Cases include the following:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to consummate the Plan of Reorganization or may be delayed in doing so;\n\u2022\nthird parties may take actions or make decisions that are inconsistent with and detrimental to the plans we believe to be in the best interests of the Company;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to obtain court approval with respect to certain matters in the Chapter 11 Cases from time to time;\n\u2022\nthe Bankruptcy Court may not agree with our objections to positions taken by other parties;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain and maintain normal credit terms with vendors, strategic partners and service providers;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to continue to invest in our products and services, which could hurt our competitiveness;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to enter into or maintain contracts that are critical to our operations at competitive rates and terms, if at all; and\n\u2022\nour customers may choose to advertise with our competitors.\nThese risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways. For example, negative events or publicity associated with our Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect our ability to compete for advertising dollars and our relationship with our customers, as well as with our business partners, vendors and employees, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition, particularly if the Chapter 11 Cases are protracted. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 Cases, the ultimate impact that the events that occur during these proceedings will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted or quantified. If any one or more of these risks materializes, it could affect our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAlthough the Plan of Reorganization has been confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court it is subject to certain conditions for its effectiveness.\nThe consummation of the Plan of Reorganization is subject to certain conditions, including the receipt of certain governmental approvals. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy these conditions. If we are unable to consummate the\nPlan of Reorganization, it is unclear whether we will be able to reorganize our business and what, if any, distributions holders of the remaining claims against or equity interests in the Company ultimately would receive with respect to their claims or equity interests. An alternative plan of reorganization could contemplate the Company continuing as a going concern, the Company or its assets being acquired by a third party, the Company being merged with a competitor, or some other proposal. We may not believe that such an alternative plan of reorganization is in our stakeholders\u2019 best interests or fully values the benefits to be achieved by our reorganization. An alternative plan of reorganization could potentially delay our emergence from Chapter 11 and expose us to a number of other risks, including potential limitations on our ability to execute our business plan and strategic initiatives; difficulties in hiring, retaining and motivating key personnel; negative reactions among our employees, vendors, strategic partners and service providers; and unease and uncertainty among our advertising customer base.\nOur future results are dependent upon the timely and successful implementation of the Plan of Reorganization. If a restructuring is protracted, it could adversely affect our operating results, including our relationships with our advertising customers, business partners and employees. The longer it takes to implement the Plan of Reorganization, the more likely it is that our advertising customers will lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our businesses successfully and seek to establish alternative commercial relationships. If we experience a protracted reorganization, there is a significant risk that the value of our enterprise would be substantially eroded to the detriment of all stakeholders.\nOperating under Chapter 11 may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nUnder Chapter 11, transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit our ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. We must obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to, among other things:\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with our vendors;\n\u2022\nbuy or sell assets outside the ordinary course of business;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\ngrant liens; and\n\u2022\nfinance our operations, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases have required and will continue to require a substantial amount of time and attention of our senior management, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases have required and will continue to require a substantial portion of time and attention from our senior management team and will continue to leave them with less time to devote to the operations of our business. Our management has spent considerable time participating in the development of restructuring plans, the business plan for the Company, the Plan of Reorganization and related emergence activities. This diversion of management\u2019s attention may have a material adverse effect on the conduct of our business, and, as a result, on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases is protracted.\nWe may experience increased levels of employee attrition as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we may experience increased levels of employee attrition, and our employees likely will face considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incent key employees to remain with us through the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is limited by restrictions on implementation of incentive programs under the Bankruptcy Code. The loss of services of members of our senior management team could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, which would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur ability to emerge from Chapter 11 and operate profitably thereafter will depend on our ability to secure exit financing or other capital.\nAlthough the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming our Plan of Reorganization on January 22, 2019, the Plan of Reorganization is subject to certain conditions to its effectiveness. Among other things, for our Plan of Reorganization to be effective, we will need to obtain exit financing or capital to fund our emergence costs and support our business following emergence. Even though we currently have access to a $450.0 million debtors-in-possession credit facility (the \u201cDIP Facility\u201d), which includes a feature to convert into an exit facility at emergence from Chapter 11 on substantially the terms set forth in an exhibit to the DIP Facility credit agreement, there is no certainty that we will be able to meet the conditions required for such conversion or obtain a waiver from the lenders or that the final terms of this facility will be as set forth in the exhibit thereto. If we are unable to convert the DIP Facility into an exit facility, or if we otherwise choose not to do so, the Plan of Reorganization allows us to obtain alternative\nexit financing. We cannot presently determine the terms of such financing, nor can there be any assurances of our success in obtaining it. Failure to obtain exit financing or other capital may delay our emergence from Chapter 11 and/or limit our alternatives, which could result in our inability to continue as a going concern. Even if such financing or other capital is available, there is no guarantee that we will be able to implement our business plan and achieve improved financial results.\nOur current cost structure is heavily driven by existing levels of indebtedness. Our Plan of Reorganization contemplates reducing iHeartCommunications\u2019 debt from approximately $16 billion to $5.75 billion. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully meet our debt service costs or our planned continuing obligations following emergence from Chapter 11. Failure to pay our debt service obligations or to obtain cost savings upon emergence could materially hamper our ability to operate profitably after emergence, and could result in our inability to continue as a going concern.\nThird parties may propose competing Chapter 11 plans of reorganization and we may receive unsolicited offers for the Company or our assets.\nChapter 11 gave us the exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization during the first 120 days after filing. That period has been extended with approval of the Bankruptcy Court and may be further extended for up to 18 months from the petition date with approval of the Bankruptcy Court. While we intend to conclude our Chapter 11 Cases during this so-called \u201cexclusivity period,\u201d there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. Although the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming our Plan of Reorganization on January 22, 2019, the Plan of Reorganization is subject to certain conditions to its effectiveness, and there is no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied or otherwise waived. After the expiration of the exclusivity period, third parties can file one or more Chapter 11 plans of reorganization for the Debtors. An alternative plan of reorganization could contemplate the Company continuing as a going concern, the Company being broken up, the Company or its assets being acquired by a third party, the Company being merged with a competitor, or some other proposal. We may not believe that such an alternative plan of reorganization is in our stakeholders\u2019 best interests or fully values the benefits to be achieved by our reorganization. If our confirmed Plan of Reorganization does not become effective, and if we cannot successfully obtain approval of an alternative plan of reorganization during the exclusivity period that we propose, we may have limited ability to prevent an alternative plan of reorganization proposed by other parties in interest from being approved by the Bankruptcy Court.\nCompanies in Chapter 11 are often the target of unsolicited merger and acquisition offers, and if we are not able to consummate the confirmed Plan of Reorganization, there is no guarantee that we will emerge from Chapter 11 as a standalone company. An unsolicited proposal or alternative plan of reorganization could potentially delay our emergence from Chapter 11 and expose us to a number of other risks, including potential limitations on our ability to execute our business plan and strategic initiatives; difficulties in hiring, retaining and motivating key personnel; negative reactions among our employees, vendors, strategic partners and service providers; a failure to provide stakeholders full value for the benefits that could be achieved by the Company post-emergence on a stand-alone basis; and unease and uncertainty among our advertising customer base.\nEven if the Plan of Reorganization is consummated, we will continue to face risks.\nEven if the Plan of Reorganization or an alternative plan of reorganization is consummated, we will continue to face a number of risks, including certain risks that are beyond our control, such as further deterioration or other changes in economic conditions, changes in our industry and potential revaluing of our assets due to the Chapter 11 Cases. Some of these concerns and effects typically become more acute when a case under the Bankruptcy Code continues for a protracted period without indication of how or when the case may be completed. As a result of these risks and others, there is no guarantee that any plan of reorganization will achieve our stated goals.\nFurthermore, we may need to raise funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our business after the completion of the Chapter 11 process. Adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms. Even once the Plan of Reorganization is implemented, our operating results may be adversely affected by the possible reluctance of advertisers to do business with a company that recently emerged from bankruptcy proceedings.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, our historical financial information may be volatile and not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nWe expect our financial results to continue to be volatile until we are able to emerge from Chapter 11, as asset impairments, asset dispositions, restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance may not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nOur capital structure will be significantly altered under the Plan of Reorganization. Under fresh-start accounting rules that may apply to us upon the effective date of the plan, our assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair value, which could have\na significant impact on our financial statements. Accordingly, if fresh-start accounting rules apply, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and the development of the Plan of Reorganization, it is also possible that additional restructuring and related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such charges could be material to our consolidated financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to the filing of our Chapter 11 Cases (i) are subject to compromise and/or treatment under the Plan of Reorganization or (ii) will be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the Plan of Reorganization. However, there can be no assurance that the aggregate amount of such claims that are not subject to treatment under the Plan of Reorganization or that are not discharged will not be material.\nLiquidity Risk\nOur cash flows may not provide sufficient liquidity during or after the Chapter 11 Cases.\nOur ability to fund our operations and our capital expenditures require a significant amount of cash. Our principal sources of liquidity historically have been cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under the senior secured credit facilities and the receivables-based credit facility and issuances of bonds. If our cash flow from operations decreases as a result of lower advertising prices, decreased listener demand, or otherwise, we may not have the ability to expend the capital necessary to improve or maintain our current operations, resulting in decreased revenues over time.\nWe face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources and have extremely limited, if any, access to additional financing. In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with preparation for the Chapter 11 Cases and expect that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs throughout our Chapter 11 Cases. We cannot assure you that cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to continue to fund our operations and allow us to satisfy our obligations related to the Chapter 11 Cases until we are able to emerge from our Chapter 11 Cases.\nOur liquidity, including our ability to meet our ongoing operational obligations, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of the cash collateral order and the order approving our post-petition debtor-in-possession financing entered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, (ii) our ability to maintain adequate cash on hand, (iii) our ability to generate cash flow from operations, (iv) our ability to consummate the Plan of Reorganization or other alternative plan of reorganization or restructuring transaction, and (v) the cost, duration and outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nWe may not have sufficient cash to fund our operations and our emergence costs.\nAs discussed above under \u201cChapter 11 Reorganization Risks,\u201d our cash flows from operations may not provide sufficient liquidity during the Chapter 11 Cases and exit financing or capital may not be sufficient to support our operations post-emergence. Our operating cash flows and exit financing or capital may not be sufficient to pay our debt as it comes due, interest on our debt, emergence costs and other operating expenses. We currently face significantly higher operating expenses due in part to payments to our financial and legal advisors, as well as fees and other amounts payable to the advisors to our lenders and bondholders in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases. Because we have limited short-term sources of cash, we may be unable to successfully emerge from bankruptcy or implement our Plan of Reorganization.\nOur ability to maintain adequate liquidity through the reorganization process and beyond depends on successful operation of our business, and appropriate management of operating expenses and capital spending. Our anticipated liquidity needs are highly sensitive to changes in each of these and other factors.\nThe consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. We have significant indebtedness, all of which we have reclassified to current liabilities at December 31, 2017 and 2018, and we expect to have significant indebtedness upon emergence. Our level of indebtedness has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our financial conditions after emergence from Chapter 11. As a result of our financial condition, the defaults under our debt agreements, and the risks and uncertainties surrounding our emergence from Chapter 11 Cases, substantial doubt exists that we will be able to continue as a going concern.\nOur substantial indebtedness upon emergence from Chapter 11 may adversely affect our financial health and operating flexibility.\nPursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, at emergence, we expect to have a $450.0 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility, $4,300.0 million in principal amount of secured debt and $1,450.0 million principal amount of unsecured debt. This substantial amount of indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service debt;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates, particularly given our substantial indebtedness which bears interest at variable rates;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability or increasing the costs to refinance indebtedness.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases may give rise to unfavorable tax consequences for us.\nThe consummation of the Chapter 11 Cases may have an adverse tax impact on us. The Separation is intended to be a taxable transaction. The gain or loss recognized with respect to these transactions will depend on, among other things, (a) the value and tax basis of the assets of the radio businesses of the Company that will be transferred by our subsidiary Clear Channel Holdings, Inc. (\u201cCCH\u201d) to a new subsidiary of the Company formed for the purpose of holding such assets and the value and tax basis of the new common stock of CCOH to be issued on the effective date of the Plan of Reorganization (such values will be determined by reference to, among other things, the trading value of the Company\u2019s equity and the new common stock of CCOH following the effective date); (b) complex modeling considerations under certain U.S. Department of Treasury regulations; (c) the amount of cancellation of indebtedness income realized in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases; and (d) the extent to which any \u201cexcess loss accounts\u201d (as defined under applicable Treasury regulations) are taken into account. The extent to which any related taxable gain or loss will result in any cash tax liabilities will depend on whether our tax attributes, including our net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) (including those of CCOH and its subsidiaries), are sufficient to offset any net taxable gain attributable to the transactions.\nBecause certain of the factors that will determine whether the separation will give rise to any cash tax liability cannot be known until the effective date, we cannot say with certainty whether any such cash tax liability will be owed. To the extent the transactions do give rise to any cash tax liability, CCOH, iHeartCommunications, the Company and various other entities would be jointly and severally liable under applicable law for any such amounts. The allocation of any such liabilities among the Company and its subsidiaries post-consummation of the Plan of Reorganization and CCOH will be addressed by a new tax matters agreement that will be entered into in connection with the Separation.\nTransfers of our equity and issuances of equity in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases may impair our ability to utilize our federal income tax NOL carryforwards in future years.\nUnder federal income tax law, a corporation is generally permitted to deduct from taxable income net operating losses carried forward from prior years. Our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income and to reduce federal income tax liability is subject to certain requirements and restrictions. If we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, then our ability to use our NOL carryforwards may be substantially limited, which could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. Generally, there is an \u201cownership change\u201d if one or more shareholders owning 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s common stock have aggregate increases in their ownership of such stock of more than 50 percentage points over the prior three-year period. Following the implementation of a plan of reorganization in the Chapter 11 Cases, it is expected that we will experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d Under section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, absent an application exception, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the amount of its net operating losses that may be utilized to offset future taxable income generally is subject to an annual limitation on the amount of federal income tax net operating loss carry-forwards existing prior to the change that it could utilize to offset its taxable income in any future taxable year to an amount generally equal to the value of its stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate, subject to adjustments to reflect the differences between the fair market value of the corporation\u2019s assets and the tax basis in such assets. Because the value of our stock can fluctuate materially, it is possible an ownership change would materially limit our ability to utilize our substantial federal income tax NOL carryforwards in the future. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to utilize our federal income tax NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income, even if any such attributes survive reduction as a result of cancellation of indebtedness income.\nCCOH\u2019s substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on CCOH\u2019s performance and on our financial condition and liquidity.\nOur subsidiary CCOH has a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2018, CCOH had $5.3 billion of total indebtedness outstanding, including: (1) $2,721 million aggregate principal amount of Clear Channel Worldwide Holdings, Inc.\u2019s, a subsidiary of CCOH, (\u201cCCWH\u201d) senior notes, net of unamortized discounts of $3.4 million, which mature in November 2022; (2) $2,200 million aggregate principal amount of CCWH\u2019s senior subordinated notes, which were scheduled to mature in March 2020 prior to their redemption in 2019; (3) $377.7 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of international subsidiary senior notes, net of unamortized premiums of $2.7 million, which mature in December 2020; and (4) $3.9 million of other debt. On February 12, 2019, CCWH refinanced its senior subordinated notes, which were scheduled to mature in March 2020, with an aggregate principal amount of $2,235 million of new senior subordinated notes, which mature in February 2024. CCOH\u2019s ability to make scheduled payments on its debt obligations depends on its financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond its control. CCOH may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit it to pay the principal and interest on its indebtedness. CCOH\u2019s operations and its ability to successfully refinance or extend its debt may also be negatively affected by our Chapter 11 Cases.\niHeartCommunications, which is a Debtor in the Chapter 11 Cases, provides the day-to-day cash management services for CCOH\u2019s cash activities and balances in the U.S. pursuant to the Corporate Services Agreement between iHeartCommunications and CCOH, and is continuing to do so during the Chapter 11 Cases pursuant to a cash management order approved by the Bankruptcy Court. As of December 31, 2018, there was a balance of $21.6 million due by CCOH in this account, which the Debtors have agreed to waive upon emergence pursuant to the settlement entered into on December 16, 2018, by and among the Debtors, CCOH and certain other parties in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases (the \u201cCCOH Separation Settlement\u201d) as described under Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings--Stockholder Litigation.\u201d CCOH currently does not have any material committed external sources of capital other than iHeartCommunications. If CCOH has a significant need for capital prior to emergence, and iHeartCommunications is limited in its ability to provide such capital, there could be a material adverse effect on CCOH\u2019s financial condition and liquidity. In addition, pursuant to the CCOH Separation Settlement, iHeartCommunications has agreed to provide an unsecured revolving line of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed $200 million to CCOH for a period of no more than three years following the effective date of the Plan of Reorganization. If CCOH is unable to pay any borrowings due thereunder, our financial condition and liquidity could suffer.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nTrading in our securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks.\nTrading prices for our common stock are very volatile and may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery by the holders of such securities in the Chapter 11 Cases. Although the terms of the Plan of Reorganization contemplate that our existing equity holders will collectively receive 1% of the equity in reorganized iHeartMedia upon completion of the Chapter 11 Cases, if the Plan of Reorganization does not become effective, it is possible that our common stock will be canceled and extinguished upon the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and the holders thereof would not be entitled to receive, and would not receive or retain, any property or interest in property on account of such equity interests. In the event of a cancellation of our common stock, amounts invested by such holders in our outstanding common stock will not be recoverable. Consequently, our currently outstanding common stock would have no value. Accordingly, we urge that extreme caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in our equity securities and any of our other securities.\nRisks of trading in the Over-The-Counter Pink Market.\nShares of our Class A common stock are quoted in the Over-The-Counter Pink Market (\"Pink Market\"). The lack of an active market may impair the ability of holders of our Class A common stock to sell their shares of Class A common stock at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of the shares of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in our Class A common stock, the price of our Class A common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the markets' perception of our business, and announcements made by us, our competitors, parties with whom we have business relationships or third parties with interests in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThe equity that our current equity holders and creditors will receive pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization will be subject to dilution as a result of future issuances of our common stock.\nThe terms of the Plan of Reorganization contemplate that our existing equity holders will collectively receive 1% of the equity in reorganized iHeartMedia with creditors collectively receiving the rest. The Plan of Reorganization also contemplates\nthat an equity-based incentive compensation plan pursuant to which certain of our directors, managers, officers and employees will be granted awards, will be adopted on the effective date of the Plan of Reorganization. Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, up to 8% of the common stock of reorganized iHeartMedia on a fully diluted basis, will be reserved under the equity-based incentive compensation plan. Current equity holders and creditors receiving a recovery under the Plan of Reorganization will be subject to dilution from issuances under the equity-based incentive compensation plan.\nWe may terminate our Exchange Act reporting, if permitted by applicable law.\nIf at any time our Class A common stock is held by fewer than 300 holders of record, we will be permitted to cease to be a reporting company under the Exchange Act to the extent we are not otherwise required to continue to report pursuant to any contractual agreements, including with respect to any of our indebtedness. If we were to cease filing reports under the Exchange Act, the information now available to our stockholders in the annual, quarterly and other reports we currently file with the SEC would not be available to them as a matter of right.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur results have been in the past, and could be in the future, adversely affected by economic uncertainty or deteriorations in economic conditions.\nWe derive revenues from the sale of advertising. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Periods of a slowing economy or recession, or periods of economic uncertainty, may be accompanied by a decrease in advertising. For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 resulted in a decline in advertising and marketing by our customers, which resulted in a decline in advertising revenues across our businesses. This reduction in advertising revenues had an adverse effect on our revenue, profit margins, cash flow and liquidity. Global economic conditions have been slow to recover and remain uncertain. If economic conditions do not continue to improve, economic uncertainty increases or economic conditions deteriorate again, global economic conditions may once again adversely impact our revenue, profit margins, cash flow and liquidity. Furthermore, because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from local advertisers, our ability to generate revenues in specific markets is directly affected by local and regional conditions, and unfavorable regional economic conditions also may adversely impact our results. In addition, even in the absence of a downturn in general economic conditions, an individual business sector or market may experience a downturn, causing it to reduce its advertising expenditures, which also may adversely impact our results.\nWe face intense competition in our iHeartMedia and our outdoor advertising businesses.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current audience ratings and advertising revenues. Our iHeartMedia and our outdoor advertising businesses compete for audiences and advertising revenues with other radio and outdoor advertising businesses, as well as with other media, such as newspapers, magazines, television, direct mail, portable digital audio players, mobile devices, satellite radio, Internet-based services and live entertainment, within their respective markets. Audience ratings and market shares are subject to change for various reasons, including through consolidation of our competitors through processes such as mergers and acquisitions, which could have the effect of reducing our revenues in a specific market. Our competitors may develop technology, services or advertising media that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve. It also is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share in any of our business segments. The advertiser/agency ecosystem is diverse and dynamic, with advertiser/agency relationships subject to change. This could have an adverse effect on us if an advertiser client shifts its relationship to an agency with whom we do not have as good a relationship. An increased level of competition for advertising dollars may lead to lower advertising rates as we attempt to retain customers or may cause us to lose customers to our competitors who offer lower rates that we are unable or unwilling to match. Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to achieve a competitive cost structure during the Chapter 11 Cases. If we cannot do so, then our business, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.\nAlternative media platforms and technologies may continue to increase competition with our broadcasting operations.\nOur terrestrial radio broadcasting operations face increasing competition from alternative media platforms and technologies, such as broadband wireless, satellite radio, audio broadcasting by cable television systems and Internet-based streaming music services, as well as consumer products, such as portable digital audio players and other mobile devices, smart phones and tablets, gaming consoles, in-home entertainment and enhanced automotive platforms. These technologies and alternative media platforms, including those used by us, compete with our broadcast radio stations for audience share and advertising revenues. We are unable to predict the effect that such technologies and related services and products will have on our broadcasting operations. The capital expenditures necessary to implement these or other technologies could be substantial and we cannot assure you that we will continue to have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services to compete with other new technologies or services, or that our investments in new technologies or services will provide the desired returns. Other\ncompanies employing new technologies or services could more successfully implement such new technologies or services or otherwise increase competition with our businesses.\nOur iHeartMedia business is dependent upon the performance of on-air talent and program hosts.\nWe employ or independently contract with many on-air personalities and hosts of syndicated radio programs with significant loyal audiences in their respective markets. Although we have entered into long-term agreements with some of our key on-air talent and program hosts to protect our interests in those relationships, we can give no assurance that all or any of these persons will remain with us or will retain their audiences. Competition for these individuals is intense and many of these individuals are under no legal obligation to remain with us. Our competitors may choose to extend offers to any of these individuals on terms which we may be unwilling to meet. Furthermore, the popularity and audience loyalty of our key on-air talent and program hosts is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes. A loss of such popularity or audience loyalty is beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract local and/or national advertisers and on our revenue and/or ratings, and could result in increased expenses.\nOur business is dependent on our management team and other key individuals.\nOur business is dependent upon the performance of our management team and other key individuals. Although we have entered into agreements with some members of our management team and certain other key individuals, we can give no assurance that all or any of our management team and other key individuals will remain with us, or that we won\u2019t continue to make changes to the composition of, and the roles and responsibilities of, our management team. Competition for these individuals is intense and many of our key employees are at-will employees who are under no obligation to remain with us, and may decide to leave for a variety of personal or other reasons beyond our control. If members of our management or key individuals decide to leave us in the future, if we decide to make further changes to the composition of, or the roles and responsibilities of, these individuals, or if we are not successful in attracting, motivating and retaining other key employees, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by many factors beyond our control.\nCertain factors that could adversely affect our financial performance by, among other things, decreasing overall revenues, the numbers of advertising customers, advertising fees or profit margins include:\n\u2022\nunfavorable fluctuations in operating costs, which we may be unwilling or unable to pass through to our customers;\n\u2022\nour inability to successfully adopt or our being late in adopting technological changes and innovations that offer more attractive advertising or listening alternatives than what we offer, which could result in a loss of advertising customers or lower advertising rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial performance;\n\u2022\nthe impact of potential new royalties charged for terrestrial radio broadcasting, which could materially increase our expenses;\n\u2022\nunfavorable shifts in population and other demographics, which may cause us to lose advertising customers as people migrate to markets where we have a smaller presence or which may cause advertisers to be willing to pay less in advertising fees if the general population shifts into a less desirable age or geographical demographic from an advertising perspective;\n\u2022\nadverse political effects and acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts; and\n\u2022\nunfavorable changes in labor conditions, which may impair our ability to operate or require us to spend more to retain and attract key employees.\nIn addition, on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the \"U.K.\") held a referendum in which voters approved an exit of the U.K. from the European Union (the \"E.U.\"), commonly referred to as \"Brexit\". International outdoor is currently headquartered in the U.K. and transacts business in many key European markets. The U.K. is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the E.U. scheduled for March 29, 2019. In November 2018, the U.K. and the E.U. agreed upon a draft Withdrawal Agreement that sets out the terms of the U.K.\u2019s departure. On January 15, 2019, the draft Withdrawal Agreement was rejected by the U.K. Parliament creating significant uncertainty about the terms (and timing) under which the U.K. will leave the E.U. and the consequent impact on the economies of the U.K., the E.U. and other countries. This uncertainty may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce the amount they spend on advertising. Any of these or similar effects of Brexit could adversely impact our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe success of our street furniture and transit products businesses is dependent on our obtaining key municipal concessions, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms.\nOur street furniture and transit products businesses require us to obtain and renew contracts with municipalities and transit authorities. Many of these contracts, which require us to participate in competitive bidding processes at each renewal, typically have terms ranging up to 15 years and have revenue share, capital expenditure requirements and/or fixed payment components. Competitive bidding processes are complex and sometimes lengthy and substantial costs may be incurred in connection with preparing bids.\nOur competitors, individually or through relationships with third parties, may be able to provide different or greater capabilities or prices or benefits than we can provide. In the past we have not been, and most likely in the future will not be, awarded all of the contracts on which we bid. The success of our business also depends generally on our ability to obtain and renew contracts with private landlords. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, be able to renew existing contracts (on the same or better terms, or at all) or be able to replace any revenue lost upon expiration or completion of a contract. Our inability to renew existing contracts may also result in significant expenses from the removal of our displays. Furthermore, if and when we do obtain a contract, we are generally required to incur significant start-up expenses. The costs of bidding on contracts and the start-up costs associated with new contracts we may obtain may significantly reduce our cash flow and liquidity.\nThis competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to estimate accurately the revenue derived from and the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win or anticipate changes in the operating environment on which our financial proposal was based; and\n\u2022\nwe may encounter expenses and delays if our competitors challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.\nOur inability to successfully negotiate, renew or complete these contracts due to third-party or governmental demands and delay and the highly competitive bidding processes for these contracts could affect our ability to offer these products to our clients, or to offer them to our clients at rates that are competitive to other forms of advertising, without adversely affecting our financial results.\nFuture dispositions, acquisitions and other strategic transactions could pose risks.\nWe frequently evaluate strategic opportunities both within and outside our existing lines of business. We expect from time to time to pursue strategic dispositions of certain businesses as well as acquisitions. These dispositions or acquisitions could be material. Dispositions and acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nour dispositions may negatively impact revenues from our national, regional and other sales networks;\n\u2022\nour dispositions may make it difficult to generate cash flows from operations sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements, including debt service requirements;\n\u2022\nour acquisitions may prove unprofitable and fail to generate anticipated cash flows:\n\u2022\nto successfully manage our large portfolio of iHeartMedia, outdoor advertising and other businesses, we may need to:\n\u25aa\nrecruit additional senior management as we cannot be assured that senior management of acquired businesses will continue to work for us and we cannot be certain that our recruiting efforts will succeed, and\n\u25aa\nexpand corporate infrastructure to facilitate the integration of our operations with those of acquired businesses, because failure to do so may cause us to lose the benefits of any expansion that we decide to undertake by leading to disruptions in our ongoing businesses or by distracting our management;\n\u2022\nwe may enter into markets and geographic areas where we have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; and\n\u2022\nour management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns.\nDispositions and acquisitions of media and entertainment businesses and outdoor advertising businesses may require antitrust review by U.S. federal antitrust agencies and may require review by foreign antitrust agencies under the antitrust laws of foreign jurisdictions. We can give no assurances that the DOJ, the FTC or foreign antitrust agencies will not seek to bar us from disposing of or acquiring media and entertainment businesses or outdoor advertising businesses or impose stringent undertaking on our business as a condition to the completion of an acquisition in any market where we already have a significant position.\nFurther, radio acquisitions are subject to FCC approval. Such transactions must comply with the Communications Act and FCC regulatory requirements and policies, including with respect to the number of broadcast facilities in which a person or entity may have an ownership or attributable interest in a given local market and the level of interest that may be held by a foreign individual or entity. The FCC's media ownership rules remain subject to ongoing agency and court proceedings. Future changes could restrict our ability to dispose of or acquire new radio assets or businesses. In addition, dispositions and acquisitions outside of the ordinary course of business during the Chapter 11 Cases will be subject to Bankruptcy Court approval.\nExtensive current government regulation, and future regulation, may limit our radio broadcasting and other iHeartMedia operations or adversely affect our business and financial results.\nCongress and several federal agencies, including the FCC, extensively regulate the domestic radio industry. For example, the FCC could impact our profitability by imposing large fines on us if, in response to pending or future complaints, it finds that we broadcast indecent programming or committed other violations of FCC regulations. Additionally, we cannot be sure that the FCC will approve renewal of the licenses we must have in order to operate our stations. Nor can we be assured that our licenses will be renewed without conditions and for a full term. The non-renewal, or conditioned renewal, of a substantial number of our FCC licenses could have a materially adverse impact on our operations. Furthermore, possible changes in interference protections, spectrum allocations and other technical rules may negatively affect the operation of our stations. For example, in October 2015, the FCC proposed rules which could reduce the degree of interference protection afforded to certain of our AM radio stations that serve wide areas. The FCC is also considering the adoption of rules which may limit our ability to prevent interference by FM translators to the reception of our full-power radio stations. In addition, Congress, the FCC and other regulatory agencies have considered, and may in the future consider and adopt, new laws, regulations and policies that could, directly or indirectly, have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance. For example, Congress may consider and adopt legislation that would impose an obligation upon all U.S. broadcasters to pay performing artists a royalty for the on-air broadcast of their sound recordings (this would be in addition to payments already made by broadcasters to owners of musical work rights, such as songwriters, composers and publishers). In October 2018, legislation was signed into law that creates a public performance right for pre-February 15, 1972 recordings streamed online. This law may increase our licensing costs. Moreover, it is possible that our license fees and negotiating costs associated with obtaining rights to use musical compositions and sound recordings in our programming content could sharply increase as a result of private negotiations, one or more regulatory rate-setting processes, or administrative and court decisions. The CRB has issued a final determination establishing copyright royalty rates for the public performance and ephemeral reproduction of sound recordings by various non-interactive webcasters, including radio broadcasters that simulcast their terrestrial programming online, to apply to the period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2020 under the webcasting statutory license. A proceeding to establish the rates for 2021-2025 is expected to begin in 2019. Increased royalty rates could significantly increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our business. Additionally, there are conditions applicable to the webcasting statutory license. Some, but not all, record companies have agreed to waive or provide limited relief from certain of these conditions under certain circumstances for set periods of time. Some of these conditions may be inconsistent with customary radio broadcasting practices. Finally, various regulatory matters relating to our iHM business are now, or may become, the subject of court litigation, and we cannot predict the outcome of any such litigation or its impact on our business.\nGovernment regulation of outdoor advertising may restrict our outdoor advertising operations.\nU.S. federal, state and local regulations have a significant impact on the outdoor advertising industry and our business. One of the seminal laws is the HBA, which regulates outdoor advertising on controlled roads in the United States. The HBA regulates the size and location of billboards, mandates a state compliance program, requires the development of state standards, promotes the expeditious removal of illegal signs and requires just compensation for takings. Construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, upgrading, height, size, spacing, the location and permitting of billboards and the use of new technologies for changing displays, such as digital displays, are regulated by federal, state and local governments. From time to time, states and municipalities have prohibited or significantly limited the construction of new outdoor advertising structures. Changes in laws and regulations affecting outdoor advertising, or changes in the interpretation of those laws and regulations, at any level of government, including the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, could have a significant financial impact on us by requiring us to make significant expenditures or otherwise limiting or restricting some of our operations. Due to such regulations, it has become increasingly difficult to develop new outdoor advertising locations.\nFrom time to time, certain state and local governments and third parties have attempted to force the removal of our displays under various state and local laws, including zoning ordinances, permit enforcement and condemnation. Similar risks also arise in certain of our international jurisdictions. Certain zoning ordinances provide for amortization, which is the required removal of legal non-conforming billboards (billboards which conformed with applicable laws and regulations when built, but which do not conform to current laws and regulations) or the commercial advertising placed on such billboards after a period of years. Pursuant to this concept, the governmental body asserts that just compensation is earned by continued operation of the billboard over that period of time. Although amortization is prohibited along all controlled roads, amortization has been upheld along non-controlled roads in limited instances where permitted by state and local law. Other regulations limit our ability to rebuild,\nreplace, repair, maintain and upgrade non-conforming displays. In addition, from time to time third parties or local governments assert that we own or operate displays that either are not properly permitted or otherwise are not in strict compliance with applicable law. If we are increasingly unable to resolve such allegations or obtain acceptable arrangements in circumstances in which our displays are subject to removal, modification or amortization, or if there occurs an increase in such regulations or their enforcement, our operating results could suffer.\nA number of state and local governments have implemented or initiated taxes, fees and registration requirements in an effort to decrease or restrict the number of outdoor signs and/or to raise revenue. From time to time, legislation also has been introduced in international jurisdictions attempting to impose taxes on revenue from outdoor advertising or for the right to use outdoor advertising assets. In addition, a number of jurisdictions have implemented legislation or interpreted existing legislation to restrict or prohibit the installation of digital billboards, and we expect these efforts to continue. The increased imposition of these measures, and our inability to overcome any such measures, could reduce our operating income if those outcomes require removal or restrictions on the use of preexisting displays or limit growth of digital displays. In addition, if we are unable to pass on the cost of these items to our clients, our operating income could be adversely affected.\nInternational regulation of the outdoor advertising industry can vary by municipality, region and country, but generally limits the size, placement, nature and density of out-of-home displays. Other regulations limit the subject matter, animation and language of out-of-home displays. Our failure to comply with these or any future international regulations could have an adverse impact on the effectiveness of our displays or their attractiveness to clients as an advertising medium and may require us to make significant expenditures to ensure compliance and avoid certain penalties or contractual breaches. As a result, we may experience a significant impact on our operations, revenue, international client base and overall financial condition.\nRegulations and consumer concerns regarding privacy and data protection, or any failure to comply with these regulations, could hinder our operations.\nWe utilize demographic and other information from and about our listeners, consumers, business partners and advertisers as they interact with us. For example: (1) our broadcast radio station websites and our iHeartRadio digital platform collect personal information as users register for our services, fill out their listener profiles, post comments, use our social networking features, participate in polls and contests and sign-up to receive email newsletters; (2) we use tracking technologies, such as \u201ccookies,\u201d to manage and track our listeners\u2019 interactions with us so that we can deliver relevant music content and advertising; (3) we collect credit card or debit card information from consumers, business partners and advertisers who use our services; and (4) we collect precise location data about certain of our Platform users for analytics, attribution and advertising purposes.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy, among other things. Many of these laws are still evolving, new laws may be enacted and any of these laws could be amended or interpreted by the courts or regulators in ways that could harm our business. For example, our ongoing efforts to comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation, effective as of May 2018, or the new California Consumer Privacy Act effective as of January 2020 may entail substantial expenses, may divert resources from other initiatives and projects, and could limit the services we are able to offer. In addition, changes in consumer expectations and demands regarding privacy and data protection could restrict our ability to collect, use, disclose and derive economic value from demographic and other information related to our listeners, consumers, business partners and advertisers, or to transfer employee data within the corporate group. Such restrictions could limit our ability to provide customized music content to our listeners, interact directly with our listeners and consumers and offer targeted advertising opportunities to our business partners and advertisers. Although we have implemented and are implementing policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws and regulations, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our policies or applicable regulatory requirements related to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy could result in a loss of confidence in us, damage to our brands, the loss of listeners, consumers, business partners and advertisers, as well as proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could hinder our operations and adversely affect our business.\nIf our security measures are breached, we could lose valuable information, suffer disruptions to our business, and incur expenses and liabilities including damages to our relationships with listeners, consumers, business partners and advertisers.\nAlthough we have implemented physical and electronic security measures that are designed to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of our websites, digital assets and proprietary business information as well as listener, consumer, business partner and advertiser personally identifiable information, no security measures are perfect and impenetrable and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access. A security breach could occur due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance or a combination of these or other actions. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, we could lose competitively sensitive business information or suffer disruptions to our business operations, information processes or internal controls. In addition, the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or services could be harmed, we could lose listeners, consumers, business partners and advertisers. In the event of a security breach, we could suffer financial exposure\nin connection with penalties, remediation efforts, investigations and legal proceedings and changes in our security and system protection measures. Currently, not all of our systems are fully compliant with the new GDPR standards and, as a result, we may face additional liability in the event of a security breach. The scope of many of the requirements under the GDPR remain unclear. Future case law may determine that the steps we are taking to comply with the GDPR may not be sufficient.\nRestrictions on outdoor advertising of certain products may restrict the categories of clients that can advertise using our products.\nOut-of-court settlements between the major U.S. tobacco companies and all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories include a ban on the outdoor advertising of tobacco products. Other products and services may be targeted in the U.S. in the future, including alcohol products. Most E.U. countries, among other nations, also have banned outdoor advertisements for tobacco products and regulate alcohol advertising. Localized restrictions on the location of advertising for High Fat, Salt and Sugar (\u201cHFSS\u201d) foods have been implemented in the UK. Regulations vary across the countries in which we conduct business. Any significant reduction in advertising of products due to content-related restrictions could cause a reduction in our direct revenues from such advertisements and an increase in the available space on the existing inventory of billboards in the outdoor advertising industry.\nEnvironmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations may limit or restrict some of our operations.\nAs the owner or operator of various real properties and facilities, especially in our outdoor advertising operations, we must comply with various foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations. We and our properties are subject to such laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, disposal, emission and release of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and employee health and safety as well as zoning restrictions. Historically, we have not incurred significant expenditures to comply with these laws. However, additional laws which may be passed in the future, or a finding of a violation of or liability under existing laws, could require us to make significant expenditures and otherwise limit or restrict some of our operations.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks because a portion of our revenue is received in foreign currencies and translated to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes.\nWe generate a portion of our revenues in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Changes in economic or political conditions, including Brexit, in any of the foreign countries in which we operate could result in exchange rate movement, new currency or exchange controls or other currency restrictions being imposed. Because we receive a portion of our revenues in currencies from the countries in which we operate, exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have an adverse effect on our profitability. A portion of our cash flows are generated in foreign currencies and translated to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, and certain of the indebtedness held by our international subsidiaries is denominated in U.S. dollars, and, therefore, significant changes in the value of such foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to meet interest and principal payments on our indebtedness.\nGiven the volatility of exchange rates, we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage our currency transaction and/or translation risks. It is possible that volatility in currency exchange rates will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We expect to experience economic losses and gains and negative and positive impacts on our operating income as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nDoing business in foreign countries exposes us to certain risks not expected to occur when doing business in the United States.\nDoing business in foreign countries carries with it certain risks that are not found when doing business in the United States. These risks could result in losses against which we are not insured. Examples of these risks include:\n\u2022\npotential adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States;\n\u2022\nhostility from local populations;\n\u2022\nthe adverse effect of foreign exchange controls;\n\u2022\ngovernment policies against businesses owned by foreigners;\n\u2022\ninvestment restrictions or requirements;\n\u2022\nexpropriations of property without adequate compensation;\n\u2022\nthe potential instability of foreign governments;\n\u2022\nthe risk of insurrections;\n\u2022\nrisks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties collecting receivables and otherwise enforcing contracts with governmental agencies and others in some foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nwithholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax structure and level; and\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations or the interpretation or application of laws or regulations.\nOur International operations involve contracts with, and regulation by, foreign governments. We operate in many parts of the world that experience corruption to some degree. Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance (including with respect to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act), our employees, subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate applicable anti-corruption laws or regulations. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nEquity investors continue to have influence on us.\nPrivate equity funds sponsored by or co-investors with Bain Capital and THL currently hold all of our outstanding shares of Class B common stock and Class C common stock, which collectively represent approximately 68% of the voting power of all of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, Bain Capital and THL have the power to elect all but two of our directors, appoint new management and approve any action requiring the approval of the holders of our capital stock. Although during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, many material corporate actions outside of the ordinary course of business are subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, Bain Capital and THL and the directors elected by Bain Capital and THL have had, and will continue to have, influence over decisions affecting us during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. This report contains various forward-looking statements which represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events, including, without limitation, our future operating and financial performance, our ability to comply with the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness and the availability of capital and the terms thereof.
