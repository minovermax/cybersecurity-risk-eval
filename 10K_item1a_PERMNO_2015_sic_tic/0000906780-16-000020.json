{"cik": "906780", "company": "EMPIRE RESORTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information contained in this report on Form 10-K, the following Risk Factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nThe development of Montreign Resort Casino, the Golf Course and Entertainment Village require additional equity capital and debt financing. If the Company is unable to raise the additional financing needed to complete these projects, the Company\u2019s business will be materially adversely affected.\nThe development of Montreign Resort Casino, the Golf Course and the Entertainment Village require additional equity capital and debt financing. We have received a commitment to participate in, and backstop, the Follow-On Rights Offering in the amount of $35 million, from Kien Huat. In addition, the CS Commitment Letter provides a commitment from Credit Suisse to provide debt financing in the amount of up to $545 million. We will need to complete both the additional equity and debt financings in order to complete the development of the Development Projects. If we are unable to obtain the necessary financing on terms and conditions acceptable to the Company, whether pursuant to the Follow-on Rights Offering and the CS Commitment Letter, or other sources of financing, our business, financial condition and prospects will be materially adversely affected.\nIf revenues and operating income from our operations at Monticello Casino and Raceway do not increase, it could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThere can be no assurance that our current operations will draw sufficient patrons to Monticello Casino and Raceway to increase our revenues to the point that we will recognize net income. The operations and placement of our VGMs, including the layout and distribution, are under the jurisdiction of the NYSGC and the program contemplates that a significant share of the responsibility for marketing the program will be borne by the NYSGC. The NYSGC is not required to make decisions that we feel are in our best interest and, as a consequence, the profitability of our VGM operations may not reach the levels that we believe to be feasible or may be slower than expected in reaching those levels. By statute, from April 1, 2008 until March 31, 2016, 41% of gross VGM revenue is distributed to us. Unless the 2016-2017 State Budget, which we anticipate will be adopted before March 31, 2016, contains a provision to extend this share percentage of gross VGM revenue to March 31, 2017, effective as of April 1, 2016, only 39% of gross VGM revenue will be distributed to us beginning on April 1, 2016. No assurance can be given that such revenue will be sufficient to generate a profit or continue to do so. Our operations are subject to many regulatory, competitive, economic and business risks beyond our control, and a change in this regard could have a material adverse impact on our operations and our business prospects.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent on the operations of our subsidiary, MRMI, to pay dividends or make distributions in order to generate internal cash flow. Moreover, until the development of the Casino Project and portions of Adelaar are complete, our subsidiaries involved in such development will generate no revenue, which will adversely impact our cash flow.\nWe are a holding company with no revenue generating operations. In addition, three of our subsidiaries are involved in the development of the Casino Project and portions of Adelaar and will generate no revenues or cash flow until the completion of such projects. Consequently, our ability to meet our working capital requirements and to service our debt obligations depends on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our sole operating subsidiary, MRMI. While our current operations generate sufficient cash flow to fund our current obligations, there can be no assurance that MRMI will generate sufficient revenue to make cash distributions in an amount necessary for us to satisfy our working capital requirements or our obligations under any current or future indebtedness. In addition, MRMI or any other subsidiary may enter into contracts that limit or prohibit its ability to make distributions. Should our subsidiaries be unable to make distributions, our ability to meet our ongoing obligations would be jeopardized. Specifically, without the making of distributions, we would be unable to pay our employees, accounting professionals or legal professionals, all of whom we rely on to manage our operations, ensure regulatory compliance and sustain our public company status.\nChanges in the laws, regulations, and ordinances (including local laws) to which the gaming industry is subject, and the application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations, or our inability or the inability of our subsidiaries, key personnel, significant stockholders, or joint venture partners to obtain or maintain required gaming regulatory licenses, permits or approvals could prevent us from pursuing future development projects or otherwise adversely impact our results of operation.\nThe ownership, management and operation of our current and any future gaming facilities are and will be subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, and/or local laws, regulations and ordinances that are administered by the relevant regulatory agency or agencies in each jurisdiction. These laws, regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibilities, financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations, and often require such parties to obtain certain licenses, permits and approvals. In addition, some of the licenses that we and our subsidiaries, officers, directors and principal stockholders hold expire after a relatively short period and thus require frequent renewals and reevaluations. Obtaining these licenses in the first place and the renewal process involves a subjective determination by the regulatory agencies. If we or our subsidiaries do not obtain and maintain the required licenses, permits and approvals, we may be required to divest our interest in our current or future gaming facilities or our current gaming facility risks losing its licenses. These laws, regulations and ordinances may also affect the operations of our gaming facilities or our plans in pursuing future projects.\nThe Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law of New York State requires our stockholders to possess certain qualifications. If the NYSGC believes a stockholder does not meet their subjective determination, a stockholder may be forced to sell any stock they hold and such sale may result in a material loss of investment value for the stockholder.\nThe Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law of New York State requires our stockholders to possess certain qualifications. A failure to possess such qualifications could lead to a material loss of investment by either us or our stockholders, as it would require divestiture of the stockholder\u2019s direct or indirect interest in us. Consequently, should any stockholder ever fail to meet the qualifications necessary to own a direct or indirect interest in us by NYSGC, such stockholder\ncould be forced to liquidate all interests in us. Should such stockholder be forced to liquidate these interests within a relatively short period of time, such stockholder would likely be forced to sell at a discount, causing a material loss of investment value.\nThe gaming industry in the northeastern United States is highly competitive, with many of our competitors better known and better financed than us.\nThe gaming industry in the northeastern United States is highly competitive and increasingly dominated by multinational corporations or Native American tribes that enjoy widespread name recognition, established brand loyalty, decades of casino operation experience, and a diverse portfolio of gaming assets and substantially greater financial resources.\nWe face competition for our VGM operations from Yonkers Raceway which is located within the New York City metropolitan area. The Yonkers facility, which is much closer to New York City, has a harness horseracing facility, approximately 5,300 VGMs, food and beverage outlets and other amenities. In contrast, we have limited financial resources and currently operate our harness horse racing facility and VGMs in Monticello, New York, which is approximately a one and a half hour drive from New York City.\nPennsylvania casinos may operate table games and slot machines, have the ability to grant credit to guests of the casino and have the ability to award an unlimited amount of non-taxable free play to their guests. Pennsylvania legalized the operation of up to 61,000 slot machines at 14 locations throughout the state. As of March 3, 2016, there were twelve casinos in operation within Pennsylvania, with six located at race tracks. One such racetrack facility is the Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs, which has approximately 2,300 slot machines and 87 table games, including 18 poker tables, and a hotel and spa. The Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, is approximately 70 miles southwest of Monticello. In addition, the Mount Airy Casino Resort has approximately 1,870 slot machines and 80 table games, including 9 poker tables, a hotel, spa, and a golf course. The Mount Airy Casino Resort is located in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, approximately 60 miles southwest of Monticello. Any expansion of these casinos in Pennsylvania will likely increase the degree of competition within our market and may have an adverse effect on our business and future operating performance.\nNo assurance can be given that we will be able to compete successfully for gaming customers with the established casinos in Pennsylvania or the competing VGM facility at Yonkers Raceway.\nThe continuing decline in the popularity of horse racing, decline of the horse population and increasing competition in simulcasting could adversely impact the business of Monticello Casino and Raceway.\nSince the mid-1980s, there has been a general decline in the number of people attending and wagering at live horse races at North American racetracks due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other forms of gaming, unwillingness of guests to travel a significant distance to racetracks and the increasing availability of off-track wagering. The declining attendance at live horse racing events has prompted racetracks to rely increasingly on revenues from inter-track, off-track and account wagering markets. The industry-wide focus on inter-track, off-track and account wagering markets has increased competition among racetracks for outlets to simulcast their live races. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, we generated approximately $3.3 million, $1.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively, of revenues from the import and export simulcasting of out-of-state racing, of which approximately $1.7 million, $900,000 and $2.0 million, respectively, were due to the horsemen. A continued decrease in attendance at live events and in on-track wagering, continued decline in the horse population and increased competition in the inter-track, off-track and account wagering markets, could lead to a decrease in the amount wagered at Monticello Casino and Raceway. Our business plan anticipates the possibility of Monticello Casino and Raceway attracting new guests to our racetrack wagering operations through VGMs in order to offset the general decline in raceway attendance. However, even if our VGM operations attract new guests to our racetrack, we may not be able to generate profit from operations. Public tastes are unpredictable and subject to change. Any further decline in interest in horse racing or any change in public tastes may adversely affect our revenues and, therefore, limit our ability to make a positive contribution to our results of operation.\nWe depend on our key personnel and the loss of their services would adversely affect our operations and business strategy.\nIf we are unable to maintain our key personnel and attract new employees with high levels of expertise in the gaming areas in which we engage and propose to engage, or are unable to do so without unreasonably increasing our labor costs, the execution of our business strategy may be hindered and our growth limited. We believe that our success is largely dependent on the continued employment of our executive management and the hiring of strategic key personnel at reasonable costs. Competition for qualified executives is intense and we can give no assurance that we would be able to hire a qualified replacement with the required level of experience and expertise for any current members of our senior management, if required to do so. Accordingly, if any of our current key executives were unable or unwilling to continue in his or her present position, or we were unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified employees at reasonable rates, our business, results of operations\nand financial condition will be materially adversely affected. Additionally, recruiting and hiring a replacement for any executive management position could divert the attention of other senior management and increase our operating expenses.\nRisks Relating to the Casino Project and Adelaar\nThe development of the Montreign Resort Casino, the Golf Course and Entertainment Village will be capital intensive and we may not be able to proceed with the development project because of market conditions, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe development of Montreign Resort Casino will require substantial additional capital and will generate no cash flow until the project is complete. The Company is required to make a Minimum Capital Investment of $651 million in the Initial Projects and on March 1, 2016, the Minimum Capital Investment Deposit, in the aggregate amount of $85.4 million, was made. Montreign's portion of the Minimum Capital Investment Deposit was made in the form of a deposit bond representing approximately $65 million, which is 10% of the Company's Minimum Capital Investment in the Casino Project, Golf Course and Entertainment Village and EPR's portion was made in the form of a deposit bond representing approximately $20 million, which is 10% of their Minimum Capital Investment in the Infrastructure and the Waterpark. The January 2016 Rights Offering generated net proceeds of $285.9 million, which will be used (i) for the expenses relating to the development of the Casino Project, (ii) to redeem the Series E Preferred Stock in accordance with an existing settlement agreement and (iii) for the expenses related to the development of the Golf Course and Entertainment Village and to support the working capital needs of the Company. Kien Huat has agreed to participate in, and backstop, a further rights offering in an amount not to exceed $35 million in support of the Initial Projects, which commitment is discussed further below. In addition, the Company obtained the CS Credit Commitment (as defined below), pursuant to which Credit Suisse AG (\"Credit Suisse\") has committed to provide up to $545 million of debt financing. However, the Company has reserved the flexibility to reassess financing alternatives and either proceed with such debt financing or pursue alternative means of debt financing on terms and conditions more beneficial to the Company. However, we may not be able to obtain such alternative debt financing because of market conditions. If we are unable to obtain the additional financing necessary to complete the development of the Initial Projects on terms and conditions that are acceptable to the Company, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected. The level of indebtedness will likely have several important effects on future operations, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\na portion of cash flow from current operations may be dedicated to the payment of any interest and/or principal required with respect to outstanding indebtedness while we are developing the Casino Project;\n\u2022\nthe debt documents may contain restrictive covenants curtailing operations and finances;\n\u2022\nincreases in outstanding indebtedness and leverage may increase vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, as well as to competitive pressure;\n\u2022\ndepending on the levels of outstanding indebtedness, our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, general corporate and other purposes may be limited, and\n\u2022\ncovenants may restrict dividends and transfer of funds from the operating entity to Empire.\nThe ability to make payments of principal and interest on indebtedness will depend upon future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. If sufficient cash flow is not generated from operations to service such debt, requirements among other things, may be to:\n\u2022\nseek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;\n\u2022\ndelay, curtail or abandon altogether our development plans;\n\u2022\nrefinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness; or\n\u2022\nsell selected assets.\nSuch measures might be insufficient to service the indebtedness. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If funds are not available when needed, or available on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some of our obligations with respect to the Adelaar Project and our Casino Project. In addition, we may not be able to grow market share, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements, which could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFailure to finalize and draw upon our CS Credit Commitment would mean we would need to find alternative funding sources, could result in less attractive financing terms and could delay or preclude the construction of Montreign Resort Casino.\nThe Company has entered into a commitment letter with Credit Suisse for the provision of a senior secured credit facility of up to $545 million to construct the Montreign Resort Casino (the \"CS Credit Commitment\"). The CS Credit Commitment is not a binding agreement to provide us loans and remains subject to the execution of definitive documentation, negotiation of material terms and conditions and syndication, due diligence, receipt of certain credit ratings and several other material conditions precedent to closing and funding. There can be no assurance that the definitive terms and conditions of the credit facility under the CS Credit Commitment will not differ materially from those currently contemplated or that all the conditions to close and fund will be met by that time or at all. If we were unable to finalize and borrow under the CS Credit Commitment, we may have to find a new group of lenders and negotiate new financing terms or consider other financing alternatives. If required, it is possible that new financing would not be available or would have to be procured on substantially less attractive terms, which could damage the economic viability of Montreign Resort Casino. The need to arrange such alternative financing would likely also delay the construction of Montreign Resort Casino, which would affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe development costs associated with our portion of the Initial Projects may increase due to significant risks inherent in construction projects.\nThe development of our portion of the Initial Projects subjects us to significant risks inherent in the construction of a new facility, including unanticipated design, construction, regulatory and environmental problems. Our portion of the Initial Projects could also experience:\n\u2022\nchanges to plans and specifications (some of which may require the approval of the NYSGC);\n\u2022\ndelays and significant cost increases;\n\u2022\nshortages of materials;\n\u2022\nshortages of skilled labor or work stoppages for contractors and subcontractors;\n\u2022\ninability of contractors and subcontractors to obtain and maintain required licenses issued by the NYSGC;\n\u2022\ninability to meet minority and women owned business entity participation goals;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes or work stoppages;\n\u2022\ndisputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;\n\u2022\nhealth and safety incidents and site accidents;\n\u2022\nengineering problems, including defective plans and specifications;\n\u2022\npoor performance or nonperformance by any third parties on whom we place reliance;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations, applicable to gaming;\n\u2022\nfacilities, real estate development or construction projects;\n\u2022\nunforeseen construction scheduling, engineering, environmental, permitting, construction or geological problems;\n\u2022\nenvironmental issues, including the discovery of unknown environmental contamination;\n\u2022\nweather interference, floods, fires or other casualty losses;\n\u2022\nother unanticipated circumstances or cost increases; and\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain necessary licenses, permits, entitlements or other governmental approvals.\nThe occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs of our portion of the Initial Projects and Adelaar or delay or prevent the construction or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of our portion of the Initial Projects and Adelaar, all of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and cause us to require additional external financing.\nIn combination with existing and proposed casinos in New York State and nearby states, Montreign Resort Casino will face intense competition that may adversely impact our ability to meet our development goals.\nA number of Native American tribes and gaming entrepreneurs are seeking to develop casinos in New York and Connecticut in areas that are 90 miles from New York City such as Bridgeport, Connecticut and Southampton, New York. Further, it is possible that a referendum will be placed on the ballot in November 2016 to enable voters in New Jersey to vote whether or not to amend the New Jersey State Constitution to permit two casinos in northern New Jersey. We are unable to predict when or if laws would be amended to permit such tribes and entrepreneurs to develop casinos in New York and nearby states. Depending on the size, location and scope and gaming tax rate, if casinos are built in northern New Jersey, they may adversely impact our current operations and the prospects for the Casino Project. Based on proximity, a gaming facility in any of the nearby states, which would include a casino, hotel, restaurants and retail shops, could likely significantly increase the competition we face and have a material adverse effect on our business operations and future performance.\nMontreign Resort Casino has no operating history and our projections on the operations of such property may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future operating results and prospects.\nThere is no limited historical information available about Montreign Resort Casino upon which you can base your evaluation of business and prospects of such project. The development of Montreign Resort is in the very early stages and will generate no revenue until the completion of the project. As a result, you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks, expenses and challenges that we will face as a company seeking to develop and operate a major new development project and gaming businesses in a rapidly growing and intensely competitive market.\nWe have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies developing a major new project, and those risks and difficulties may be heightened in a rapidly developing market such as the gaming market in the northeastern United States. Some of the risks relate to our ability to:\n\u2022\ncomplete our construction projects within their anticipated time schedules and budgets;\n\u2022\nattract and retain customers and qualified employees;\n\u2022\noperate, support, expand and develop our operations and our facilities;\n\u2022\nmaintain effective control of our operating costs and expenses;\n\u2022\nraise the additional capital necessary to complete Montreign Resort Casino;\n\u2022\ndevelop and maintain internal personnel, systems and procedures to assure compliance with the extensive regulatory requirements applicable to the gaming business;\n\u2022\nrespond to changes in our regulatory environment; and\n\u2022\nrespond to competitive market conditions.\nIf we are unable to complete any of these tasks, we may be unable to complete and operate Montreign Resort Casino in the manner we contemplate and generate revenues in the amounts and by the times we anticipate. We may also be unable to meet the conditions to draw on one or more of our financing facilities to be obtained in order to fund our development and construction activities or may suffer a default under one or more of our financing facilities. If any of these events were to occur, it would cause a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.\nWork stoppages, labor problems and unexpected shutdowns may limit our operational flexibility and negatively impact our future profits.\nWe expect the labor used in the construction of the Initial Projects will be members of various unions. If we are unable to negotiate agreements with these labor unions on mutually acceptable terms, the affected employees may engage in a strike or other job actions, which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Any unexpected shutdown of the development and construction of the Initial Projects from a work stoppage or strike action could have a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations. Moreover, strikes, work stoppages or other job actions could also result in adverse media attention or otherwise discourage customers, including convention and meeting groups, from visiting our other property, Monticello Raceway and Casino. We cannot assure that we can be adequately prepared for labor developments that may lead to a temporary or permanent shutdown of any of our development project.\nEven if Montreign Resort Casino, the Entertainment Village and the Golf Course are completed as planned and opened, they may not be financially successful, which would limit our cash flow and would adversely affect our operations and our ability to repay our debt.\nEven if Montreign Resort Casino, the Entertainment Village and the Golf Course are completed as planned and opened, one or more still may not be a financially successful venture or generate the cash flows that we anticipate. We may not attract the level of patronage that we are seeking. If Montreign Resort Casino, the Entertainment Village or the Golf Course do not attract sufficient business, this will limit our cash flow and would adversely affect our operations and our ability to service payments under our loan facilities.\nConstruction at Montreign Resort Casino, the Entertainment Village and the Golf Course is subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or loss of life, thereby subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by insurance.\nThe construction of large scale properties such as Montreign Resort Casino, the Entertainment Village and the Golf Course can be dangerous. Construction workers at our projects are subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or loss of life, thereby subjecting the contractor and us to liabilities, possible losses, delays in completion of the projects and negative publicity. In the event of such accidents, we may stop construction for several days to allow for safety inspections and investigations. We and our contractors will take safety precautions that are consistent with industry practice, but these safety precautions may not be adequate to prevent serious personal injuries or further loss of life, damage to property or delays. If\naccidents occur during the construction of Montreign Resort Casino, the Entertainment Village or the Golf Course, we may be subject to delays, including delays imposed by regulators, liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by insurance, and our business, prospects and reputation may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior management, and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services or their other responsibilities cause them to be unable to devote sufficient time and attention to the development of the Initial Projects.\nWe will place substantial reliance on the gaming, project development and hospitality industry experience and knowledge of the Northeast U.S. gaming market possessed by members of our senior management team. The loss of the services of one or more of these members of our senior management team could hinder our ability to effectively manage our business and implement our growth and development strategies. Finding suitable replacements for members of our senior management could be difficult, and competition for personnel of similar experience could be intense.\nGaming is a highly regulated industry and adverse changes or developments in gaming laws or regulations could be difficult to comply with or significantly increase our costs, which could cause our projects to be unsuccessful.\nGaming is a highly regulated industry. Current laws, such as licensing requirements, tax rates and other regulatory obligations, including for anti-money laundering, could change or become more stringent resulting in additional regulations being imposed upon the development of Montreign Resort Casino and the gaming operations or a further liberalization of competition being introduced in the gaming industry. Any such adverse developments in the regulation of the gaming industry in New York could be difficult to comply with and significantly increase our costs, which could cause Montreign Resort Casino to be unsuccessful.\nNew York State could grant additional gaming facility licenses in our Area or in New York City or the surrounding counties earlier than the expected seven-year blackout period, which could significantly increase the already intense competition in the Northeast U.S. and cause us to lose or be unable to gain market share.\nThe Upstate Gaming and Economic Development Act provides for the award of up to four (4) gaming facility licenses in three regions of upstate New York, including our Area, and prohibits the issuance of gaming facility licenses in the \u201cdownstate\u201d region, which includes New York City and its surrounding counties. The award of such a gaming facility license is intended to be exclusive for a period of seven (7) years commencing on the date of award. We can provide no assurance that the New York State government will not change this law and issue additional gaming facility licenses before the expiration of this seven-year exclusivity period. If the New York State government were to allow additional competitors to operate in our Area or in other regions of New York through the grant of additional gaming facility licenses, we would face additional competition, which could significantly increase the already intense competition in the Northeast U.S. and cause us to lose or be unable to gain market share.\nOn March 7, 2012, Concord filed a complaint against EPR and us seeking monetary damages and permanent injunctive relief against EPR and us relating to our joint development of the EPT Property. This litigation may delay or alter our plans for the development of the Adelaar Project.\nOn September 18, 2013, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (\u201cSDNY\u201d) granted Motions to Dismiss filed by us and all other defendants. This lawsuit was filed in March 2012 by Concord and various affiliates in the SDNY and asserted in an amended complaint various federal antitrust claims against us, EPR, EPT, Genting NY LLC and Kien Huat. The lawsuit arises out of our exclusivity agreement and option agreement with EPT to develop the site of the EPT Property located in Sullivan County, New York. Concord brought federal antitrust claims alleging conspiracy in restraint of trade, conspiracy to monopolize and monopolization. Concord also brought state law claims for tortious interference with contract and business relations. Concord sought damages in an amount to be determined at trial but not less than subject to automatic trebling under federal antitrust laws), unspecified punitive damages and permanent injunctive relief. In its decision, the SDNY dismissed Concord\u2019s federal antitrust claims with prejudice and dismissed Concord's state law claims without prejudice. On October 2, 2013, Concord filed a Motion for Reconsideration and on October 18, 2013, Concord filed a Notice of Appeal. On October 22, 2013, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (\"2nd Circuit Court\") issued a Notice of Stay of Appeal pending the outcome of the Motion for Reconsideration. On November 3, 2014, SDNY denied Concord's Motion for Reconsideration. The 2nd Circuit Court lifted the Stay of Appeal and the Appeal has been fully briefed. Oral argument was heard by the 2nd Circuit Court on April 29, 2015. Although we believe this lawsuit is without merit and we will aggressively defend our interests, it may delay or alter our plans with respect to the Casino Project or Project.\nRisk Relating to our Ownership Structure\nStockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate decisions may be limited because our major stockholder owns a large percentage of our common stock.\nKien Huat Realty III Limited (\u201cKien Huat\u201d) is the beneficial holder of 27,533,067 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 88.7% of our voting power as of February 17, 2016. This reflects Kien Huat's participation and backstop of the January 2016 Rights Offering pursuant to the January 2016 Standby Purchase Agreement and the conversion of the Kien Huat Note pursuant to the terms of a loan agreement dated November 10, 2010, by and between the Company and Kien Huat (the \"Loan Agreement\"). Under the terms of an investment agreement, dated November 12, 2009 (the \u201cInvestment Agreement\u201d), between the Company and Kien Huat, if any option or warrant outstanding as of the final closing under the Investment Agreement, or the first 200,000 granted to directors or officers who served in such capacity as of the final closing date under the Investment Agreement, are exercised, Kien Huat has the right (following notice of such exercise) to purchase an equal number of additional shares of our common stock as are issued upon such exercise at the exercise price for the applicable option or warrant (such rights the \"Option Matching Rights\"). On February 17, 2016, Kien Huat declined to exercise its Option Matching Rights to acquire 204,706 shares of our common stock.\nUnder the terms of the Investment Agreement, Kien Huat is also entitled to recommend three directors whom we are required to cause to be elected or appointed to our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d), subject to the satisfaction of all legal and governance requirements regarding service as a director and to the reasonable approval of the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee of our Board. Kien Huat will continue to be entitled to recommend three directors for so long as it owns at least 24% of our voting power outstanding at such time, after which the number of directors whom Kien Huat will be entitled to designate for election to our Board will be reduced proportionally to Kien Huat\u2019s percentage of ownership. Under the Investment Agreement, for so long as Kien Huat is entitled to recommend nominees to serve as board members, among other things, Kien Huat will have the right to nominate one of its director designees to serve as the Chairman of the Board. Mr. Pearlman has been appointed to serve as Chairman of the Board pursuant to Kien Huat\u2019s recommendation. Until such time as Kien Huat ceases to own capital stock with at least 30% of our voting power outstanding at such time, our Board will be prohibited under the terms of the Investment Agreement from taking certain actions relating to fundamental transactions involving us and our subsidiaries and certain other matters without the affirmative vote of the directors recommended by Kien Huat and elected by shareholders. Consequently, Kien Huat has the ability to exert significant influence over our policies and affairs, including the election of our Board and the approval of any action requiring a stockholder vote, such as approving amendments to our certificate of incorporation and mergers or sales of substantially all of our assets, as well as other matters. Although Kien Huat has expressed no interest in doing so, Kien Huat is not restricted from acquiring additional shares of our common stock, including through open-market purchases. However, on February 17, 2016, we entered into a Letter Agreement with Kien Huat wherein Kien Huat agreed, for a period of three years, to seek certain approvals of the Board of Directors and minority shareholders in connection with any \"going-private\" transaction. Notwithstanding the Letter Agreement, this concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our Company on terms that other stockholders may desire or force the sale of our company on terms undesirable to other stockholders.\nRisks Relating to the Market Value of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile, leading to the possibility of its value being depressed at a time when our stockholders want to sell their holdings.\nThe market price of our common stock has in the past been, and may in the future continue to be, volatile. For instance, between January 1, 2015 and March 3, 2016, the closing price of our common stock has ranged between $12.17 and $37.95 per share. A variety of events may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including but not necessarily limited to:\n\u2022\nquarter to quarter variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nday traders;\n\u2022\nadverse or positive news reports or public announcements; and\n\u2022\nmarket conditions for the gaming industry.\nIn addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of companies, at times for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock and other interests in the Company at a time when our stockholders want to sell their interest in us.\nIf we fail to meet the applicable continued listing requirements of NASDAQ Global Market, NASDAQ may delist our common stock, in which case the liquidity and market price of our common stock could decline.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Global Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy certain continued listing requirements. If we are deficient in maintaining the necessary listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted. If our stock is delisted, an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nDuring the past three fiscal years, we did not declare or pay any cash dividends with respect to our common stock and we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain all future earnings for use in the development of our business. In addition, the payment of cash dividends to the holders of our common stock is restricted by undeclared dividends on our Series E preferred stock. There can be no assurance that we will have, at any time, sufficient surplus under Delaware law to be able to pay any dividends.\nFuture sales of our common stock by our insiders may cause our stock price to decline.\nA portion of our outstanding shares are held by directors and executive officers. Resales of a substantial number of shares of our stock by these stockholders, announcements of the proposed resale of substantial amounts of our stock, or the perception that substantial resales may be made by such stockholders could adversely impact the market price of our stock. Some of our directors and executive officers have entered into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans pursuant to which they have arranged to sell shares of our common stock from time to time in the future. Actual or potential sales by these insiders, including those under a pre-arranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plan may adversely impact the market price of our stock.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of shares of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, including pursuant to the Second Amendment to the Commitment Letter or the effective shelf registration statement, or the perception that such sales or conversion are likely to occur could affect the market price of our common stock. Kien Huat\u2019s stock ownership may also discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nGeneral Business Risks\nInstability and volatility in the financial markets could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe demand for entertainment and leisure activities tends to be highly sensitive to consumers\u2019 disposable income. Discretionary consumer spending habits have been adversely affected by the recent economic conditions and the actual or perceived economic conditions could lead to further decrease in spending by our guests. We cannot predict at what level these negative trends will continue, worsen or improve and the ultimate impact it will have on our future results of operations. The continued weakness in our market and the deterioration of the broader global economy would have a material adverse effect on our industry and our business, including our revenues, profitability, operating results and cash flow.\nMoreover, we will need to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to finance our plans for growth. Recent turmoil in the credit markets and the resulting impact on the liquidity of certain large financial institutions has had, and may continue to have, an effect through the U.S. economy, including limiting access to credit markets for certain borrowers at reasonable rates. Due to fluctuations in the credit markets from time to time, we may be unable to incur additional indebtedness to fund our business strategy, in the public or private markets, on terms we believe to be reasonable, if at all. Such instability and volatility in the financial markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain the financing necessary to pursue the development of the Casino Project.\nWe are subject to greater risks than a geographically diverse company.\nOur operations are limited to the Catskills region of the State of New York, which has been affected by decades-long decline in economic conditions. As a result, in addition to our susceptibility to adverse global and domestic economic, political and business conditions, any economic downturn in the region could have a material adverse effect on our operations. An economic downturn would likely cause a decline in the disposable income of consumers in the region, which could result in a decrease in the number of patrons at our facility, the frequency of their visits and the average amount that they would be willing to spend at our facility. We are subject to greater risks than more geographically diversified gaming or resort operations, including:\n\u2022\na downturn in national, regional or local economic conditions;\n\u2022\nan increase in competition in New York State or the northeastern United States and Canada, particularly for day-trip patrons residing in New York State, including as a result of any new tribal Class III casinos, destination gaming resorts or VGMs at certain racetracks and other locations in New York, Connecticut and New Jersey and casinos in Pennsylvania;\n\u2022\nimpeded access due to road construction or closures of primary access routes; and\n\u2022\nadverse weather and natural and other disasters in the northeastern United States.\nThe occurrence of any one of the events described above could cause a material disruption in our business and make us unable to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments on our obligations.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results.\nWe are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly, increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results. Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices which affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to Monticello Casino and Raceway and a reduction in our revenues.\nOur business could be affected by weather-related factors and seasonality.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by weather-related and seasonal factors. Severe winter weather conditions may deter or prevent patrons from reaching our gaming facilities or undertaking day trips. In addition, some recreational activities are curtailed during the winter months. Although our budget assumes these seasonal fluctuations in our gaming revenues to ensure adequate cash flow during expected periods of lower revenues, we cannot ensure that weather-related and seasonal factors will not have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are vulnerable to natural disasters and other disruptive events that could severely disrupt the normal operations of our business and adversely affect our earnings.\nOur operations are located at a facility in Monticello, New York. Although this area is not prone to earthquakes, floods, tornadoes, fires or other natural disasters, the occurrence of any of these events or any other cause of material disruption in our\noperation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, although we do maintain insurance customary for our industry, including a policy with $10 million limit of coverage for the perils of flood and earthquake, we cannot ensure that this coverage will be sufficient in the event of one of the disasters mentioned above.\nWe may be subject to material environmental liability as a result of unknown environmental hazards.\nWe currently own 232 acres of land. As a significant landholder, we are subject to numerous environmental laws. Specifically, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases on or relating to its property and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury and for investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. Such laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of contaminants. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial.\nPotential changes in the regulatory environment could harm our business.\nFrom time to time, legislators and special interest groups have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate or intend to operate. In addition, from time to time, certain anti-gaming groups propose referenda that, if adopted, could force us to curtail operations and incur significant losses.\nOur information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security.\nWe rely on information technology and other systems to maintain and transmit customers' personal and/or financial information, credit card information, mailing lists and other information. We have taken steps designed to safeguard our customers' personal and financial information and have implemented systems designed to meet all requirements of the Payment Card Industry standards for data protection. However, our information and processes are subject to the ever-changing threat of compromised security, in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus or unauthorized or fraudulent access or use by unauthorized individuals. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses, fines, litigation and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results. Although we have invested in and deployed security systems and developed processes that are designed to protect all sensitive data, prevent data loss and reduce the impact of any security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security.", "PERMNO": 79790, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "NYNY"}
