RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before making an investment in our common stock, you should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report, including our \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Any of the risk factors described below could significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, and prospects. As a result of the risks and uncertainties described below as well as such additional risks and uncertainties, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe ability of active duty service members to enroll in APUS\u2019s courses can be impacted by factors that we do not anticipate, which can impact APUS\u2019s registrations and make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast expected enrollment.\nDue to the variability of military activity and other factors over which we have no control, at times it may be difficult to predict American Public University System\u2019s, or APUS\u2019s, military enrollments. For example, beginning with registrations for the third quarter of 2010, growth of our net course registrations from active duty service members slowed more than we expected. While we do not know all of the factors that caused this to occur, we believe that the changes we saw in net course registrations from students who are active service members in the United States Armed Forces were in part due to increased\noperations activity and overseas deployments across all branches of the military, particularly the level of activity in the United States Marine Corps. We believe that increased demands on many active duty service members, combined with limited internet access associated with some deployments, impacted the ability of certain active duty military students to pursue higher education in 2010. Additionally, in December 2015, the U.S. Army implemented its new enrollment management tool that members of the Army must use to access the Uniform Tuition Assistance Program of the Department of Defense, or DoD tuition assistance programs. Members of the Army experienced various issues with the new enrollment management tool, including difficulty selecting APUS as an institution. We believe that the issues encountered with the new enrollment management tool may negatively impact APUS\u2019s enrollments and net course registrations during 2016. The occurrence of these or other factors in the future could make it more difficult to predict enrollments. Any decline in APUS enrollments from active duty military students could have an adverse impact on our total net course registrations and revenue.\nTuition assistance programs offered to service members of the United States Armed Forces constituted approximately 35% of APUS\u2019s adjusted net course registrations for 2015, and our revenue and number of students would decrease if APUS is no longer able to receive funds under these tuition assistance programs or if tuition assistance is reduced, eliminated, or temporarily suspended.\nService members of the United States Armed Forces are eligible to receive tuition assistance from their branch of service through the DoD tuition assistance programs. Service members may use DoD tuition assistance programs to pursue postsecondary education at institutions that are accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education and that satisfy other requirements, including execution of, and compliance with, a Memorandum of Understanding that specifies terms and conditions of participation in DoD tuition assistance programs. A significant portion of APUS students rely on DoD tuition assistance programs to pay for their education. These programs constituted approximately 35% of APUS\u2019s adjusted net course registrations for 2015. At this time, HCON does not participate in DoD tuition assistance programs.\nEven temporary suspensions of DoD tuition assistance programs adversely affect our operations. In March 2013, in response to automatic, across-the-board reductions in federal spending (also known as \u201csequestration\u201d), each of the military services suspended new enrollments in DoD tuition assistance programs. As a result of Congressional action, each of the services reinstated enrollments in DoD tuition assistance programs in April 2013. However, our results of operations in the second quarter of 2013 were negatively impacted by these actions, resulting in what we believe were fewer enrollments from service members than otherwise would have been expected. In October 2013, DoD tuition assistance programs were temporarily suspended as a result of the U.S. federal government partial shutdown. On October 1, 2013, prior to the government shutdown, APUS course registrations for October 2013 were approximately 41,200. As of October 14, 2013, however, approximately 13,100 registrations had been dropped, resulting in a net course registration reduction of approximately 20% compared to October 2012. We believe that many of these dropped registrations resulted from the suspension of DoD tuition assistance programs. Although DoD resumed its tuition assistance programs after the government shutdown ended, we do not believe that the registrations for subsequent months served to replace, or make up, all of the registrations that had been dropped. The U.S. Congress has passed legislation to extend government funding for the DoD through September 30, 2016; however, if funding is not extended beyond that date, another government shutdown could occur, resulting in another suspension of DoD tuition assistance programs. Any future government shutdown or suspension of DoD tuition assistance programs could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWhile DoD tuition assistance programs were reinstated and the government shutdown ended, budgetary pressures remain, and we do not know the full scale of future actions that may be taken with respect to DoD tuition assistance programs, which could include eliminating those programs, reducing the funds or benefits (or both) available under those programs or enacting new restrictions on participation in those programs. If funds available under DoD tuition assistance programs are reduced or eliminated, we believe that most service members would be eligible and able to finance out-of-pocket tuition costs resulting from this shortfall using their benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill or the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, as amended, or the Post-9/11 GI Bill, through the \u201cTop-Up\u201d program. The \u201cTop-Up\u201d program allows active-duty service members to use their GI Bill or Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to pay the difference between the total cost of a college course and the amount of DoD tuition assistance that is paid by the military for the course. However, we do not know whether in the long-term service members would be willing to use the Top-Up option, or whether the increased administrative process in using the Top-Up option or covering the shortfall through other funding sources would lead to service members deciding not to enroll or to enroll at a slower rate.\nOther administrative changes to DoD programs could also have negative effects on our enrollments. For example, in March 2013, DoD issued an instruction restricting the ability of service members in certain overseas duty locations outside the continental United States, or overseas locations, to receive DoD tuition assistance for courses offered by institutions of higher education that are not parties to contracts with the DoD to provide DoD voluntary education programs at those locations. Because we do not have a contract with the DoD to provide instruction at overseas locations, service members who begin a\npostsecondary education program after arrival at an applicable overseas duty location may not use DoD tuition assistance programs to pay for their education in our programs until after they have successfully completed a course with an institution that has a contract to provide voluntary education programs at that overseas location. Service members who were already enrolled in one of our programs before arriving at an overseas duty location may continue to receive DoD tuition assistance for the in-progress program, but they will be encouraged to enroll in courses provided by institutions that have entered into a contract with the DoD to provide programs at the applicable overseas duty location.\nWe are not able to estimate the effect of future expected changes to DoD tuition assistance programs or whether the services would impose other criteria in addition to the level of reimbursement that would impact enrollments from service members. Changes to the DoD tuition assistance programs have already occurred and we expect changes to the programs in the future. For example, the Air Force is no longer authorizing tuition assistance for associate\u2019s degrees if the service member already has an associate\u2019s degree from the Community College of the Air Force, the Army now requires service members to complete one year of service after graduation from Advanced Individual Training in order to be eligible for tuition assistance, the Army has reduced the total benefit per service member per year from $4,500 to $4,000, and the Marine Corps now requires Marines to have 24 months on active duty prior to being eligible to apply for Tuition Assistance. In October 2015, the Coast Guard restored tuition assistance funding to $250 per semester hour, an increase from the previous cap of $187.50 per semester hour which was implemented in 2014. Additional changes to the tuition assistance programs could occur due to Congressional action or DoD policy and funding changes.\nWe are also not able to estimate the responses that our competitors would take to reduced DoD tuition assistance payments or the willingness of service members to use their Top-Up option or other U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or VA, education benefits. In this regard, our competitors, particularly those with larger student populations or a smaller concentration of students from the military, may be better situated to lower the cost of tuition for service members. If we are no longer able to receive funds from DoD tuition assistance programs, or if those programs are reduced, eliminated, or temporarily suspended, our enrollments and revenue could be significantly reduced, which would result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe DoD's revised Memorandum of Understanding includes terms and conditions that impose extensive new regulatory requirements on APUS with respect to participation in DoD tuition assistance programs.\nUnder a DoD final rule, effective January 7, 2013, each institution participating in DoD tuition assistance programs is required to sign a Memorandum of Understanding, or MOU, outlining certain commitments and agreements between the institution and DoD prior to accepting funds from DoD tuition assistance programs. On May 15, 2014, DoD promulgated new regulations and a revised MOU, the 2014 MOU. On July 7, 2014, DoD released revisions to the 2014 MOU. Institutions were required to sign the 2014 MOU on or before September 5, 2014 in order to continue to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs. APUS signed the 2014 MOU and continues to participate in the DoD tuition assistance program subject to its terms. HCON does not participate in DoD tuition assistance programs and therefore has not signed the 2014 MOU; however, HCON may participate in DoD tuition assistance programs in the future and would become subject to the DoD requirements related to tuition assistance programs and associated risks at that time. The 2014 MOU contains many requirements and limitations that were not contained in previous MOUs to which APUS was a party. Pursuant to the 2014 MOU, among other requirements, institutions must: explain certain Department of Education, or ED, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, tools to service members, such as ED\u2019s \u201cCollege Navigator\u201d website and the CFPB\u2019s \u201cPaying for College\u201d website; comply with requirements related to readmission policies for service members; abide by new limitations on the use of funds derived from tuition assistance programs; provide additional academic and student support services; disclose information about transfer of credit; in certain circumstances, return tuition assistance program funds to DoD (such as when a student ceases to attend or an institution cancels a course); offer to service members loan counseling before private student loans are offered or recommended; and comply with ED's Title IV \u201cprogram integrity\u201d rules, including rules related to incentive payments and misrepresentation. The 2014 MOU also provides that an institution may only participate in DoD tuition assistance programs if it is accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by ED, approved for VA funding, and a participant in Title IV programs. We cannot predict how DoD will interpret and enforce these requirements or what type of immediate sanctions, if any, will be implemented before an institution loses the ability to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs for failure to comply with certain provisions of the 2014 MOU. If we fail to comply with the requirements of the 2014 MOU, we will not be able to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs, which could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf APUS does not maintain continued strong relationships with various military bases and educational service officers, and if APUS is unable to expand the use of articulation agreements, our future growth may be impaired.\nAPUS has non-exclusive articulation agreements or memoranda of understanding (separate from the 2014 MOU) with various educational institutions of the United States Armed Forces and other governmental education programs. Articulation\nagreements and memoranda of understanding are agreements pursuant to which we agree to award academic credits toward our degrees for learning in educational programs offered by others. Additionally, APUS relies on relationships with educational service offices on military bases and base education officers to distribute information about APUS to interested service members. While APUS\u2019s interactions with education service offices and military bases are governed by the terms and conditions of the 2014 MOU, the DoD also issues briefings from time to time that impact these interactions. In recent years, including as a result of DoD instructions or briefings, it has become increasingly difficult to maintain relationships with education service officers and access military bases, including because the DoD has issued briefings that specifically prohibit authorizing regular or recurring office hours for an educational institution to solely provide counseling and that prohibit allowing former military members to access installations to represent an educational institution using their government ID card privileges. If APUS\u2019s relationships with educational service offices or base education counselors deteriorate or end, or our access to bases is further restricted, our efforts to recruit students from those bases could be impaired, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. If APUS\u2019s articulation agreements and memoranda of understanding are eliminated this could also materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOn March 14, 2013, DoD issued an instruction restricting the ability of service members in certain duty locations outside the continental United States, or overseas locations, to receive DoD tuition assistance for courses offered by institutions of higher education that are not parties to contracts with the DoD to provide DoD voluntary education programs at those locations. Because we do not have contracts with the DoD to provide instruction at overseas locations, service members who begin a postsecondary education program after arrival in an applicable overseas duty location may not use DoD tuition assistance programs to pay for their education in our programs until after they have already successfully completed a course with an institution that has entered into a contract to provide voluntary education programs at that overseas location. Service members who were already enrolled in one of our programs before arriving at an overseas duty location may continue to receive DoD tuition assistance for the in-progress program, but they will be encouraged to enroll in courses provided by institutions that have entered into contracts with the DoD to provide programs at the applicable overseas duty location.\nFurthermore, the 2014 MOU and the related increased focus by the DoD on relationships and oversight of educational providers, or additional new DoD instructions or briefings, could lead to further changes in the nature of our relationships with military bases and educational service officers, which could be adverse in nature.\nOur business could be harmed if our institutions experience a disruption in their ability to process Title IV financial aid.\nWe collected a substantial portion of our fiscal year 2015 consolidated revenue from receipt of Title IV financial aid program funds. Any processing disruptions by ED, by our institutions, or by third-party service providers may impact the ability of our institutions\u2019 students to obtain Title IV financial aid on a timely basis. If our institutions experience a disruption in their ability to process Title IV financial aid, either because of administrative challenges on their part or the part of their vendors, or the inability of ED to process Title IV funds on a timely basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our institutions\u2019 business and on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have entered into, and may enter into or seek to enter into, business combinations and acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or divert management attention.\nOn November 1, 2013, we completed our acquisition of National Education Seminars, Inc., which we refer to as Hondros College of Nursing, or HCON. We may seek to enter into additional business combinations or acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties consolidating operations and integrating information technology and other systems, as well as the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from normal business operations during the acquisition and integration processes;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain, or delay in obtaining, approval of the acquisition from the necessary regulatory agencies, or the imposition of operating restrictions or a letter of credit requirement on us or on the acquired institution;\n\u2022\nchallenges relating to conforming non-compliant financial reporting procedures to those required of a subsidiary of a U.S. reporting company, including procedures required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u2022\nexpenses associated with the integration efforts; and\n\u2022\nunidentified issues not discovered in the due diligence process, including legal contingencies.\nAny inability to integrate completed acquisitions in an efficient and timely manner, including the HCON acquisition, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Further, acquisitions have resulted in us recording goodwill and may again in the future. If such acquisitions are not successful, our goodwill may become impaired, which would have an adverse\nimpact on our financial condition. In addition, our acquisition of an educational institution could be considered a change in ownership and control of the acquired institution under applicable regulatory standards, as in the HCON acquisition. For such an acquisition, we may need approval from ED, applicable state agencies and accrediting agencies, and possibly other regulatory bodies. Our inability to obtain such approvals with respect to a completed acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are not successful in completing acquisitions, we may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without a productive result. In addition, future acquisitions could result in dilutive issuances of securities or could require use of substantial portions of our available cash, as in the HCON acquisition, or issuances of debt, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have recently announced an organizational realignment, and challenges encountered due to the realignment may cause strategic or operational challenges and adversely impact us.\nOn December 14, 2015, APUS, issued a press release announcing that it had commenced a search for a new APUS president in connection with an anticipated organizational realignment. After the identification of his successor, APUS President and CEO Dr. Wallace E. Boston will focus on his position as CEO of American Public Education, Inc., or APEI, providing strategic and leadership support to APUS, HCON, and other APEI ventures. This transition, and the related anticipated organizational realignment, could, among other things, require a significant investment of capital and human resources and\nmay be costly and disruptive to our operations, and could impose substantial demands on the time of management. The transition and realignment may also require, among other things, changes in our systems, modification of internal control procedures and training of employees or third party resources. The impact of any strategic or operational challenges we face during or as a result of the transition and realignment could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have continued to experience increases in our institutions\u2019 administrative and infrastructure expenses, unpredictability in our institutions\u2019 enrollment and exposure to bad debt.\nAfter APUS began participating in Title IV programs, a significant portion of its growth was attributable to students using funds from those programs. As a result, APUS experienced a change in the composition of its student body, which has resulted, and will continue to result in a need to provide a greater level of services to its students. The HCON acquisition has further changed the composition of our student body, increasing the number of students using Title IV program funds, as well as adding students who attend courses at physical campuses. Our costs and expenses have increased due in part to increased general and administrative expenses related to these changes and primarily attributable to an increase in expenditures for financial aid processing, expenditures for technology required to support the increase in non-military students at APUS, and increased bad debt primarily associated with non-military students at APUS. In order to support the number of APUS students we now have, plan for the future, and provide the technology experience and access across a variety of platforms that we believe students and potential students have come to expect, we anticipate that we will continue to make significant investments in our technology infrastructure and financial aid processing capabilities.\nWhile bad debt for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased from the level of bad debt for the year ended December 31, 2014, over the past several years we have experienced an increase in our bad debt expense, particularly at APUS. We believe our historical increase in bad debt expense was primarily driven by a change in our student body at APUS, operational policies, processing challenges, and collections management. In September 2015, APUS changed the method by which it disburses Title IV program funds from a single disbursement method to a multiple disbursement method for first-time APUS undergraduate students. While this change may adversely impact enrollment, we are making this change in order to potentially lower bad debt expense and to reduce the attractiveness of our programs to students who are seeking to take improper advantage of the Title IV programs. We have no assurance that this change will be successful at reducing bad debt. If we are unable to make appropriate improvements, or if our improvements are not as effective as anticipated, our bad debt expense could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party vendors whose service may be of lower quality than ours, whose responsiveness may be less timely than ours, and whose compliance practices may increase our operational and compliance risk.\nWe rely on third-party vendors to provide certain services to our institutions and their students. While we monitor and assess the service of these vendors, it is possible that the quality of their service and the timeliness of their responses may be less than the service and responsiveness that we or our institutions would provide. These third-party vendors may lack adequate business continuity planning. Using third-party vendors increases compliance risk that the vendors may not adequately protect personal information regarding our institutions\u2019 students and their families, or that they may not comply with applicable federal or state regulations applicable to our institutions\u2019 businesses. Further, transitioning from existing vendors or from in-house processes to new providers involves inherent risks, including the risk of significant disruptions of integral processes. In the event\nthird-party vendors fail to provide services, lack adequate continuity planning, or fail to provide necessary implementation or transition services, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe encountered problems related to the software and services of a third-party vendor that we used to assist with APUS\u2019s financial aid processing, which could result in adverse regulatory actions and reputational problems and negatively affect our operating results, and we may experience risks and costs related to the transition of these services to a different third-party vendor.\nIn the beginning of the third quarter of 2013, APUS transitioned from using the services of a third-party servicer to assist with the administration and management of APUS\u2019s participation in Title IV programs to utilizing an internal solution that relies, in part, on software and services provided by a third-party vendor. We experienced unexpected delays in financial aid processing as a result of various software and programming errors and limitations, resulting in ED rejecting certain student records, an inability to disburse Title IV program funds to some students and other related issues. While we had anticipated that in connection with the transition there would be a delay in processing financial aid for a short period of time, the delays were longer than expected and there were more errors than expected. In addition, when the decision was made to move financial aid processing in-house using software supplied by a third-party vendor, we anticipated being able to automate certain manual processes. Errors in the software, as well as lack of experience with the software by many of our financial aid staff, required manual work outside the system, increasing the time to process Title IV program financial aid. APUS attempted to work with the vendor to identify the causes of the delays, errors and problems. Many were resolved, but some remained, and APUS had to perform manual work outside the automated system to process Title IV program financial aid. The challenges with the processing of Title IV program financial aid led to, or could lead to, further reputational problems, adverse effects on our operating results, reduced course enrollments, increased costs, and regulatory problems. In April 2015, APUS began to transition its financial aid processing to a third-party servicer, Global Financial Aid Services. APUS substantially completed the transition at the end of 2015. There were significant costs relating to the implementation of Global Financial Aid Services' financial aid processing services and there may be significant costs and risks related to the transition going forward. Further, future challenges encountered due to the previous third-party software vendor may divert management\u2019s attention, which could adversely impact our business.\nWe have described additional risks related to this situation, Title IV compliance, and the use of third-party servicers in these Risks Factors. Those risks and the issues explained in this risk factor may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nWe may have unanticipated tax liabilities that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe and our institutions are subject to multiple types of taxes in the U.S. and may be subject to taxation in the future in various foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax accruals involves various judgments, and therefore the ultimate tax determination is subject to uncertainty. In addition, changes in tax laws, regulations, or rules, or application of state sales taxes, may adversely affect our future reported financial results, may impact the way in which we conduct our business, or may increase the risk of audit by the Internal Revenue Service or other tax authorities. Although we believe our tax accruals are reasonable, the final determination of tax returns under review or returns that may be reviewed in the future and any related litigation could result in tax liabilities that materially differ from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In addition, an increasing number of states are adopting new laws or changing their interpretation of existing laws regarding the apportionment of service revenue for corporate income tax purposes in a manner that could result in a larger proportion of our income being taxed by the states in which we sell services. These legislative and administrative changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to fund acquisitions and certain investments.\nWe rely on dividends, distributions and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to fund acquisitions and certain investments. We conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries, and as of December 31, 2015, had no significant assets other than cash, the capital stock of our respective subsidiaries, and assets related to several investments. As a result, we rely on dividends and other payments or distributions from our operating subsidiaries to meet our obligations and to fund acquisitions and investments. The ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make distributions or other payments to us depends on their respective operating results and may be restricted by, among other things, the laws of their respective jurisdictions of organization, regulatory and accreditation requirements, agreements entered into by those operating subsidiaries, and the covenants of any future obligations that we or our subsidiaries may incur.\nHaving students physically present on HCON\u2019s campuses may result in threats to student safety and other issues.\nWe manage and monitor on-the-ground operations at four physical campuses where HCON students attend courses and participate in educational activities. The presence of students on physical campuses requires us to consider and respond to issues related to student safety, security, and violence. Failure to prevent, or adequately respond to, threats to student and employee safety or other problems could harm our reputation, causing enrollment and revenue to decline, or could result in costly and resource-intensive litigation.\nWe are subject to new regulatory requirements in connection with our operation of HCON\u2019s physical campuses. HCON must comply with the campus safety and security reporting requirements as well as other requirements in the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, or Clery Act, including changes made to the Clery Act by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, or VAWA. The Clery Act requires an institution to report to ED and disclose in its annual security report, for the three most recent calendar years, statistics concerning the number of certain crimes that occurred on or within the institution\u2019s so-called \u201cClery geography.\u201d On October 20, 2014, ED published a final rule implementing those statutory changes made to the Clery Act by VAWA. The final rule requires, among other things, that institutions maintain statistics about the number of incidents of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking that meet the definitions of those terms as set forth in the final rule; provide incoming students and new employees with, and describe in their annual security reports, their primary prevention and awareness programs; provide students and employees with, and describe in their annual security reports, their ongoing prevention and awareness campaigns; and provide a description in their annual security reports each type of disciplinary proceeding used by the institution, which must be prompt, fair, and impartial. The new regulations were effective July 1, 2015. Compliance with these new regulations could increase HCON\u2019s administrative costs, which would have a negative impact on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the Clery Act requirements or regulations promulgated by ED could result in action by ED to fine our institutions or to limit or suspend our institutions\u2019 participation in Title IV programs.\nNatural disasters or other extraordinary events may cause us to close one or more of HCON\u2019s campuses or may cause HCON\u2019s enrollment and revenue to decline.\nHCON may experience business interruptions resulting from natural disasters, inclement weather, transit disruptions or other events in one or more of the cities in Ohio in which it operates. These events could cause HCON to close campuses temporarily or permanently. Further, a regional or national outbreak of influenza or other illness easily spread by human contact could cause us to close one or more of HCON\u2019s campuses for an extended period of time. These events could affect student recruiting opportunities in those locations, causing enrollment and revenue to decline.\nWe have limited experience in making investments in other entities, and any such investments may not result in strategic benefits for our business or could expose us to other risks.\nTo assist us in achieving elements of our business strategy or to further develop our business capabilities, from time to time we will consider and may pursue strategic investments and acquisitions. These transactions could include, among other things, investments in, partnerships or joint ventures with, or the acquisition of other schools, service providers or education technology related companies, among other types of entities. Investing in another entity requires expertise in evaluating another entity\u2019s business and identifying strategic benefits of a potential investment in such entity, among other expertise. These types of investments involve significant challenges and risks, including that the investment does not advance our business strategy, that it has an adverse effect on our results of operations, that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, that we acquire unknown liabilities, or that management\u2019s attention is diverted from our core business. These events could harm our operating results or financial condition. Any investments in other entities may also subject us to the operating and financial risks of such entities, and we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of such entities.\nSince 2012, we have made minority investments in entities in which we do not have sole control, which present risks in addition to those that apply to other investments or acquisitions. These investments include our investment in a holding company that acquired and now operates New Horizons Worldwide, Inc., or New Horizons, our investment in preferred stock of Fidelis Education, Inc., or Fidelis Education, our investment in preferred stock of Second Avenue Software, Inc., or Second Avenue, and our investment in preferred stock of an online social networking company. Although we have the right to representation on the Board of Directors of the holding company of New Horizons, the Board of Directors of Fidelis Education, and the Board of Directors of Second Avenue, and have observer rights for the Board of Directors of the online social networking company, we do not have the ability to control the policies, management or affairs of these entities, and generally we would not have that ability in any minority investment in an entity. The interests of persons who control the entities in which we have invested and may invest may differ from our interests, and they may cause such entities to take actions that are not in our\nbest interest, and we may become involved in disputes with such persons. Our inability to control entities in which we make minority investments could negatively affect our ability to realize the strategic benefits of those investments.\nWe have made minority investments to realize strategic benefits for our business, rather than to generate income or capital gains from these investments, and we anticipate that we would make future minority investments for similar purposes. We cannot ensure that we will realize any strategic benefits from these investments in the near-term or at all. To the extent that the strategic benefits of any investment are not timely realized, or the investment otherwise underperforms, we may wish to dispose of the investment. Because our interests in entities in which we have made minority investments, such as New Horizons, Fidelis Education, Second Avenue, and the online social networking company are highly illiquid and not traded in any public market, we may not be able to timely dispose of these interests, or may have to sell at less than our carrying value. Further, should the value of these investments become impaired, we may be required to reduce the carrying value of these investments. Our inability to dispose of our interest in such an entity, or a reduction in the carrying value of such an entity on our books, would negatively affect our operating results.\nThe loss of any key member of our management team may impair our ability to operate effectively and may harm our business.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel. The loss of one or more of our key personnel could harm our business. While we have employment agreements with our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Boston, and each of our Executive Vice Presidents, we do not have employment agreements with other executives or personnel, and the employment agreements that we do have do not prevent our executives from voluntarily ceasing to work for us.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain management, faculty, administrators, and skilled personnel, our business and growth prospects could be severely harmed.\nWe must attract and retain highly qualified management, faculty, administrators, and skilled personnel to our institutions. Competition for hiring these individuals is intense, especially with regard to faculty in specialized areas, and executives with relevant industry expertise. Our institutions\u2019 past growth created constant demands to find qualified individuals across all levels, and we believe that we need to continue to expand and strengthen our management team to support the operations of our institutions. For instance, APUS has commenced a search for a new APUS president in connection with an anticipated organizational realignment. Once a new APUS president is identified and appointed, Dr. Wallace E. Boston, the current APUS president, will focus on his position as CEO of APEI, providing strategic leadership support to APUS, HCON and other APEI ventures. If we fail to attract new management, faculty, administrators, or skilled personnel or fail to retain and motivate our existing management, faculty, administrators, and skilled personnel, our institutions and our ability to serve our students and expand our programs could be severely harmed. ED\u2019s incentive payment rule may also affect the manner in which we attract, retain, and motivate new and existing employees, as described more fully below in \u201cRisks Related to the Regulation of our Industry.\u201d\nIf our institutions fail to maintain adequate systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent activity in student enrollment and financial aid, our institutions may lose the ability to participate in Title IV programs or Department of Defense tuition assistance programs, or have participation in these programs conditioned or limited.\nInstitutions offering online education, including APUS, have experienced fraudulent activity related to Title IV program funds. Grants and loans to students under Title IV programs are primarily awarded on the basis of financial need, generally defined as the difference between the cost of attending an institution and the amount a student can be expected to contribute to that cost. In order to account for living expenses and other costs that our students may reasonably incur in the context of pursuing a degree or certificate, the cost of attending each of our institutions is an amount that exceeds the cost of its tuition. While some students elect to receive grants and loans that cover only the cost of tuition and fees, others elect to receive amounts up to the full cost of attendance. When one of our institutions receives Title IV program funds on a student\u2019s behalf, it credits those funds to the student\u2019s account. If a student has elected to receive funds in excess of the cost of tuition and fees, a credit balance is generated, and the institution must pay that credit balance to the student unless the student has authorized the institution to hold the credit balance or take other permissible action with respect to the credit balance. The availability of Title IV program funds, including any credit balance payment, is an important part of enabling some students to pursue a degree or certificate. However, some individuals seek to take advantage of Title IV programs by enrolling for the purpose of obtaining funds they may receive directly through a credit balance payment. On September 26, 2011, ED\u2019s Inspector General released a report about an increasing number of cases involving large, loosely affiliated groups of individuals, so-called \u201cfraud rings\u201d, who conspire to defraud Title IV programs through enrollment in distance education programs. These fraud rings take advantage of the availability of credit balance payments under Title IV.\nOur institutions have been the target of fraudulent activity related to Title IV program funds, as well as other fraudulent activities, and growth at our institutions may make them more susceptible to an increased risk of such activities. The potential for outside parties to perpetrate fraud in connection with the award and disbursement of Title IV program funds at APUS, including as a result of identity theft, may be heightened due to its being an exclusively online education provider and its relatively low tuition. Our institutions must maintain systems and processes to identify and prevent fraudulent applications for enrollment and financial aid. We cannot be certain that our institutions\u2019 systems and processes will continue to be adequate in the face of increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes, or that we will be able to expand such systems and processes at a pace consistent with the changing nature of these fraud schemes.\nED requires institutions that participate in Title IV programs to refer to the ED Office of the Inspector General, or OIG, credible information about fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs, and in the past we have referred to the OIG information with respect to potential fraud by applicants and students. If the systems and processes that our institutions have established to detect and prevent fraud are inadequate, ED may find that our institutions do not satisfy ED\u2019s \u201cadministrative capability\u201d requirements. If our institutions fail to satisfy the administrative capability requirements, ED may require the repayment of Title IV program funds, transfer our institutions from the \u201cadvance\u201d system of payment of Title IV program funds to heightened cash monitoring status, or to the \u201creimbursement\u201d system of payment, place our institutions on provisional certification status, or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend, or terminate our institutions\u2019 participation in Title IV programs, which would limit our institutions\u2019 potential for growth and adversely affect our institutions\u2019 enrollment, revenue, and results of operations. In addition, our institutions\u2019 ability to participate in Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs is conditioned on maintaining accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the Secretary of Education. The significance of accreditation is described more fully above in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Accreditation.\u201d Any significant failure to adequately detect fraudulent activity related to student enrollment and financial aid could cause our institutions to fail to meet their accreditors\u2019 standards. Furthermore, under the Higher Education Opportunity Act, or HEOA, accrediting agencies that evaluate institutions offering online programs, like APUS\u2019s programs and HCON\u2019s online Registered Nurse to Bachelor of Science in Nursing completion program, must require such institutions to have processes through which the institution establishes that a student who registers for such a program is the same student who participates in and receives credit for the program. Failure to meet the standards of our institutions\u2019 accrediting agencies could result in the loss of accreditation of one or more of our institutions, which could result in their loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, DoD tuition assistance programs, or both.\nOur limited ability to obtain exclusive proprietary rights and protect our intellectual property, as well as disputes we may encounter from time to time with third parties regarding our use of their intellectual property, could harm our operations and prospects.\nIn the ordinary course of business, our institutions develop intellectual property of many kinds that is or will be the subject of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names, agreements, and other registrations. Our institutions rely on agreements under which we obtain rights to use course content developed by faculty members and other third-party content experts.\nWe cannot ensure that any measures we and our institutions take to protect our intellectual property or obtain rights to the intellectual property of others will be adequate, or that they have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate protections for all of our institutions\u2019 proprietary rights in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, or that third parties will not infringe upon or violate the proprietary rights of our institutions. Despite our efforts to protect these rights, third parties may attempt to develop competing programs or copy aspects of our institutions\u2019 curriculum, online resource material, quality management, and other proprietary content. Any such attempt, if successful, could adversely affect our institutions\u2019 business. Protecting these types of intellectual property rights can be difficult, particularly as it relates to the development by our institutions\u2019 competitors of competing courses and programs.\nOur institutions may encounter disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, and may not prevail in these disputes. Third parties may raise a claim against our institutions alleging an infringement or violation of their intellectual property. In July 2006, APUS settled a dispute with another institution regarding the use of certain marks that allowed us to continue to use the marks at issue, but we may not be able to favorably resolve future disputes. Some third-party intellectual property rights may be extremely broad, and it may not be possible for our institutions to conduct operations in such a way as to avoid disputes regarding those intellectual property rights. Any such dispute could subject our institutions to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether that dispute has merit. Our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and our institutions may be required to alter the content of their courses or pay monetary damages, which may be significant.\nWe may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of course materials posted online for course discussions.\nIn some instances, our institutions\u2019 faculty members or students may post various articles or other third-party content online in course discussion boards or in other venues. The laws governing the fair use of these third-party materials are imprecise and adjudicated on a case-by-case basis, which makes it challenging to adopt and implement appropriately balanced institutional policies governing these practices. We and our institutions may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of this material posted online. Third parties may raise claims against us and our institutions for the unauthorized duplication of this material. Any such claims could subject us and our institutions to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether the claims have merit. Our institutions\u2019 faculty members or students could also post classified material on course discussion boards, which could expose us to civil and criminal liability and harm our institutions\u2019 reputations and relationships with members of the military and government. Our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to pay monetary damages and our institutions may be required to alter the content of their courses.\nLegal proceedings, particularly class action lawsuits, may require human and financial resources, distract our management and negatively affect our reputation and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we and our institutions have been and may be involved in various legal proceedings. In recent years, we have observed an increase in litigation brought against for-profit schools, including class actions brought by students and prospective students based on alleged misrepresentations about a school\u2019s programs, and an increase in \u201cqui tam\u201d lawsuits, which are described below under the heading \u201cRisks Related to the Regulation of our Industry.\u201d For example, in November 2013, a putative class action was brought against HCON relating to a time period prior to our ownership. The lawsuit asserted claims for fraud and fraudulent inducement, negligent misrepresentation, breach of implied-in-fact contract, promissory estoppel, unjust enrichment, and violation of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, for, among other things, the alleged provision of false or misleading information to the named plaintiffs and other putative class members in 2011 and 2012 regarding the status of accreditation by National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission of HCON\u2019s Associate Degree in Nursing, or ADN, program offered at its Independence, Ohio campus. HCON and the named plaintiffs entered into a settlement agreement on November 19, 2014 under which the plaintiffs agreed to dismiss their case for a de minimis settlement payment. HCON admitted to no wrongdoing in the settlement agreement and the case was dismissed with prejudice. As part of ED's post-closing review of our acquisition of HCON, ED requested additional information related to the lawsuit. On December 4, 2015, ED sent HCON a letter informing HCON that ED had determined to fine HCON $27,500 based on ED\u2019s review of the submitted information and a finding that HCON had substantially misrepresented its programmatic accreditation status during a time period prior to our ownership of HCON. On December 18, 2015, HCON responded to ED in a letter in which it noted its disagreement with ED\u2019s findings, but informed ED of its decision to pay the fine in order to resolve promptly the matter and to enable ED to finalize its review of the application for a change in ownership. HCON paid the fine in December 2015. In the future, not all claims may be as easily resolved. The significant human and financial resources required to investigate and respond to claims brought in any future litigation may distract management\u2019s attention from operating our business or lead to larger payments or liabilities, including adverse regulatory action, and, as a result, negatively affect our operating results.\nChanges our institutions may make to their operations to enhance their ability to identify and enroll students who are likely to succeed and to improve the student experience may adversely affect our institutions\u2019 enrollment, growth rate, profitability, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn order to increase our institutions\u2019 focus on improving the learning experience and attracting students who are likely to persist in our institutions\u2019 programs, our institutions may implement changes and initiatives to more effectively admit college-ready students, support those students and help improve those student\u2019s educational outcomes, including through initiatives to increase the level of engagement and collaboration in the classroom. For example, in April 2015, APUS implemented an admissions process requiring prospective students to complete a free, non-credit admissions assessment if they are not (i) active duty military or veteran applicants; (ii) graduates of certified federal, state or local law enforcement or public safety academies; or (iii) students with at least nine hours of transfer credit from an accredited institution with a grade of \u201cC\u201d or better for each course. Additional initiatives may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nfurther changes to admissions standards and requirements;\n\u2022\naltering the admissions process and procedures;\n\u2022\nimplementing more stringent satisfactory academic progress standards;\n\u2022\nchanging tuition costs and payment options;\n\u2022\ntransitioning student facing services, including expanded use of the ClearPath system;\n\u2022\nexperimenting with competency-based learning and other alternative delivery methods; and\n\u2022\naltering our institutions\u2019 marketing programs to target the appropriate prospective students.\nThese initiatives may adversely impact our institutions\u2019 business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, particularly in the near term. These initiatives require significant time, energy, and resources, and involve many significant interrelated and simultaneous changes in our processes and programs. We may not succeed in achieving our objectives due to organizational, operational, regulatory, or other constraints. If our efforts are not successful, we may experience reduced enrollment, increased expense, or other impacts on our business that materially and adversely impact our operating results and financial condition.\nIncreases in tuition at APUS may adversely impact APUS's registrations, financial condition, results of operations and cash\nflows.\nAPUS implemented a tuition increase for all undergraduate and graduate course registrations made on or after July 1, 2015. To support APUS's active duty military and certain military-affiliated students, APUS is providing a tuition grant that maintains the cost of tuition for such students at approximately its previous level. APUS estimates that the tuition grant applies to approximately 75% of its total net course registrations. The full impact of the tuition increase is unknown and could result in fluctuations in APUS's registrations, including a decrease in registrations as a result of existing and future students seeking alternatives to enrolling at APUS, or those students registering for fewer courses. Declines in registrations would negatively impact enrollments, revenue and cash flow, and would adversely impact our financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe growth rate of our business is uncertain, and we may not be able to assess our future growth prospects effectively.\nThe growth rate of our business is uncertain, our business may not grow, and we may not be able to assess our future growth prospects effectively. Our ability to act on any growth model is dependent on a number of factors, including the success of our institutions, and the ability to obtain timely regulatory approvals, identify locations and market segments, and recruit and retain high-quality academic and administrative personnel. Due to a rapidly evolving industry, a challenging regulatory and government budget environment, and broader economic uncertainty, it has become more challenging to forecast our institutions\u2019 enrollments and consequently our financial results. These challenges may result in an inefficient deployment of resources, uncertainty in our financial results and volatility in our stock price, which may have an adverse effect on the return on an investment in our common stock.\nGrowth may require continued investment of capital, time, and resources, including to develop and update our institutions\u2019 technology, which may place a strain on resources that could adversely affect our systems, controls, and operating efficiency, and those of our institutions, and if we are unable to increase the capacity of our institutions\u2019 resources appropriately, our institutions\u2019 ability to handle future growth and to attract or retain students, and our financial condition and results of operations, could be adversely affected.\nThe growth we have experienced in the past, as well as any future growth that we may experience, could place a significant strain on our resources and the resources of our institutions and increase demands on our management information and reporting systems and financial management controls. We do not have experience scheduling courses and administering programs for more students than have been enrolled at our institutions, and if growth negatively impacts our ability to do so, the learning experience for students could be adversely affected, resulting in a higher rate of student attrition and fewer student referrals. We also have limited experience adding to our courses, programs, and operations through acquisitions. Prior to the acquisition of HCON, we had no experience operating physical campuses where students attend courses and otherwise participate in educational activities, and we have no experience opening new campus locations. Future growth will also require continued improvement of our internal controls and systems, particularly those related to complying with federal regulations under the Higher Education Act of 1965, or HEA, as administered by ED, including as a result of our institutions\u2019 participation in Title IV programs. We have described some of the most significant regulatory risks that apply to us and our institutions, including those related to Title IV programs, under the heading \u201cRisks Related to the Regulation of our Industry\u201d below. If we are unable to manage our growth or successfully carry out and integrate acquisitions, including the HCON integration, we may also experience operating inefficiencies that could increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability and results of operations.\nThe change in the composition of our student body has also made it harder for us to make forecasts about student enrollments. We have had more difficulty forecasting the number of students who will enroll and have noticed a decrease in the predictability of the rate at which we convert leads into enrolled students, which we attribute, in part, to increased competition, changes in our marketing approach, our new admissions assessment process, and our recent tuition increase, among other factors. If we are unable to adapt to changes in the composition of our student body and control the growth of related expenditures, we may experience operating inefficiencies that could increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability and\nresults of operations. Further, if we are unable to attract and retain qualified Title IV students, our financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nIf future growth requires an increase in the capacity and capabilities of our institutions\u2019 technology infrastructure, we will need to invest capital, time, and resources, which we expect from time to time will lead to increased spending on technology infrastructure, not all of which can be capitalized. There is no assurance that, even with sufficient investment, our systems will be scalable to accommodate future growth. We will also need to invest capital, time, and resources to update our institutions\u2019 technology in response to competitive pressures in the marketplace, including increased demands for interactive solutions and access from mobile platforms, as well as to allow for differential pricing, and we will have to make similar investments to integrate the technology systems of HCON and any other business we may acquire in the future. If we are unable to increase the capacity of our institutions\u2019 resources or update their resources appropriately, their ability to handle future growth and to attract or retain students, and our financial condition and results of operations, could be adversely affected. Similarly, even if we are able to increase the capacity of our institutions\u2019 resources and update their resources appropriately, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by an increased level of spending.\nWe may need additional capital in the future, but there is no assurance that funds will be available on acceptable terms.\nWe may need additional capital in the future for various reasons, including to finance business acquisitions and investments in technology or to achieve growth or fund other business initiatives, but there is no assurance that capital will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us and may be dilutive to existing stockholders. Additionally, any securities issued to raise capital may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If adequate capital is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, our and our institutions\u2019 ability to expand, develop or enhance services or products, or respond to competitive pressures, will be limited.\nOur access to capital markets and sourcing for additional funding to expand or operate our business may be adversely impacted by disruptions and volatility in the credit and equity markets worldwide and concerns regarding our industry in general and us in particular. The credit and equity markets of both mature and developing economies have experienced extraordinary volatility, asset erosion and uncertainty during the last several years. Until these market disruptions diminish, it may be more difficult to access the capital markets to obtain funding needed to expand our business by acquisition, organically, or otherwise. In addition, changes in the capital or other legal requirements applicable to lenders and investors may affect the availability or increase the cost of raising capital. Credit concerns regarding the proprietary postsecondary education industry as a whole also may impede our access to capital markets. If we are unable to obtain needed capital on terms acceptable to us, we may have to limit strategic initiatives or take other actions that materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business has been and may in the future be adversely affected by a general economic slowdown or recession in the U.S. or abroad.\nOur business has been and may in the future be adversely affected by a general economic slowdown or recession in the U.S. or abroad. In the recent past, the United States and other industrialized countries have experienced reduced economic activity, substantial uncertainty about their financial services markets and, in some cases, economic recession. We believe that these events negatively impacted our results during this time period and may continue to reduce the demand for our programs among students in the future, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. These adverse economic developments also may result in a reduction in the number of jobs available to our graduates and lower salaries being offered in connection with available employment, which, in turn, may result in declines in our placement and persistence rates. In addition, these events could adversely affect the ability or willingness of our former students to repay student loans, which could increase our institutions\u2019 student loan cohort default rates and require increased time, attention, and resources to manage these defaults. Our institutions\u2019 students are able to borrow Title IV loans in excess of their tuition and fees. The excess is received by such students as a credit balance refund. However, if a student withdraws, our institutions must return any unearned Title IV funds, which may include a portion of the credit balance refund, and must seek to collect from the student any resulting amounts owed to the institution. A protracted economic slowdown could negatively impact such students\u2019 ability to satisfy debts to the institution, including debts that result from returns of unearned Title IV amounts. As a result, the amount of Title IV funds we would have to return without repayment from our institutions\u2019 students could increase, and our financial results could suffer. Further, the impact of economic conditions abroad have not historically had a significant impact on our operations except to the extent they impact the U.S. economy, but should we increase our international enrollments the broader global economy will increasingly have an impact on our results.\nAn increase in interest rates could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain students.\nOur institutions derive a significant portion of their revenue from Title IV programs, which include student loans with interest rates subsidized by the federal government. Additionally, some students finance their education through private loans that are not government subsidized. If our students\u2019 employment circumstances are adversely affected by regional or national economic downturns, they may be more heavily dependent on student loans. Historically low interest rates have created a favorable borrowing environment for students. However, if interest rates increase or Congress decreases the amount of funding available for Title IV programs, our students may have to pay higher interest rates on their Title IV program loans and private loans. Any future increase in applicable interest rates could result in a corresponding increase in educational costs to our existing and prospective students, which could result in a reduction in our enrollment. Higher interest rates could also contribute to higher default rates with respect to our students\u2019 repayment of their education loans. Higher default rates may in turn adversely impact our eligibility to participate in some Title IV programs, which could adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nEfforts to diversify our business outside of the traditional areas served by our institutions may adversely impact our financial performance.\nAs we seek opportunities to expand our business and serve markets beyond those traditionally served by our institutions, we may encounter strategic and operational challenges different from those within our existing institutions. If we are unable to successfully capitalize on these opportunities, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nStrong competition in the postsecondary education market generally and in the military market could decrease our institutions\u2019 market share and increase our cost of acquiring students.\nWithin the postsecondary education market, our institutions compete primarily with not-for-profit public and private two-year and four-year colleges as well as other for-profit schools, particularly those that offer online learning programs. Public institutions receive substantial government subsidies, and public and private not-for-profit institutions have access to government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions, and other financial resources generally not available to for-profit schools. These institutions may have instructional and support resources that are superior to those of our institutions and other for-profit schools. Many of our competitors also have substantially greater name recognition and financial and other resources than we have, which may enable them to compete more effectively for potential students, or to provide instructional and support resources that are superior to those of our institutions and other for-profit schools. These institutions are increasingly differentiating themselves in the way that they deliver online course offerings, and we believe that in the future students seeking online instruction will be attracted to an institution in part because of the technology used by the institution to deliver instruction and other elements of the student experience. To compete for these students will require continued innovations and our people and technology platforms may not be capable of delivering competitive solutions that are desirable to students. In recent years, competing institutions and others have also started providing non-traditional, credit-bearing and non-credit-bearing education programs, including massively open online courses, or MOOCs, without charge or at low costs. Additionally, non-traditional competitors, such as entities offering coding bootcamps, are offering new alternative educational paths. We have also observed an increase in institutions offering competency-based programs, which permit students to progress in a program by demonstrating that they have achieved certain skills or knowledge rather than by earning credit hours, and ED has issued guidance addressing access to Title IV programs for students in these programs. We believe that our institutions will continue to face new competition from such programs, including competition from lower cost alternatives. Our institutions may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and may face competitive pressures that could adversely affect their business or results of operations. These competitive factors could cause our institutions\u2019 enrollments, revenue, and profitability to decrease significantly.\nWithin the postsecondary education market generally, we anticipate increased competition. The total postsecondary student population has been declining. According to the National Student Clearinghouse, enrollment in Title IV postsecondary degree-granting institutions in the fall of 2015 decreased 1.7%, compared to fall 2014, with a decrease of 13.7% taking place among four-year for-profit schools. Longer term projections suggest that previous growth in enrollment in postsecondary degree-granting institutions is slowing. According to a May 2015 report from ED, such enrollment was projected to grow 15% over the 11-year period ending in fall of 2023, compared to 24% growth over the 10-year period that ended in 2012. The combination of reduced growth or declines in the postsecondary student population and increased capacity in the postsecondary education market will further intensify competition.\nWe also anticipate that APUS will continue to see increased competition within the military market, which continues to be a primary market for APUS, including from for-profit schools as those schools seek to attract students eligible for DoD tuition assistance programs, VA education benefits, or both, at least in part as a strategy to satisfy a regulatory requirement of ED known as the 90/10 Rule. This regulatory requirement is described more fully in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing\nSources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - The \u201890/10 Rule.\u2019\u201d Public and private not-for-profit institutions are also providing increased competition, including commitments to participate in the VA Yellow Ribbon Program through which such institutions agree to make additional financial aid funds available to veterans receiving Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.\nBecause APUS provides exclusively online education, it is dependent on continued growth and acceptance of exclusively online education and, if the recognition by students and employers of the value of online education does not continue to grow, its ability to grow could be adversely impacted.\nWe believe that continued growth in online education will be largely dependent on additional students and employers recognizing the value of degrees earned online. Increasingly, employers demand that, in addition to technical or substantive skills, their new employees possess appropriate \u201csoft\u201d skills, such as communication, critical thinking, and teamwork skills, which can evolve rapidly in a changing economic and technological environment and may be, or may be perceived to be, more difficult to develop through online education. If students and employers are not convinced that online institutions are an acceptable alternative to traditional schools, or that an online education provides value, or if growth in the market penetration of online education slows, growth in the industry and at APUS could be adversely affected. Because our business model for APUS is based on exclusively online education, if the acceptance of online education does not grow, our ability to grow APUS\u2019s business and our financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIf our institutions are unable to update and expand the content of existing programs and develop new programs and specializations on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner, our future growth may be impaired.\nThe updates and expansions of our institutions\u2019 existing programs and the development of new programs and specializations may not be accepted by their accreditors, state regulators, ED, existing or prospective students, or employers. If we cannot respond to changes in market requirements, our business may be adversely affected. Even if our institutions are able to develop acceptable new programs, they may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as students require or as quickly as competitors introduce competing programs. To offer a new academic program, our institutions may be required to obtain appropriate federal, state, and accrediting agency approvals, which may be conditioned or delayed in a manner that could significantly affect our growth plans. If we are unable to respond adequately to changes in market requirements due to financial constraints, regulatory limitations, or other factors, our institutions\u2019 ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our financial results could suffer.\nEstablishing new academic programs or modifying or eliminating existing programs requires our institutions to make investments in management and capital expenditures, incur marketing expenses, and reallocate other resources. Our institutions may have limited experience providing courses in new fields of study and may need to modify systems and strategy or enter into arrangements with other institutions to provide new programs effectively and profitably. If our institutions are unable to increase the number of students enrolling in new academic programs, offer programs in a cost-effective manner, or otherwise manage effectively the operations of those programs, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAPUS may market its programs in international markets, which could subject us to a variety of risks not previously encountered and negatively impact our profitability and liquidity.\nAPUS may market its programs in international markets, which could subject us to a variety of risks not previously encountered and negatively impact our profitability and liquidity. We have marketed APUS's programs to a limited number of international students in the past and we may increase these efforts in the future. APUS may market its programs using foreign representatives and other methods. We do not have previous experience marketing APUS's programs through foreign representatives and we may be unable to adequately manage risks associated with these planned international efforts, which could adversely affect our ability to successfully attract, retain, and serve students in international markets and negatively impact our profitability and financial condition.\nThese international risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022uncertainty of acceptance of our offerings by students in international markets;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022challenges finding, managing, and retaining foreign representative relationships;\n\u2022compliance with foreign legal and regulatory requirements and unforeseen changes in such requirements;\n\u2022investment and execution missteps due to a failure to understand the local culture and market;\n\u2022political and economic instability in the countries in which we market;\n\u2022potential adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022compliance with certain U.S. laws and regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nIf we are unable to successfully pursue HCON\u2019s program initiatives and expansions, including opening new HCON campuses and increasing online education, our future growth may be impaired.\nThe success of HCON will depend on our ability to maintain and increase student enrollments in HCON\u2019s programs and grow HCON\u2019s on-campus and online program offerings. As part of our strategy, we intend to open new campuses for HCON. Such actions require us to obtain appropriate federal, state and accrediting agency approvals. In addition, adding new locations may require significant financial investments, human resource capabilities, and new clinical placement relationships. If we are unable to, or suffer any delay in our ability to, obtain appropriate approvals, attract additional students to new campus locations, offer programs at new campuses in a cost-effective manner, identify appropriate clinical placements, or otherwise manage effectively the operations of newly established campuses, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. At this time, because HCON is certified to participate in the Title IV programs on a provisional basis based on the change in ownership and control of HCON that resulted from our acquisition of it, HCON must apply to ED and wait for approval before it can award and disburse Title IV program funds to students enrolled at new HCON locations at which HCON offers 50% or more of an eligible program, or before it can award Title IV program funds to students enrolled in new degree or certificate programs.\nOutside Ohio, other states\u2019 regulatory bodies have regulations that apply to HCON programs. For example, a number of states may require that we obtain additional authorizations for HCON students enrolled in the online Registered Nurse to Bachelor of Science in Nursing completion program to participate in practicum courses in those states, even where HCON has no other physical presence in the state. These types of provisions may make it more difficult to offer online education programs in those states. The inability to expand efficiently or successfully existing programs and pursue new program initiatives would harm our ability to grow the business and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nIf our institutions do not have adequate continued personal referrals and marketing and advertising programs that are effective in developing awareness, attracting, and retaining qualified students, our financial performance in the future would suffer.\nBuilding awareness of our institutions and the programs they offer among potential students is critical to our institutions\u2019 ability to attract new students. In order to maintain and increase our revenue and profits, our institutions must continue to attract new, qualified students in a cost-effective manner, and these students must remain active in our institutions\u2019 programs. In addition, because our institutions experience declines in their student population as a result of graduation, transfers to other academic institutions, military deployments and other reasons, in order to grow we need to first attract sufficient students to replace those who have left. Our marketing strategy for APUS has traditionally focused on building long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with organizations and individuals in the military and public safety communities. APUS has supplemented its relationship-based marketing with multi-faceted interactive marketing campaigns to create a greater brand awareness, particularly of our APU brand outside the military and public safety communities, and to increase inquiries from potential students. Similarly, HCON\u2019s marketing strategy has focused on building long-term relationships with businesses, organizations, and individuals in the healthcare community, primarily in Ohio, where HCON\u2019s campuses are located. In addition, HCON utilizes traditional media as well as internet-focused marketing channels, including organic search, local display advertising and pay-per-click.\nSome of the factors that could prevent us from successfully advertising and marketing our institutions\u2019 programs and from successfully enrolling and retaining qualified students in those programs include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe emergence of more, and more successful, competitors;\n\u2022\nfactors related to our institutions\u2019 marketing, including the costs of internet advertising and multi-faceted interactive marketing campaigns;\n\u2022\nchallenges in designing marketing campaigns that successfully attract college-ready students;\n\u2022\nlimits on our ability to attract and retain effective employees because of the incentive payment rule, as described more fully below in \u201cRisks Related to the Regulation of our Industry;\u201d\n\u2022\nperformance problems with our institutions\u2019 online systems;\n\u2022\nour institutions\u2019 failure to maintain accreditation, state authorization, eligibility for Title IV programs, or other approvals;\n\u2022\nincreased regulation of online education, including in states in which we do not have a physical presence;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations or litigation that may damage our reputation;\n\u2022\nstudent dissatisfaction with our institutions\u2019 services and programs;\n\u2022\nfailure to develop and deliver a message or image for APUS that resonates well with non-military students;\n\u2022\na dilution of our brand as a result of the HCON acquisition or other expansion;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity regarding us, our institutions, our competitors, or online or for-profit education generally;\n\u2022\nadverse developments in APUS\u2019s relationships with military officers and other leaders in the military community;\n\u2022\ninability to integrate the HCON acquisition in an efficient and timely manner;\n\u2022\na decline in the acceptance of online education generally; and\n\u2022\na decrease in the perceived or actual economic benefits that students derive from our institutions\u2019 programs or programs provided by for-profit schools generally.\nTo continue to grow and diversify the student body of APUS, we will need to identify marketing channels that support that growth and diversification while also attracting students who perform well at APUS upon enrollment. However, because our tuition is generally lower than that of most of our competitors, we have fewer dollars available to spend on marketing and advertising than they do. As a result, we may decide to implement new marketing tactics and channels with which we have no experience and which have no guarantee of success. Accordingly, we may find it increasingly difficult to continue to compete and diversify our enrollments at APUS. If we are unable to continue to develop awareness of our institutions and the programs we offer, and to enroll and retain qualified students in military and non-military markets, our enrollments would suffer and our ability to increase revenue and maintain profitability would be significantly impaired.\nThe success of HCON depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and increase student enrollments in HCON\u2019s programs. Prior to the HCON acquisition, we had no experience with attracting new students to, and retaining students in, educational programs offered primarily on physical campuses. If we are unable to effectively market such programs, we may not be able to successfully execute our long-term strategic plan to diversify our business and expand our programs, which would negatively affect our operating results.\nSystem disruptions and security breaches to our online computer networks, technology infrastructure, or online classroom infrastructure, or to the networks, infrastructure and systems of third parties, could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue and could damage our reputation, limiting our ability to attract and retain students.\nThe performance and reliability of our and our institutions\u2019 networks and technology infrastructure, including those of third parties systems we use, is critical to our institutions\u2019 reputation and ability to attract and retain students. Any system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in bandwidth usage, could interrupt our or our institutions\u2019 ability to operate and could result in the unavailability of our institutions\u2019 online classrooms (which is particularly relevant to APUS), preventing students from accessing their courses and adversely affecting our results of operations.\nOur systems at APUS, particularly those proprietary information systems and processes that we refer to as PAD, have been predominantly developed in-house, with limited support from outside vendors. To the extent that we have utilized third-party vendors to provide certain software products for our systems, we have generally needed to integrate those products into, and ensure that they function with, PAD. We continuously work on upgrades to PAD, and our employees devote substantial time to its development and to the successful integration of third-party products into PAD. To the extent that we face system disruptions or malfunctions with PAD, we may not have the capacity to address such disruptions or malfunctions with our internal resources, and we may not be able to identify outside contractors with expertise relevant to our custom system.\nOur institutions\u2019 technology infrastructure, and the technology infrastructure of our third-parties vendors, could be vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, cyber attacks, hacker or terrorist activities, and telecommunications failures. Our computer networks, and the networks of our third-party vendors, may also be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, and other security problems. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or personal information about our students or employees, or could cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations. If we or third parties with access to our systems, or to our proprietary information or personal information about our students or employees, experience security breaches in the future, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches, which could include litigation from our students or employees or the impositions of penalties.\nWe perform security assessments on a periodic basis to review and assess our security. We utilize this information to audit ourselves to ensure that we are adequately monitoring the security of our technology infrastructure. However, we cannot ensure that these security assessments and audits will protect our computer networks against the threat of security breaches. Similarly, although we require our third-party vendors to maintain a level of security that is acceptable to us and work closely\nwith our third-party vendors to address potential and actual security concerns and attacks, we cannot ensure that we and our systems and proprietary information or personal information about our students or employees will be protected against the threat of security attacks on our third-party vendors that affect our systems or such information. System disruptions and security breaches to our online computer networks, technology infrastructure, or online classroom infrastructure, or to the networks, infrastructures and systems of third parties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe personal information that we collect may be vulnerable to breach, theft or loss that could adversely affect our reputation and operations.\nPossession and use of personal information in our institutions\u2019 operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business. Our institutions may collect, use, and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our students and their families, including social security numbers, tax return information, personal and family financial data, bank account information, and credit card numbers. Our institutions also collect and maintain personal information of employees in the ordinary course of our business. Some of this personal information is held and managed by certain third-party vendors, including our third-party servicers and information technology vendors. Although our institutions use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information, a third party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, which could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. In addition, errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. Possession and use of personal information in our institutions\u2019 operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could restrict the use of personal information and require notification of data breaches. We cannot guarantee that a breach, loss or theft of personal information will not occur. A violation of any laws or regulations relating to the collection or use of personal information could result in the imposition of fines or lawsuits against us or our institutions. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. A breach, theft, or loss of personal information regarding our institutions\u2019 students and their families or our institutions\u2019 employees that is held by our institutions or third-party vendors could have a material adverse effect on our institutions\u2019 reputations and results of operations and result in liability under foreign, state and federal privacy statutes and legal actions by state attorneys general and private litigants, any of which could divert management\u2019s attention and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe face an ever increasing number of threats to our computer systems, including unauthorized activity and access, malicious penetration, system viruses, malicious code and organized cyber-attacks, which could breach our security and disrupt our systems. These risks increase when we make changes to our information technology systems or implement new ones. Our size makes us a prominent target for hacking and other cyber attacks within the education industry. From time to time we experience security events and incidents, and these reflect an increasing level of malicious sophistication, organization, and innovation. We have devoted and will continue to devote significant resources to the security of our computer systems, but they may still be vulnerable to these threats. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations, perhaps over an extended period of time prior to detection. As a result, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of or alleviate problems caused by these system disruptions and security breaches. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Although we maintain insurance in respect of these types of events, there is no assurance that available insurance proceeds would be adequate to compensate us for damages sustained due to these events.\nFailure to comply with privacy laws or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business.\nVarious federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data. This area of the law is evolving, and interpretations of applicable laws and regulations differ. Legislative activity in the privacy area may result in new laws that are relevant to us and the operations of our institutions, for example, use of consumer data for marketing or advertising. Claims of failure to comply with our institutions\u2019 privacy policies or applicable laws or regulations could form the basis of governmental or private-party actions against us. Such claims and actions may cause damage to our institutions\u2019 reputation and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nAny significant interruption in the operation of data centers hosting our institutions\u2019 technology infrastructure could cause a loss of data and disrupt the ability to manage our institutions\u2019 technology infrastructure.\nAny significant interruption in the operation of our institutions\u2019 data centers or server rooms could cause a loss of data and disrupt the ability to manage network hardware and software and technological infrastructure. Even with redundancy, a significant interruption in the operation of these facilities or the loss of institutional and operational data due to a natural disaster, fire, power interruption, act of terrorism or other unanticipated catastrophic event may not be preventable. Any significant interruption in the operation of these facilities, including an interruption caused by the failure to successfully expand or upgrade\nsystems or manage transitions and implementations, could reduce the ability to manage network and technological infrastructure, which could adversely affect our institutions\u2019 operations and reputations. Additionally, our institutions do not necessarily control the operation of the facilities hosting our technology infrastructure and may be required to rely on other parties to provide physical security, facilities management and communications infrastructure services. If any third-party vendors encounter financial difficulty such as bankruptcy or other events beyond our control that causes them to fail to adequately secure and maintain their facilities or provide necessary data communications capacity, our institutions\u2019 students may experience interruptions in service or the loss or theft of important data, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nGovernment regulations relating to the internet could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to grow.\nGovernment regulations relating to the internet could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to grow. The increasing reliance on and use of the internet and other online services has led and may continue to lead to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the United States or foreign countries and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. These new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as online privacy, internet neutrality, copyrights, trademarks and service marks, sales taxes, fair business practices, and the requirement that online education institutions qualify to do business as foreign corporations or be licensed in one or more jurisdictions where they have no physical location. New laws, regulations or interpretations related to doing business over the internet could increase our costs of compliance or doing business and materially affect our institutions\u2019 ability to offer online courses, which would have a material effect on our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Regulation of Our Industry\nIf we or our institutions fail to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for the operation of postsecondary education institutions, we and our institutions could face penalties and significant restrictions on operations, including loss of access to DoD tuition assistance programs and federal student loans and grants.\nWe and our institutions are subject to extensive regulation by (i) accrediting agencies recognized by the U.S. Secretary of Education, (ii) state regulatory bodies, and (iii) the federal government, through ED. Because APUS participates in DoD tuition assistance and VA education benefits programs administered by DoD and the VA, respectively, and HCON participates in VA benefit programs, they are also subject to oversight by those agencies. The regulations, standards, and policies of these organizations cover the vast majority of our institutions\u2019 operations, including their educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, and financial condition. These regulatory requirements can also affect the ability to acquire new institutions, to open new locations, to add new or expand existing educational programs, to change our corporate structure or ownership, and to make other substantive changes. These requirements can also increase our cost of operations.\nFindings of noncompliance with these laws, regulations, standards, and policies could result in any of the relevant regulatory agencies taking action including: imposing monetary fines, penalties, or injunctions; limiting operations, including restricting our institutions\u2019 ability to offer new programs of study or to open new locations, or imposing limits on our growth; limiting or terminating our ability to grant degrees; restricting or revoking our institutions\u2019 accreditation, licensure, or other approval to operate; limiting, suspending, or terminating our institutions\u2019 eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, DoD tuition assistance programs, or other financial aid programs by requiring us to repay funds, post a letter of credit, become subject to payment methods for Title IV programs that are not the advance payment system; subjecting us to civil or criminal penalties; or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe regulations, standards, and policies of ED, state regulatory bodies, and our institutions\u2019 accrediting agencies change frequently and are subject to interpretive ambiguities, particularly where they are written for institutions that offer on-campus instruction, such as HCON, rather than online institutions, such as APUS. Recent and pending changes in, or new interpretations of, applicable laws, regulations, standards, or policies, or our noncompliance with any applicable laws, regulations, standards, or policies, could have a material adverse effect on our accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, receipt of funds under DoD tuition assistance programs, our ability to participate in Title IV programs, our ability to participate in VA education benefit programs, or costs of doing business. We cannot predict with certainty how all of these regulatory requirements will be applied or whether we will be able to comply, or will be deemed by others to have complied, with all of the requirements. In the section entitled \u201cRegulatory Environment\u201d of this Annual Report and these Risk Factors, we have described some of the more significant risks related to the ability of our institutions to comply with the regulations, standards, and policies of ED, state regulatory bodies, and our accrediting agencies.\nIn addition, in some circumstances of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance, we may be subject to \u201cqui tam\u201d lawsuits under the Federal False Claims Act or various, similar, state false claim statutes, and various \u201cwhistleblower\u201d statutes. In Federal\nFalse Claims Act actions, private plaintiffs seek to enforce remedies under the Federal False Claims Act on behalf of the U.S. government and, if successful, are entitled to recover their costs and to receive a portion of any amounts recovered by the U.S. government in the lawsuit. A similar process applies to state false claim statutes. These lawsuits can be prosecuted by a private plaintiff in respect of some action taken by us, even if ED or another regulatory body does not agree with the plaintiff\u2019s theory of liability, or the government can intervene and become a party to the lawsuit. Qui tam lawsuits have the potential to generate very significant damages linked to our receipt of government funds, including Title IV funding and DoD tuition assistance funds.\nIf our institutions fail to maintain their institutional accreditation, they would lose the ability to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs and also to participate in Title IV programs.\nAs described more fully above in each operating segment\u2019s section in \u201cOur Institutions - Accreditation\u201d and \u201cRegulatory Environment - Accreditation,\u201d each of our institutions is accredited by an institutional accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary of Education. Accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the Secretary of Education is required for participation in DoD tuition assistance programs and for an institution to become and remain eligible to participate in Title IV programs. APUS participates in DoD tuition assistance programs and Title IV programs, and HCON participates in Title IV programs.\nOur institutions\u2019 accrediting agencies may impose restrictions on their accreditation or may terminate their accreditation. To remain accredited, our institutions must continuously meet certain criteria and standards relating to, among other things, performance, governance, institutional integrity, educational quality, faculty, administrative capability, resources, and financial stability. Failure to meet any of these criteria or standards could result in the loss of accreditation at the discretion of the accrediting agencies. The complete loss of accreditation would, among other things, render our institutions and their students ineligible to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs and Title IV programs, and have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenue, and results of operations.\nOur institutions\u2019 student enrollments could decline if they fail to maintain accreditation.\nInstitutional accreditation is an important attribute of our institutions. Colleges and universities depend, in part, on accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools; some institutions will accept transfer credit only from regionally accredited institutions. Employers rely on the accredited status of institutions when evaluating a candidate\u2019s credentials, and students, corporations, and government sponsors under tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards. Failure to maintain our institutional accreditation would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenue, and results of operations. In addition, certain of our individual programs are accredited by specialized accrediting agencies, or recognized by professional organizations. If we fail to satisfy the standards of these specialized accrediting agencies and professional organizations, we could lose the specialized accreditation or professional recognition for the affected programs, which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs and have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, in certain cases, professional licensure will not be granted if an applicant for licensure earned the relevant educational credential from an institution or educational program that lacks regional or specialized accreditation. Failure to obtain or maintain specialized accreditation or professional recognition for certain programs could result in materially reduced student enrollments in affected programs and have a material adverse effect on us.\nIncreased scrutiny of accrediting agencies by the Secretary of Education and the U.S. Congress may result in increased scrutiny of institutions, particularly for-profit institutions, by accrediting agencies, and if the accrediting agency of one of our institutions were to lose its ability to serve as an accrediting agency for Title IV program purposes, that institution may lose its ability to participate in Title IV programs.\nAPUS is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, or HLC. In December 2009, the ED Office of the Inspector General, or OIG, recommended that ED consider limiting, suspending, or terminating HLC\u2019s recognition as an accreditor for purposes of determining institutional eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. HLC received additional scrutiny in June 2010 during a House Education and Labor Committee hearing focused on OIG\u2019s findings with regard to credit hour policies. Increased scrutiny of accrediting agencies by the Secretary of Education and Congress in connection with ED\u2019s recognition process may result in increased scrutiny of institutions by accrediting agencies.\nIn December 2010, the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity, or NACIQI, the panel charged with advising ED on whether to recognize accrediting agencies for Title IV purposes, reviewed HLC\u2019s status as a recognized accrediting agency. At that time, NACIQI voted to continue HLC\u2019s recognition as an accrediting agency but also ordered the agency to submit an additional compliance report in one year. At its December 2011 meeting, NACIQI characterized\nHLC\u2019s report as \u201cinformational\u201d and noted that no vote was to be taken on it. In June 2013, NACIQI voted to recommend continuation of HLC\u2019s recognition as an accrediting agency until it reaches a final decision on whether to re-recognize HLC. In June 2015, NACIQI voted to recommend that ED renew HLC\u2019s recognition as an accrediting agency through December 2017. ED subsequently accepted NACIQI\u2019s recommendation and continued HLC\u2019s recognition through December 2017. We cannot predict whether NACIQI will recommend renewing HLC\u2019s recognition beyond December 2017. If HLC were to lose its recognition as an accrediting agency, APUS would lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs.\nHCON is accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, or ACICS. In June 2011, NACIQI reviewed ACICS\u2019s status as a recognized accrediting agency. At that time, NACIQI voted to continue ACICS\u2019s recognition as an accrediting agency but also ordered the agency to bring itself into compliance and submit within one year a report demonstrating its efforts to address concerns related to, among other things, the agency\u2019s experience in accrediting doctoral programs, the composition of its review teams and decision-making bodies, access to institutional files, and review and monitoring of student achievement, and reporting of the results to the institution. In June 2013, upon review of the compliance report submitted by ACICS, NACIQI voted to renew ACICS\u2019s recognition for a period of three years.\nIf ED ceased to recognize one of our institutional accrediting agencies for any reason, the institution accredited by that agency would not be eligible to participate in Title IV programs or the DoD tuition assistance programs, unless the institution was accredited by another accrediting agency recognized by ED, or ED continued to certify the eligibility of the institution to participate in Title IV programs. ED may continue to certify an institution for a period no longer than 18 months after the date such recognition ceases. The ineligibility of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs would have a material adverse effect on enrollments, revenue, and results of operations.\nNational or regional accreditation agencies may prescribe more rigorous accreditation standards for our institutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our student enrollment, revenue and cash flows.\nThe accreditation standards of the national or regional accreditation agencies that accredit our institutions can and do vary, and the accreditation agencies may prescribe more rigorous standards than are currently in place. Complying with more rigorous accreditation standards could require significant changes to the way we operate our business and increase our administrative and other costs. No assurances can be given that our institutions would be able to comply with more rigorous accreditation standards in a timely manner or at all. If one of our institutions does not meet its accreditation requirements, its accreditation could be limited, modified, suspended, or terminated. Failure to maintain accreditation would make such institution ineligible to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs and Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on the institution\u2019s student enrollment and revenue.\nBecause of rapid growth in, and increased scrutiny of, the for-profit education sector, accrediting bodies may adopt new or revised criteria, standards, and policies that are intended to monitor, regulate, or limit the growth of for-profit institutions like ours. For example, in June 2009, HLC adopted new policies related to institutional control, structure, and organization. The policies extend HLC\u2019s oversight to transactions that change, or have the potential to change, the control of an institution or its fundamental structure and organization. Under the policies, HLC extends its oversight to defined changes that occur in a parent or controlling entity, and not necessarily in the institution itself. Actions by, or relating to, an accredited institution, including a significant acquisition of another institution, significant changes in board composition or organizational documents, and accumulations by one stockholder of greater than 25% of the capital stock, could result in additional reviews by HLC and possible change from an accredited status to candidate status, which enhances the risks associated with these types of actions. In particular, the change from accredited status to candidate status could adversely impact an institution\u2019s ability to participate in Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs. For-profit institutions may also be less attractive acquisition candidates because HLC has enhanced its scrutiny of change in control transactions, obtained the explicit ability to move an institution from accredited status to candidate status, and will be examining more closely entities that own accredited institutions.\nBeginning in 2012, ACICS, HCON\u2019s accreditor, established compliance standards to measure student retention, graduate placement and licensure passage rates. In the event that a campus or program offered by a campus fails to meet the minimum compliance standard for two consecutive years after notice from ACICS and does not satisfy the requirement for a waiver, ACICS may withdraw accreditation from the campus or program. The compliance standards for retention and graduate placement increased substantially from 2012 to 2013. If one of the HCON campuses fails to meet the compliance standards for either student retention or graduate placement, enrollment in such HCON campuses programs could decline, which could have a material adverse impact on HCON\u2019s student enrollment, revenue, and cash flows.\nIf our institutions fail to maintain state authorization in the states where they are physically located, the institutions would lose their ability to grant degrees and other credentials in that state and to participate in Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs.\nAs discussed in the \u201cRegulatory Environment - State Licensure/Authorization\u201d section of this Annual Report, to participate in Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs, an institution must be legally authorized by the relevant education agency of the state in which it is physically located. Loss of state authorization by one of our institutions in the state in which it is physically located would cause that institution to be ineligible to participate in Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs and lose its ability to grant credentials.\nAPUS is physically headquartered in the State of West Virginia and is currently authorized to offer its programs by the West Virginia Higher Education Policy Commission, or WVHEPC, the regulatory agency governing postsecondary education in the State of West Virginia. Such authorization may be lost, limited or withdrawn if APUS fails to comply with material requirements under West Virginia statutes and rules for continued authorization. Under current law, if APUS were to lose its regional accreditation by HLC, WVHEPC may suspend, withdraw, or revoke APUS\u2019s authorization. In addition, in order to maintain our eligibility for accreditation by HLC, we must remain headquartered and have a substantial presence in one of the states in its region, which includes West Virginia. Thus, if APUS were to lose its authorization from WVHEPC, APUS would be unable to provide educational services in West Virginia, APUS would lose its eligibility for Title IV programs and DoD tuition assistance programs, and APUS would lose its HLC accreditation.\nHCON is located in the State of Ohio and is authorized by the Ohio State Board of Career Colleges and Schools and the Ohio Department of Higher Education. Such authorization may be limited, suspended, or revoked if HCON fails to submit renewal applications or other required submissions to the state in a timely manner, or if HCON fails to comply with material requirements under applicable Ohio statutes and rules for continued authorization. Continued state authorization is required in order to maintain ACICS accreditation. If HCON were to lose its authorization from the Ohio State Board of Career Colleges and Schools, HCON would be unable to provide educational services in Ohio, HCON would lose its eligibility for Title IV programs, and HCON would lose its accreditation. If HCON were to lose its authorization from the Ohio Department of Higher Education, HCON would be unable to offer the online Registered Nurse to Bachelor of Science in Nursing completion program in Ohio. If HCON were to lose approval from the Ohio Board of Nursing for the Diploma in Practical Nursing or the Associate Degree in Nursing, students in the program lacking approval would not be eligible to apply for licensure by examination to practice nursing in Ohio.\nEffective July 1, 2011, ED regulations provide that an institution is considered legally authorized by a state if the state has a process to review and appropriately act on complaints concerning the institution, including enforcing applicable state laws, and the institution complies with any applicable state approval or licensure requirements consistent with the new rules. If a state in which one of our institutions is located fails to comply in the future with the provisions of that regulation, our institutions\u2019 ability to operate in that state and to participate in Title IV programs could be limited or terminated. For additional information on these regulations please refer to the \u201cRegulatory Environment - ED\u2019s State Licensure/Authorization Regulatory Requirements\u201d section of this Annual Report.\nOur institutions\u2019 failure to comply with regulations of various states could result in actions taken by those states that would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenue, and results of operations.\nVarious states impose regulatory requirements on educational institutions operating within their boundaries. Many states assert jurisdiction over online educational institutions that have no physical location or other presence in the state but offer educational services to students who reside in the state or advertise to or recruit prospective students in the state. State regulatory requirements for online education are inconsistent among states and not well developed in many jurisdictions. As such, these requirements change frequently and, in some instances, are not clear or are left to the discretion of state regulators.\nFor information about those jurisdictions in which APUS and HCON are authorized, see \u201cRegulatory Environment - State Licensure/Authorization\u201d in this Annual Report. To the extent that we have obtained, or obtain in the future, state authorizations or licensure, changes in state laws and regulations and the interpretation of those laws and regulations by the applicable regulators may limit our ability to offer educational programs and award degrees. Some states may also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of ED. If we fail to comply with state licensing or authorization requirements to provide distance education in that state, we may be subject to the loss of state licensure or authorization to provide distance education in that state. If we fail to comply with state requirements to obtain licensure or authorization, we may be the subject of injunctive actions or penalties.\nAs described in the \u201cRegulatory Environment - State Licensure/Authorization\u201d section of this Annual Report, ED\u2019s Program Integrity Regulations provided that if an institution offered postsecondary education through distance education to students in a state, it was required to obtain any necessary approvals to do so. However, on June 5, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia affirmed the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia\u2019s July 12, 2011, ruling upholding ED\u2019s power to promulgate regulations on state authorization for distance education but vacating on procedural grounds those provisions of the Program Integrity Regulations. In November 2013, ED announced its intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking panel to consider regulations for, among other issues, state authorization of programs offered through distance education. Negotiated rulemaking sessions occurred in the winter and spring of 2014, but the negotiating committee did not reach consensus. In June 2014, ED announced that it would delay the release of proposed rules regarding state authorization for distance education. No assurance can be given with respect to whether ED will adopt new rules on state authorization for distance education or, in the event that such regulations are adopted, our ability to comply with the new regulations. Should ED adopt new rules addressing licensing requirements for distance education, and if one of our institutions fails to obtain or maintain required state authorization to provide postsecondary distance education in a specific state, the institution could lose its ability to award Title IV aid to students in that state and could lose its ability to provide distance education in that state.\nThe inability of our institutions\u2019 graduates to obtain professional licensure, employment or other outcomes in their chosen fields of study could reduce our enrollments and revenue, and potentially lead to litigation that could be costly to us.\nCertain of our institutions\u2019 graduates seek professional licensure, employment or other outcomes in their chosen fields following graduation. Their success in obtaining these outcomes depends on several factors, including, for example, the individual merits of the graduate; whether the institution and the program were approved by the state in which the graduate seeks licensure, or by a professional association; whether the program from which the student graduated meets all state requirements for professional licensure; and whether the institution or program has any required accreditation. Certain states have refused to license or certify students from particular APUS programs on grounds that the program did not meet one or more of the state\u2019s specific licensure requirements or was not approved by the state for purposes of professional licensure. Based on challenges related to satisfying varying state rules regarding eligibility for teacher licensure in a state, APUS determined not to enroll new students in any of its initial teacher licensure programs as of December 2014.\nTo apply for licensure to practice nursing in Ohio, an applicant must have successfully completed a nursing education program that is approved by the Ohio Board of Nursing. Regulations of the Ohio Board of Nursing, which approves the HCON Practical Nurse, or PN program, and Associates Degree in Nursing, or ADN programs, require that a nursing education program such as the HCON PN and ADN programs must have a pass rate on the relevant NCLEX licensure exam that is at least ninety-five percent of the national average for first-time candidates in a calendar year. If a program does not attain such pass rate, the program may face sanctions, including, after four consecutive years of failing to meet that standard, placement on provisional approval status. If a program on provisional approval continues to fail to meet the requirements, the Ohio Board of Nursing may withdraw its approval of the program.\nThe state requirements for licensure are subject to change, as are the professional certification standards, and we may not become aware of changes that may impact our students in certain instances. In addition, requirements for employment vary from employer to employer and from field to field. In the event that one or more states refuse to recognize our institutions\u2019 students for professional licensure based on factors relating to our institutions or programs, the potential growth of our institutions\u2019 programs would be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, to the extent our graduates fail to satisfy requirements for employment by particular employers or in a particular profession based on characteristics of our programs, the potential growth of our institutions\u2019 programs would be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we and our institutions could be exposed to litigation that would force us to incur legal and other expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur institutions must periodically seek recertification to participate in Title IV programs, and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to review by the Department of Education prior to seeking recertification, and our future success may be adversely affected if our institutions are unable to successfully maintain certification or obtain recertification.\nAn institution generally must seek recertification from ED at least every six years and possibly more frequently depending on various factors, such as whether it is provisionally certified. ED may also review an institution\u2019s continued eligibility and certification to participate in Title IV programs, or scope of eligibility and certification, in the event the institution undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change of control, or expands its activities in certain ways, such as the addition of certain types of new programs, addition of new locations, or, in certain cases, changes to the academic credentials that it\noffers. In certain circumstances, ED must provisionally certify an institution, such as when it is an initial participant in Title IV programs, or has undergone a change in ownership and control.\nA provisionally certified institution must apply for and receive ED approval of substantial changes and must comply with any additional conditions included in its program participation agreement. If ED determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, it may seek to revoke the institution\u2019s certification to participate in Title IV programs with fewer due process protections for the institution than if it were fully certified.\nAPUS is fully recertified to participate in Title IV programs through September 30, 2020. APUS will be required to apply timely for recertification in order to continue to participate in the Title IV programs after September 30, 2020.\nHCON was deemed to have undergone a change of ownership and control in November 2013, requiring review by ED in order to reestablish eligibility and continue participation in Title IV programs. In January 2016 we received a letter from ED approving the change in ownership and control and granting HCON provisional certification to participate in Title IV programs until December 31, 2018. HCON received a fully executed Provisional Program Participation Agreement, or PPPA, in February 2016. While provisionally certified, HCON operates under the PPPA, which requires HCON to apply for and receive approval from the Secretary of Education before initiating any substantial changes, such as establishing an additional location at which at least 50% of an eligible program will be offered and Title IV program funds will be disbursed, offering academic programs at higher than the bachelor\u2019s degree level, or adding a new education program. During the term of the PPPA, HCON\u2019s participation in Title IV programs is subject to revocation for cause, which includes a failure to comply with any provision set forth in the PPPA, a violation of ED regulations deemed material by ED, or a material misrepresentation in the material submitted to ED as part of the institution\u2019s application for approval of the change of ownership and control.\nIf ED were to withdraw or not renew our institutions\u2019 certification to participate in Title IV programs, our students would no longer be able to receive Title IV program funds, which would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenue, and results of operations.\nIf our institutions are unable to successfully maintain certification or obtain recertification to participate in Title IV programs they will not be able to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs.\nIf our institutions are unable to successfully maintain certification or obtain recertification to participate in ED\u2019s Title IV programs, they will not be able to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs because the DoD MOU requires an institution to be certified to participate in Title IV programs in order to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs. Loss of participation in the DoD tuition assistance programs would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenue, results of operations, and financial condition.\nA failure to demonstrate \u201cadministrative capability\u201d may result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nED\u2019s regulations specify extensive criteria an institution must satisfy to establish that it has the requisite \u201cadministrative capability\u201d to participate in Title IV programs and the sanctions ED may impose if an institution fails to satisfy any of those criteria. To meet the administrative capability standards, an institution must, among other things, comply with all applicable Title IV requirements, including with respect to the administration of Title IV programs and the processing of Title IV program funds. See \u201cRegulatory Environment - Federal Support and Regulation of Postsecondary Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - Administrative Capability.\u201d If an institution fails to satisfy any of the administrative capability requirements, ED may require the repayment of Title IV program funds, transfer the institution from the \u201cadvance\u201d system of payment of Title IV program funds to heightened cash monitoring status, or to the \u201creimbursement\u201d method of payment, place the institution on provisional certification status, or commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend, or terminate the participation of the institution in Title IV programs.\nIf one of our institutions is found not to have satisfied ED\u2019s \u201cadministrative capability\u201d requirements, it could be limited in its access to, or lose, Title IV program funding, which would limit our potential for growth and adversely affect our enrollment, revenue, and results of operations.\nA failure to demonstrate \u201cfinancial responsibility\u201d may result in the loss of eligibility by one of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs or require the posting of a letter of credit in order to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nTo participate in Title IV programs, an eligible institution must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by ED, or post a letter of credit in favor of ED, and possibly accept other conditions, such as provisional certification, additional reporting requirements, or regulatory oversight of its participation in Title IV programs. ED may also apply such measures of financial responsibility to a parent company of an eligible institution and, if such measures are not satisfied by the parent company, require the institution to post a letter of credit in favor of ED, and possibly accept other conditions on its participation in Title IV programs. An obligation to post a letter of credit, or to accept other conditions, such as a change in our system of Title IV payment from ED for purposes of disbursement, could increase our costs of regulatory compliance, or affect our cash flow. If one of our institutions is found not to have satisfied ED\u2019s \u201cfinancial responsibility\u201d requirements, it could be limited in its access to, or lose, Title IV program funds, which would limit our potential for growth and adversely affect our enrollment, revenue, and results of operations. If we, as the parent company of an eligible institution, are found not to have satisfied ED\u2019s financial responsibility requirements, all of our institutions could be limited in their access to, or lose, Title IV program funds.\nIf our institutions do not comply with the 90/10 Rule, they will lose eligibility to participate in federal student financial aid programs.\nA provision of the HEA requires all proprietary education institutions to comply with what is commonly referred to as the 90/10 Rule, which imposes sanctions on participating institutions that derive more than 90% of their total revenue on a cash accounting basis from Title IV programs as calculated under ED\u2019s regulations. For more information including the 90/10 percentages for our institutions, see \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - The 90/10 Rule.\u201d\nThe 90/10 Rule percentage for our institutions could increase in the future, depending on the impact of future changes in our enrollment mix, and regulatory and other factors outside our control, including any reduction in tuition assistance provided by the DoD for service members and education benefits provided by the VA for veterans, or changes in the treatment of such funding for purposes of the 90/10 Rule calculation. Currently, DoD tuition assistance and VA education benefits are not treated as Title IV revenue under the 90/10 Rule and, therefore, for APUS, a majority of such funding is included in the \u201c10%\u201d portion of the rule calculation. A reduction in the availability of this type of funding, or a change (through legislation, regulatory action, or an executive order) that requires that those funds be treated in the same manner as Title IV funding under the 90/10 Rule, would increase our institutions\u2019 90/10 Rule percentage. If any of our institutions violates the 90/10 Rule and loses eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, its ineligibility to participate in Title IV programs would have a material adverse effect on our enrollments, revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA failure by our institutions to comply with the Department of Education\u2019s incentive payment rule could result in sanctions.\nIf one of our institutions pays a bonus, commission, or other incentive payment in violation of applicable ED rules, that institution could be subject to sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If ED determines that one of our institutions violated the incentive payment rule, it may require the institution to modify its payment arrangements to ED\u2019s satisfaction. ED may also fine the institution or initiate action to limit, suspend, or terminate the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV programs. ED may also seek to recover Title IV funds disbursed in connection with the prohibited incentive payments. As described in \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - Incentive Payment Rule,\u201d abolition of regulatory safe harbors that described permissible arrangements, and other recent changes in the regulation and its interpretation, may create uncertainty about what constitutes impermissible incentive payments. The modified incentive payment rule and related uncertainty as to how it will be interpreted also may influence our approach, or limit our alternatives, with respect to employment policies and practices and consequently may negatively affect our ability to recruit and retain employees, and, as a result, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, has issued a report critical of ED\u2019s enforcement of the incentive payment rule, and ED has undertaken to increase its enforcement efforts.\nThe DoD\u2019s 2014 MOU requires that institutions participating in the DoD tuition assistance programs have policies in place compliant with regulations issued by ED related to restrictions on payment of incentive compensation. Under the terms of the DoD MOU, an institution participating in the DoD tuition assistance programs must refrain from providing any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on securing enrollments or federal financial aid, including DoD tuition assistance program funds, to any persons or entities engaged in student recruiting, admission activities, or making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance. In 2013, the Improving Transparency of Education Opportunities for Veterans Acts established a ban on incentive compensation based on success in securing enrollments or financial aid with regard to VA benefits.\nOn June 2, 2015, ED released a memorandum regarding enforcement of the prohibition on the payment of incentive compensation by postsecondary institutions to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admissions activities or in making decisions regarding the award of student financial assistance based directly or indirectly upon success in securing enrollments or financial aid. Institutions agree to comply with the incentive compensation rules as a condition of their participation in the Title IV program. The memorandum indicated that ED will revise its approach to measuring damages for noncompliance with the prohibition against incentive compensation. In administrative enforcement actions, ED will calculate the amount of the institutional liability based on the cost to ED of the Title IV funds improperly received by the institution, including the cost to ED of all of the Title IV funds received by the institution over a particular period of time if those funds were obtained through implementation of a policy or practice in which students were recruited in violation of the incentive compensation prohibition. ED may also impose a fine upon an institution, or take administrative action to limit, suspend, revoke, deny, or terminate an institution\u2019s eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs, if the institution violates the prohibition. We are currently unable to predict the impact that ED's revised approach to measuring damages under the incentive compensation prohibition might have on our financial condition if one of our institutions is found to be in violation of the prohibition.\nIn addition, third parties may file \u201cqui tam\u201d or \u201cwhistleblower\u201d suits on behalf of the federal government alleging violation of the incentive payment provision. Such suits may prompt ED investigations, and the federal government may determine to intervene in the lawsuits. Particularly in light of the uncertainty surrounding the modified incentive payment rule and ED\u2019s June 2015 memorandum, the existence of, the costs of responding to, and the outcome of, qui tam or whistleblower suits or ED investigations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation causing our enrollments to decline, could cause us to incur costs that are material to our business, and could impact the ability of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs, among other things. As a result, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nA failure to comply with the Department of Education's \"gainful employment\" regulations could result in the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nUnder the HEA, proprietary schools are generally eligible to participate in Title IV programs only in respect of educational programs that prepare students for \u201cgainful employment in a recognized occupation.\u201d Historically, this concept has not been defined in detailed regulations. On October 29, 2010 and June 13, 2011, ED published final regulations on gainful employment. For more information, see \u201cRegulatory Environment - Federal Support and Regulation of Postsecondary Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - Gainful Employment\u201d in this Annual Report. In response to a legal challenge to ED\u2019s gainful employment regulations, on June 30, 2012 the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia struck down the debt measures and all other gainful employment requirements except the disclosure requirements. On March 19, 2013, the court denied ED\u2019s motion to reinstate certain of those regulations. Because the disclosure requirements were not stuck down, institutions were required to comply with the disclosure requirements.\nIn September 2013, ED convened a negotiated rulemaking committee, which we refer to as the Gainful Employment Rulemaking Committee, to prepare proposed regulations to replace those struck down by the federal court. The Gainful Employment Rulemaking Committee met in the fall of 2013, but did not achieve consensus on regulatory language. On October 31, 2014, ED published the final regulations related to gainful employment, which we refer to as the Final GE Regulations. On July 1, 2015, the Final GE Regulations went into effect, with the exception of new disclosure requirements, which take effect January 1, 2017. The Final GE Regulations establish debt-related measures for determining whether certain postsecondary education programs prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The Final GE Regulations set forth two debt-to-earnings measures: an annual earnings rate and a discretionary income rate. Under the Final GE Regulations, a program will pass the measures if its graduates have annual loan payments less than or equal to 8% of their total earnings or less than or equal to 20% of their discretionary income. A program that does not pass either of the debt-to-earnings measures and that has an annual earnings rate that is greater than 8% and less than or equal to 12%, or a discretionary income rate that is greater than 20% and less than or equal to 30%, would be considered to be in a warning \u201czone.\u201d Subject to the potential for adjustments based on a transition period, a program will fail the measures if its annual earnings rate is greater than 12% (or the denominator of the rate (annual earnings) is zero) and its discretionary income rate is greater than 30% (or the income for the denominator of the rate (discretionary earnings) is negative or zero).\nA program will become ineligible for Title IV funding if it fails both debt-to-earnings measures twice in three consecutive years, or if the program is in the \u201czone\u201d for four consecutive years. An institution will be required to provide warnings to students, including prospective students, when notified by ED that a program could become ineligible based on its final debt-to-earnings measures for the next award year.\nIn addition to the debt-to-earnings measures, the Final GE Regulations include additional requirements related to gainful employment programs. For example, the Final GE Regulations require an institution\u2019s most senior executive officer to certify, as part of the program participation agreement, that each of its eligible gainful employment programs offered by the\ninstitution satisfies certain requirements related to institutional and programmatic accreditation and professional licensure, or certification exam requirements. Also, the Final GE Regulations expand upon the gainful employment program disclosure requirements.\nThe Final GE Regulations could put the continuing Title IV eligibility of our educational programs at risk due to factors beyond our control, such as changes in the actual or deemed income level of our graduates, changes in student borrowing levels, increases in interest rates, changes in the federal poverty income level relevant for calculating discretionary income, and other factors. Failure to satisfy the gainful employment measures could reduce the ability of our institutions to offer or continue certain types of programs for which there is market demand, which could therefore impact our ability to maintain or grow our business. Additionally, the expanded gainful employment program disclosure requirements could adversely impact student enrollment, persistence, and retention if our institutions\u2019 disclosed program information compares unfavorably with disclosed information of other educational institutions.\nOur institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if their student loan default rates are too high, and if our institutions lose that eligibility our future growth could be impaired.\nTo remain eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an educational institution\u2019s federal student loan cohort default rates must remain below certain specified levels. Each cohort is the group of students who first enter into student loan repayment during a federal fiscal year (ending September 30). The measurement period for the student loan cohort default rates increased from two to three years starting with the 2009 cohort. For more information including the default rates of our institutions, see \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - Student Loan Defaults.\u201d Given that APUS and HCON only relatively recently began to participate in Title IV programs and that the number of students receiving Title IV program funds has grown significantly over time, the cohort default rates in the first few years of participation may not be indicative of the rates that will be applicable to both institutions over the long term as a greater number of students enter repayment.\nIf an institution\u2019s three-year cohort default rate equals or exceeds 30% for any given year, it must establish a default prevention task force and develop a default prevention plan with measurable objectives for improving the cohort default rate. Beginning with the three-year cohort default rate for the 2011 cohort published in September 2014, only three-year cohort default rates will be applied for purposes of measuring compliance. Educational institutions will lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if their three-year cohort default rate exceeds 40% for any given year or is equal to or greater than 30% for three consecutive years.\nIf one of our institutions is required to develop a default prevention plan, it may increase our administrative costs which would adversely impact our results of operations. Recently there has been increased attention by members of Congress and others on default prevention activities of proprietary education institutions. If such attention leads to Congressional or regulatory action restricting the types of default prevention assistance that educational institutions are permitted to provide, the default rates of our former students may be negatively impacted. Such attention could also lead to Congressional proposals to increase the measuring period, which could negatively impact our default rates. Members of Congress have also introduced proposed legislation that would assess institutions a share of the costs associated with default of student loans by students who were enrolled in the institutions\u2019 education programs and would tie an institution\u2019s obligation to make such \u201crisk-sharing\u201d payments to the institution\u2019s eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs. If one of our institutions loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs because of high student loan default rates, students would no longer be eligible to use Title IV program funds at that institution, which would significantly reduce that institution\u2019s enrollments and revenue and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to administer our institutions\u2019 participation in Title IV programs and their failure to perform services as agreed or to comply with applicable regulations could cause us to lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nED\u2019s regulations permit an institution to enter into a written contract with a third-party servicer for the administration of any aspect of the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV programs. The third-party servicer must, among other obligations, comply with Title IV requirements and be jointly and severally liable with the institution to the Secretary of Education for any violation by the servicer of any Title IV provision. Our institutions utilize third-party servicers for some services, such as financial aid processing, default management, and processing student credit balance refunds, and in the future may consider using third-party servicers for other functions that are currently managed directly by our institutions. If any third-party servicer that we have engaged does not comply with applicable statutes and regulations including the HEA, our institutions may be liable for its actions, and our institutions could lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. In the event that one of our third-party servicers fails to perform the services as agreed it may impact our ability to operate, negatively impact our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, and otherwise negatively materially impact our financial condition. Further, in the event that\nour institutions transition to or from a third-party servicer for any of its services there would be costs and risks related to the transition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur institutions will be subject to sanctions that could be material to our results and damage our reputation if the Department of Education determines that our institutions failed to correctly calculate and timely return Title IV program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program.\nAn institution participating in Title IV programs must correctly calculate the amount of unearned Title IV program funds that have been disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completion, and must return those unearned funds to the Title IV programs in a timely manner, generally within 45 days after the date the school determines that the student has withdrawn. Under ED regulations, late returns of Title IV program funds for 5% or more of students sampled in connection with the institution\u2019s annual compliance audit constitute material noncompliance for which an institution generally must submit an irrevocable letter of credit.\nHCON\u2019s Title IV compliance audit for the year ended December 31, 2012, identified a deficiency related to timely return of Title IV program funds. In a Preliminary Audit Determination Letter dated July 10, 2013, ED requested additional information from HCON about the situation and required HCON to conduct a file review to identify those files that reflected an inaccurate refund. ED said that the matter would be addressed as part of its review of HCON\u2019s application for a change of ownership that HCON filed in connection with our acquisition of it on November 1, 2013. If ED determines that Title IV funds were not properly calculated and timely returned, we may have to repay Title IV funds, post a letter of credit with ED in an amount equal to 25% of the total dollar amount of unearned Title IV funds that the institution was required to return with respect to withdrawn students during the most recently completed fiscal year, or otherwise be sanctioned by ED, which could increase HCON\u2019s cost of regulatory compliance and adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur institutions\u2019 failure to comply with ED\u2019s substantial misrepresentation rules could result in material sanctions.\nED may take action against an institution in the event of substantial misrepresentation by the institution concerning the nature of its educational programs, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. The Program Integrity Regulations expanded the definition of \u201csubstantial misrepresentation\u201d to cover additional representatives of the institution and additional substantive areas, expanded the parties to whom a substantial misrepresentation cannot be made, and increased actions ED may take if it determines that an institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation. An institution engages in substantial misrepresentation when the institution itself, one of its representatives, or an organization or person with which the institution has an agreement to provide educational programs, marketing, advertising, or admissions services, makes a substantial misrepresentation directly or indirectly to a student, prospective student or any member of the public, or to an accrediting agency, a state agency, or to the Secretary of Education.\nIf ED determines that an institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, ED may (i) if the institution is provisionally certified, revoke an institution\u2019s program participation agreement or impose limitations on its participation in Title IV programs, (ii) deny participation applications made on behalf of the institution, or (iii) initiate a proceeding against the institution to fine the institution or to limit, suspend or terminate the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV programs. We expect that there could be an industry-wide increase in administrative actions and litigation claiming substantial misrepresentation. If such administrative actions or litigation were brought against us or our institutions, we could incur legal costs related to their investigation and defense, which could materially and adversely impact our financial condition. In December 2015, ED sent HCON a letter informing HCON that ED had determined to fine HCON $27,500 based on ED\u2019s finding that HCON had substantially misrepresented its programmatic accreditation status during a time period prior to our ownership of HCON. HCON paid the fine in December 2015. For more information, see the \u201cRegulatory Environment - Regulatory Actions and Restrictions on Operations - Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control - U.S. Department of Education\u201d section of this Annual Report.\nFailure to comply with ED\u2019s credit hour requirements could result in sanctions.\nIn the Program Integrity Regulations, ED defined \u201ccredit hour\u201d for Title IV purposes as an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates certain specified time in class and outside class, or an equivalent amount of work for other academic activities. The Program Integrity Regulations also require institutional accreditors to review the reliability and accuracy of an institution\u2019s credit hour assignments. An accreditor must take appropriate actions to address an institution\u2019s credit hour deficiencies and to notify ED if it finds systemic noncompliance or significant noncompliance in one or more programs. ED has indicated that if it finds an institution to be out of compliance with the credit hour definition for Title IV purposes, it may require the institution to repay the amount of Title IV awarded under the incorrect assignment of credit hours and, if it finds significant overstatement of credit hours, it may fine the institution or limit, suspend, or terminate its participation\nin Title IV programs. Any such action could materially and adversely affect the business of our institutions. For more information, see the \u201cRegulatory Environment - Student Financing Sources and Related Regulations/Requirements - Department of Education - Regulation of Title IV Financial Aid Programs - Credit Hours\u201d section of this Annual Report.\nGovernment and regulatory agencies and third parties may conduct compliance reviews, bring claims, or initiate enforcement actions or litigation against us, any of which could disrupt our institutions\u2019 operations and adversely affect their performance.\nBecause our institutions operate in a highly regulated industry, we are subject to audits, compliance reviews, inquiries, complaints, investigations, claims of noncompliance, enforcement proceedings, and lawsuits by government agencies, regulatory agencies, and third parties, including claims brought by third parties on behalf of the federal government. For example, ED regularly conducts program reviews of educational institutions that are participating in Title IV programs and the ED OIG regularly conducts audits and investigations of such institutions. In February 2016, ED announced the creation of a Student Aid Enforcement Unit to enable ED to respond more quickly and efficiently to allegations of illegal actions by higher education institutions. The Enforcement Unit will collaborate with state and federal agencies to enforce violations of law and will work with ED\u2019s Program Compliance Unit to review evidence that may affect program reviews. The Federal Trade Commission has investigated and in some cases brought lawsuits against proprietary institutions alleging that the institutions engaged in deceptive trade practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has sued proprietary institutions for engaging in allegedly illegal predatory lending practices. If the results of compliance reviews or other proceedings are unfavorable to us, or if we are unable to defend successfully against lawsuits or claims, our institutions may be required to pay monetary damages or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of Title IV funding, injunctions, or other penalties, including the requirement to make refunds. Even if our institutions adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim, we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those reviews or to defend against those lawsuits or claims. Claims and lawsuits brought against us or one of our institutions may result in reputational damage, even if such claims and lawsuits are without merit. Any one of these sanctions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and result in the imposition of significant restrictions on us and our institutions, which may materially adversely affect our ability to operate.\nInvestigations by state Attorneys General, Congress, and governmental agencies may result in increased regulatory burdens and costs.\nWe and other proprietary postsecondary education providers have been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and litigation in recent years. State Attorneys General have increasingly focused on allegations of improper recruiting compensation and deceptive marketing practices, among other issues. A number of state Attorneys General have launched investigations into proprietary postsecondary education institutions. In July 2011, the Attorney General of Kentucky announced a national bipartisan effort, which now includes approximately 30 states, to examine potential abuses by proprietary educational institutions. While the initial goal of the joint investigation is sharing information among the Attorneys General about potential violations of consumer protection laws, the Attorney General of Kentucky indicated that the Attorneys General may ultimately attempt to compel proprietary institutions located in their respective jurisdictions to revise their recruiting practices. In January 2014, many of the publicly traded for-profit postsecondary institutions, not including us, received demands for information from a network of 12 state Attorneys General relating to, among other matters, the recruitment of students, admissions standards, graduate placement statistics, graduate certification and licensing results, and student lending activities. In June 2014, the Massachusetts\u2019 Attorney General released several consumer protection regulations, which, among other things, require certain disclosures that apply to for-profit and occupational schools operating in the state. Actions by state Attorneys General and other governmental agencies, whether or not involving us or our institutions, could damage our reputation and the reputation of our institutions and limit the ability to recruit and enroll students, which could reduce student demand for our institutions\u2019 programs and adversely impact our revenue and cash flow from operations.\nIn recent years, the student lending practices of postsecondary educational institutions, financial aid officers, and student loan providers have been subjected to several investigations by state Attorneys General, Congress, and governmental agencies. These investigations concern, among other things, possible deceptive practices in the marketing of private student loans and loans provided by lenders pursuant to Title IV programs. The HEOA contains requirements pertinent to relationships between lenders and institutions. The HEOA also imposes substantive and disclosure obligations on institutions that make available a list of recommended lenders for potential borrowers. New procedures introduced and recommendations made by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also create uncertainty about whether Congress will impose new burdens on private student lenders. State legislators have also passed or may be considering legislation related to relationships between lenders and institutions. Further, several federal agencies recently implemented an online student complaint system for service members, veterans, and their families to report negative experiences at educational institutions and training programs administering the Post-9/11 GI Bill, DoD tuition assistance programs, and other military-related education benefit programs. We can neither know nor predict\nwith certainty the effects of such developments. Governmental action may impose increased administrative and regulatory costs and adversely affect our financial condition.\nIf we undergo a change in ownership and control, the Department of Education will place our institutions on provisional certification, and the terms of that provisional certification could limit our institutions\u2019 potential for growth and adversely affect our institutions\u2019 enrollment, our revenue, and results of operations.\nED\u2019s regulations provide that a change of control of a publicly traded corporation occurs if: (i) there is an event that would obligate the corporation to file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing a change of control; or (ii) the corporation has a stockholder that owns at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest stockholder of the corporation, and that stockholder ceases to own at least 25% of such stock or ceases to be the largest stockholder. A significant purchase or disposition of our voting stock could be determined by ED to be a change in ownership and control under this standard. Under the HEA, an institution whose parent undergoes a change in ownership resulting in a change in control loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and must apply to ED in order to reestablish such eligibility.\nFuture transactions could constitute a change in ownership or control under ED\u2019s regulations and could cause ED to place our institutions on provisional certification as required by the HEA. The conditions of provisional certification or closer review by ED could impact, among other things, our institutions\u2019 ability to add educational programs, or additional locations, our ability to acquire other institutions, or our ability to make other significant changes. In addition, if ED were to determine that our institutions were unable to meet their responsibilities while they were provisionally certified, ED could seek to revoke our institutions\u2019 certification to participate in Title IV programs with fewer due process protections than if they were fully certified. Limitations on our institutions\u2019 operations could, and the loss of our institutions\u2019 certification to participate in Title IV programs would, adversely affect our institutions\u2019 ability to grow in addition to having adverse effects on their enrollment, and our revenue and results of operations.\nIf regulators do not approve or delay their approval of transactions involving a change of control of our company or of institutions that we own or acquire, our and our institutions\u2019 ability to operate could be impaired.\nIf we or one of our institutions experience a change of ownership or control under the standards of applicable state regulatory bodies, accrediting agencies, ED, or other regulators, we or the institution governed by such agencies must notify or seek the approval of each relevant regulatory agency. Transactions or events that constitute a change of control include significant acquisitions or dispositions of an institution\u2019s common stock, significant changes in the composition of an institution\u2019s Board of Directors, internal restructurings, acquisitions of institutions from other owners, or certain other transactions. Some of these transactions or events may be beyond our control. Our or our institutions\u2019 failure to obtain, or a delay in receiving, approval of any change of control from the relevant regulatory agencies following a transaction involving a change of ownership or control could result in a suspension of operating authority, loss of accreditation, or suspension or loss of federal student financial aid funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our institutions and our financial condition. Our failure to obtain, or a delay in receiving, approval of any change of control from other states in which we are currently licensed or authorized could require our institutions to suspend activities in that state or otherwise impair our institutions\u2019 operations. The potential adverse effects of a change of control could influence, among other things, future decisions by us and our stockholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance, or redemption of our stock. In addition, the regulatory burdens and risks associated with a change of control also could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nCertain contingents of the U.S. Congress have been examining the proprietary postsecondary education sector, which could result in legislation, heightened oversight, or additional Department of Education rulemaking that may limit or condition Title IV program participation of proprietary schools in a manner that may materially and adversely affect our business.\nIn recent years, certain contingents of the U.S. Congress have increased their focus on proprietary educational institutions. This increased focus has resulted in the introduction of various pieces of legislation, the holding of several hearings by various Congressional committees, and Congressional investigations and inquiries. We have previously incurred significant legal and other costs to respond to Congressional inquiries, and could incur significant legal and other costs to respond to any future inquiries. We cannot predict the extent to which, or whether, these hearings and investigations will result in legislation, further rulemaking affecting our participation in Title IV programs, or litigation alleging statutory violations, regulatory infractions or common law causes of action. The adoption of any law or regulation that reduces funding for federal student financial aid programs or the ability of our institutions or students to participate in these programs could have a material adverse effect on our student population and revenue. Legislative action also may increase our administrative costs and require our institutions to modify their practices in order to comply with applicable requirements. Additionally, members of Congress have also from time to time encouraged ED to adopt additional regulations for participation in Title IV Programs that could increase\nour cost of operations or expose us to additional risks. For example, in February 2016, nine Senators encouraged ED to adopt a requirement that would prohibit institutions that participate in the Title IV programs from including binding arbitration clauses, bans on class actions or other contractual barriers to court access in student enrollment agreements. If ED were to adopt regulations for this purpose, we and our institutions could be exposed to litigation that could be less efficient than resolving disputes through arbitration and could force us to incur legal and other expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nCongressional examination of DoD oversight of tuition assistance used for distance education and proprietary institutions could result in legislative or regulatory changes that may materially and adversely affect our business.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Congress has increased its focus on DoD tuition assistance that is used for distance education and programs at for-profit institutions. In September 2010, the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations of the U.S. House of Representative\u2019s Armed Services Committee held a hearing titled \u201cA Question of Quality and Value: Department of Defense Oversight of Tuition Assistance Used for Distance Learning and For-Profit Colleges.\u201d Witnesses and Subcommittee members expressed concern about DoD\u2019s oversight of distance education programs, especially those offered by proprietary institutions. In addition, in December 2010, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, or HELP, released a report entitled \u201cBenefitting Whom? For-Profit Education Companies and the Growth of Military Educational Benefits,\u201d which raised questions about the growing share of DoD tuition assistance received by for-profit institutions. In March 2011, the GAO published a report entitled \u201cDoD Education Benefits: Increased Oversight of Tuition Assistance Program is Needed,\u201d which offered several recommendations for improving accountability within the tuition assistance program. In September 2011, the Senate Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government Information, Federal Services, and International Security held a hearing focused on the classification of military education benefits under the 90/10 Rule. Some of the panelists suggested that the classification of military benefits as non-Title IV revenue for purposes of the 90/10 Rule has led some for-profit institutions to recruit aggressively and sometimes illegally members of the military in order to ensure compliance with the 90/10 Rule.\nThe 90/10 Rule has been a subject of interest over the past several Congresses, which has resulted in several members of Congress introducing proposals and legislation that would modify the 90/10 Rule. One past proposal would decrease the limit from 90% to 85% and would count DoD tuition assistance and VA education benefits toward that limit. Such a proposal or other similar legislation, should it become law, could have a material adverse impact on the operations of APUS and HCON. We cannot predict the extent to which, or whether, Congressional hearings will result in legislation or further rulemaking affecting our institutions\u2019 ability to participate in DoD tuition assistance programs or Title IV programs. Members of Congress have stated, both in committee hearings and in the HELP Committee report, that Congress should revise the 90/10 Rule to count DoD tuition assistance and VA veterans educational benefits toward the 90% limit. We cannot predict the likelihood that Congress will amend the 90/10 Rule to count DoD tuition assistance and VA education benefits toward the 90% limit or to lower the ratio to 85/15, nor can we predict the likelihood that Congress or the President will take some other action to limit the use of DoD tuition assistance and VA education benefits at for-profit institutions. To the extent that any laws or regulations are adopted that limit or condition the participation of proprietary schools or distance education programs in DoD tuition assistance programs or in Title IV programs, or that limit or condition the amount of DoD tuition assistance for which for-profit schools or distance education programs are eligible to receive, our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nCongress has in the past changed, and may in the future change, eligibility standards and funding levels for federal student financial aid programs, DoD tuition assistance, and other programs. Other governmental or regulatory bodies may also change similar laws or regulations relating to such programs, which could adversely affect our student population, revenue and financial condition.\nPolitical and budgetary concerns can significantly affect Title IV programs, military tuition assistance programs, and other laws and regulations governing federal and state aid programs.\nTitle IV programs are made available pursuant to the provisions of the HEA, and the HEA comes up for reauthorization by Congress approximately every five to six years. Authorization of appropriations for most HEA programs is currently provided through September 30, 2016 by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016. In the past, Congress has passed short-term nonsubstantive extensions of the HEA pending comprehensive reauthorization legislation. Further, when Congress does not act on comprehensive reauthorization through a single piece of legislation, it may act through multiple pieces of legislation. Congress completed the most recent reauthorization through multiple pieces of legislation and may reauthorize the HEA in a piecemeal manner in the future. Additionally, Congress determines the funding level for each Title IV program on an annual basis.\nFuture Congressional action, including in reauthorizations or appropriations acts, may result in numerous legislative changes, including those that could adversely affect the ability of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs, DoD tuition\nassistance programs, and the availability of such funding sources for our students. Members of Congress frequently propose legislation to alter or amend the terms under which our institutions participate in the federal student financial aid programs. Any action by Congress that significantly reduces funding for Title IV programs or the ability of our institutions or students to participate in these programs could materially harm our institutions\u2019 business. A reduction in government funding levels could lead to lower enrollments at our institutions and require our institutions to arrange for alternative sources of financial aid for their students. Lower student enrollments at our institutions or their inability to arrange alternative sources of funding could adversely affect our financial condition. Congressional action may also require our institutions to modify their practices in ways that could result in increased administrative and regulatory expenses.\nWe are not in a position to predict whether any legislation will be passed by Congress or signed into law in the future. The reallocation of funding among Title IV programs, material changes in the requirements for participation in such programs, or the substitution of materially different Title IV programs could reduce the ability of certain students to finance their education at our institutions and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nRecent regulatory developments may adversely impact our institutions' enrollment, financial condition, results of operations, expenses, and cash flows.\nOn June 8, 2015, ED issued a fact sheet where it announced debt relief mechanisms that it asserts are designed to hold for-profit institutions accountable. The announcement specifically addresses debt relief for students at Corinthian Colleges' schools that closed and Corinthian Colleges' schools that did not close, but the fact sheet is framed more broadly. In the fact sheet, ED discusses the ability to discharge federal student loans, which we refer to as Federal Loans, when an institution closes. Generally, pursuant to ED's regulations, when an institution closes, students are eligible to discharge their Federal Direct Loans if they were attending the institution when it closed or had withdrawn within 120 days of the closing date. ED also points out that ED regulations provide Federal Direct Loan recipients with a defense against an attempt to collect their Federal Loans based on an act or omission of the institution that would give rise to a cause of action under applicable state law. ED indicates that such provision has \u201crarely been used in the past\u201d and that it is taking \u201cunprecedented action\u201d with respect to Corinthian Colleges' students to extend debt relief to such students wherever possible. In the fact sheet ED also announced plans to develop new regulations to \u201cclarify and streamline loan forgiveness\u201d under the loan discharge provision. The failure of our institutions to comply with state laws may result in liability to, or remedial action against, our institutions, including recoupment by ED of discharged student loan funds under the defense to repayment provisions. The assertion of any claims by our institutions' students under the \u201cdefense to repayment\u201d provisions and any resulting remedial action, or any recoupment by ED of discharged student loan funds pursuant to the defense to repayment provisions could damage our reputation in the industry and have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenue, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.On October 20, 2015, ED announced that it would establish a new negotiated rulemaking committee to develop proposed regulations for determining which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a student borrower may assert as a defense to repayment of a loan made under the Federal Direct Loan Program (\u201cborrower defenses\u201d) and the consequences of such borrower defenses for borrowers, institutions, and ED. ED further announced that the rulemaking committee is intended to address (i) the procedures to be used for a borrower to establish a defense to repayment; (ii) the criteria that ED will use to identify acts or omissions of an institution that constitute defenses to repayment of Federal Loans; (iii) the standards and procedures that ED will use to determine the liability of the institution participating in the Federal Loan Program for amounts based on borrower defenses; (iv) the effect of borrower defenses on institutional capability assessments; and (v) other loan discharges. The rulemaking committee met for the first time in January 2016 and is scheduled to meet again in February and March of 2016. We are unable to predict when ED may ultimately issue regulations on these topics. If ED determines that borrowers of Federal Direct Loans who attended our institutions have a defense to repayment of their Federal Loans based on a state law claim, the repayment liability to ED could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOn October 27, 2015, ED announced the publication of final regulations governing the Federal Direct Loan Program to create a new income-contingent repayment plan in accordance with the President\u2019s initiative to allow more Federal Direct Loan borrowers to cap their loan payments at 10 percent of their monthly incomes. This new income-contingent repayment plan, called the Revised Pay As You Earn repayment plan, or REPAYE plan, became available in December 2015 to all Direct Loan student borrowers regardless of when the borrower took out the loans. In addition, the regulations, which are generally effective July 1, 2016, implement changes to the Federal Family Education Loan Program, or FFEL Program, and Direct Loan Program regulations to streamline and enhance existing processes and provide additional support to struggling borrowers, including, among other things, establishing new procedures for FFEL Program loan holders to identify service members who may be eligible for benefits under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The regulations also expand the circumstances under which an institution could challenge or appeal a draft or final cohort default rate, beginning in February 2017. We cannot predict the extent to which these final regulations will impact our institutions, nor can we predict possible regulatory burdens and costs.\nOn October 27, 2015, ED announced the publication of final regulations to amend ED's cash management regulations, which we refer to as the Cash Management Regulations. The Cash Management Regulations go into effect on July 1, 2016. Among other topics, the Cash Management Regulations address arrangements between postsecondary institutions and financial account providers to disburse Title IV Program credit balances to students, including through the use of debit or prepaid cards. The Cash Management Regulations require institutions to establish a process to facilitate student choice in how students receive Title IV Program federal student financial aid credit balances; limit the personally identifiable information about students that may be shared with financial account providers; and require institutions to obtain student consent before opening an account in the student\u2019s name. Under the Cash Management Regulations, an institution that has entered into an arrangement with a financial account provider must mitigate certain fees incurred by Title IV aid recipients, and certain types of fees are prohibited. The Cash Management Regulations require that contracts governing arrangements with financial account providers be publicly disclosed and evaluated in light of the best financial interests of students. The Cash Management Regulations also make other changes to requirements for the institutional administration of Title IV Programs, including by clarifying how previously passed coursework is treated for Title IV eligibility purposes, altering the requirements for converting clock hours to credit hours, and updating other provisions in ED\u2019s cash management regulations. For example, the Cash Management Regulations establish a requirement that institutions participating in the Title IV Programs under the reimbursement or heightened cash monitoring payment methods must pay any credit balance due to a student before seeking reimbursement or a request for funds, respectively. The Cash Management Regulations also specify the circumstances under which an institution may include the cost of books and supplies as part of institutional tuition and fees charged to a student, such as if the institution has made arrangements with publishers to obtain books at below-market rates or if books or electronic course materials are not available elsewhere. Our institutions utilize a third party servicer to provide services related to the disbursement of Title IV financial aid credit balance refunds. We are currently unable to predict the impact that compliance with the Cash Management Regulations might have on our operations and operating results.\nPresident Obama directed ED to develop and publish a new college ratings system by the 2015-2016 school year. On December 19, 2014, ED issued a framework for the college ratings system. On June 25, 2015, ED stated that in lieu of creating its previously announced college ratings system, it would instead create a consumer-driven website that will allow users to compare colleges based on measures that may be of importance to them. In September 2015, ED publicly released its \u201cCollege Scorecard\u201d website. Among other characteristics, the College Scorecard allows users to search for schools based upon programs offered, location, size, tax status, mission, and religious affiliation. We do not believe the College Scorecard is an appropriate indicator of APUS's graduation rate because the College Scorecard's graduation rate only includes the performance of first time, full-time undergraduate which represents less than approximately 1% of all APUS students. Furthermore, substantially all of the other College Scorecard measures are based on students who are recipients of Title IV program funds; such students represent a minority of APUS's students. We cannot predict the extent to which the College Scorecard may impact our institution's enrollments, reputation, or operating results, including if students exclude our institutions from consideration because of the College Scorecard\u2019s presentation of our graduation rate, the focus on tax status and our status as a for profit business or because of other factors.\nWe cannot predict the nature of any final rules, actions or interpretations that may be implemented as a result of the aforementioned, or any future, actions by ED. However, these and future regulatory developments may adversely impact our institutions' enrollments, financial condition, results of operations, expenses, and cash flows.\nOur regulatory environment and our reputation may be negatively influenced by the actions of other for-profit institutions.\nOur institutions are two of a much larger number of for-profit institutions serving the postsecondary education market. In recent years, regulatory investigations and civil litigation have been commenced against several for-profit educational institutions. These investigations and lawsuits have alleged, among other things, deceptive trade practices and noncompliance with ED regulations. These allegations have attracted adverse media coverage and have been the subject of federal and state legislative hearings. Broader allegations against the overall for-profit school sector may negatively affect public perceptions of for-profit educational institutions, including our institutions. In addition, in recent years, reports on student lending practices of various lending institutions and schools, including for-profit schools, and investigations by a number of state attorneys general, Congress and governmental agencies have led to adverse media coverage of postsecondary education. Adverse media coverage regarding others in our industry, or regarding us or our institutions directly, could damage our reputation, could result in lower enrollments at our institutions, lower revenue and increased expenses, and could have a negative impact on our stock price. Such allegations could also result in increased scrutiny and regulation by ED, Congress, accrediting bodies, state legislatures, state attorneys general, or other governmental authorities with respect to all for-profit institutions, including us and our institutions.\nRisks Related to Owning our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile, and as a result returns on an investment in our common stock may be volatile.\nFor a significant portion of the time since our initial public offering, we have had relatively limited public float, and trading in our common stock has also been limited and, at times, volatile. An active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained, and the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of, but not be limited to, some or all of the following:\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of comparable companies;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our earnings, our institutions\u2019 enrollments or net course registrations, or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of securities analysts;\n\u2022\nthe actual, anticipated or perceived impact of changes in the political environment, government policies, laws and regulations, or similar changes made by accrediting bodies;\n\u2022\nthe depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and trends;\n\u2022\ncatastrophic events;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our stock; or\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Because of the potential volatility of our stock price, we may become the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and monetary damages and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nSeasonal and other fluctuations in our results of operations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly results fluctuate and, therefore, the results in any quarter may not represent the results we may achieve in any subsequent quarter or full year. Our revenue and operating results normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal or other variations in our institutions\u2019 enrollments and associated expenses. Student population at our institutions varies as a result of new enrollments, graduations, student attrition, the success of our marketing programs, and other reasons that we cannot always anticipate. We expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns at our institutions and related fluctuations in expenses. These fluctuations may result in volatility in our results of operations, have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, or both.\nProvisions in our organizational documents and in the Delaware General Corporation Law may prevent takeover attempts that could be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions in our charter and bylaws and in the Delaware General Corporation Law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a takeover attempt we oppose even if a change in control of our Company would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the powers, preferences, and rights of each series without stockholder approval, which may discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our Company;\n\u2022\na requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of their intention to nominate a director or to propose any other business at an annual meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\na prohibition against stockholder action by means of written consent unless otherwise approved by our Board of Directors in advance; and\n\u2022\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits us from engaging in mergers and other business combinations with stockholders that beneficially own 15% or more of our voting stock, or with their affiliates, unless our directors or stockholders approve the business combination in the prescribed manner.", "PERMNO": 92428, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "APEI"}
