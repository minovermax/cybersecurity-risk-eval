{"cik": "215466", "company": "Coeur Mining, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and operating costs are highly dependent upon the market prices of gold, silver, zinc and lead, and of key input commodities used in our business, which are volatile and beyond the Company\u2019s control.\nGold, silver, zinc and lead are actively traded commodities, and their prices are volatile. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the high and low price for each commodity are set forth in the following table:\nGold, silver, zinc and lead prices are affected by many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control, including U.S. dollar strength or weakness, speculation, global currency values, the price of products that incorporate gold, silver, zinc or lead, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. In addition, Exchange Traded Funds (\u201cETFs\u201d), which have substantially facilitated the ability of large and small investors to buy and sell precious metals and base metals, have become significant holders of gold, silver, zinc and lead. Gold and silver prices are also affected by prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations regarding inflation and governmental decisions regarding precious metals stockpiles.\nBecause the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues from sales of gold, silver, zinc and lead, its results of operations and cash flows will fluctuate as the prices of these metals change. A period of significant and sustained lower gold and silver prices and, to a lesser extent, zinc and lead prices, would materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows. In response to lower metal price and/or higher treatment and refining charge environments, the Company may have to revise its operating plans, including reducing operating costs and capital expenditures, terminating or suspending mining operations at one or more of its properties and discontinuing certain exploration and development plans. These types of initiatives may not sufficiently offset reductions in revenues, and the Company may continue to incur losses associated with sustained lower metals prices.\nOperating costs at the Company\u2019s mines are also affected by the price of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel and concrete. Prices for these input commodities are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, currency fluctuations, consumer or industrial demand and other factors. Continued volatility in the prices of commodities and other supplies the Company purchases could lead to higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.\nThe estimation of mineral reserves and mineralized material is imprecise and depends upon subjective factors. Estimated mineral reserves and mineralized material may not be realized in actual production. The Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected by inaccurate estimates.\nThe mineral reserve and mineralized material figures presented in the Company\u2019s public filings are estimates made by the Company\u2019s technical personnel and independent mining consultants with whom the Company contracts. Mineral reserve and mineralized material estimates are a function of geological and engineering analyses that require the Company to make assumptions about production costs, recoveries and gold, silver, zinc and lead market prices. Mineral reserve and mineralized material estimation is an imprecise and subjective process. The accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation, judgment and experience. Assumptions about gold, silver, zinc and lead market prices are subject to great uncertainty as those prices fluctuate widely and have fallen significantly at times over the past several years. Declines in the market prices of gold, silver, zinc or lead may render mineral reserves and mineralized material containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit, and the Company may be required to reduce mineral reserve and mineralized material estimates, discontinue development or mining at one or more of its properties or write down assets as impaired. Should the Company encounter mineralization or geologic formations at any of its mines or projects different from those predicted, it may adjust its mineral reserve and mineralized material estimates and alter its mining plans. Either of these alternatives may adversely affect actual production and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA significant delay or disruption in sales of concentrates or dor\u00e9 as a result of the unexpected disruption in services provided by smelters or refiners or other third parties could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.\nThe Company relies on refiners and smelters to refine and process and, in some cases, purchase, the gold and silver dor\u00e9 and gold, silver, zinc and lead concentrate produced by the Company\u2019s mines. Access to refiners and smelters on economical terms is critical to the Company\u2019s ability to sell its products to buyers and generate revenues. The Company has existing agreements with refiners and smelters, some of which operate their refining or smelting facilities outside the United States, and the Company believes it currently has contractual arrangements with a sufficient number of refiners and smelters so that the loss of any one refiner or smelter would not significantly or materially impact the Company\u2019s operations or its ability to generate revenues. Nevertheless, services provided by a refiner or smelter may be disrupted by new or increased tariffs, duties or other cross-border trade barriers, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more refiners or smelters or the inability to agree on acceptable commercial or legal terms with a refiner or smelter. Such an event or events may disrupt an existing relationship with a refiner or smelter or result in the inability to create a contractual relationship with a refiner or smelter, which may leave the Company with limited, uneconomical or no access to refining or smelting services for short or long periods of time. Epidemics, pandemics or natural disasters may also impact refiners, smelters or other third parties with whom the Company has contractual arrangements or have an indirect effect on the Company's ability to obtain refining, smelting or other third party services. In early 2020, the Coronavirus outbreak has resulted in logistical constraints throughout China, including limiting zinc and lead smelting capacity. While the Company currently has no direct contractual arrangements with Chinese smelters, the reduced smelting capacity in China has increased competition for smelting services provided in other jurisdictions. This may lead to even higher global treatment charges for lead and zinc and/or the inability of the Company to find sufficient smelting capacity for its zinc or lead production on reasonable terms or at all.\nAny delay or loss of access to refiners or smelters may significantly impact the Company\u2019s ability to sell its dor\u00e9 and concentrate products and generate revenues. The Company cannot ensure that alternative refiners or smelters would be available or offer comparable terms if the need for them were to arise or that it would not experience delays or disruptions in sales that would materially and adversely affect results of operations.\nIn November 2018, one of the refiners of the Company's dore, RMC, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. While the Company was able to divert shipments to alternative refiners following the bankruptcy filing, approximately 0.4 million ounces of the Company's silver and 6,500 ounces of the Company's gold were impacted by RMC's bankruptcy filing. In 2019, the Company entered into a partial settlement with RMC and certain other interested parties with respect to certain of its claims to this material; however, the Company did not recover the full value of the material, resulting in a write-down of the receivable balance in the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRefining charges and other fees charged by refiners and smelters may increase which may reduce the net revenues realized from production at our mines. For example, treatment charges for lead and zinc smelting have increased considerably since Coeur acquired the Silvertip mine in late 2017 due primarily to oversupply of lead and zinc, increasing costs and reducing the net proceeds from lead and zinc sales. The Silvertip mine is party to long-term lead and zinc concentrate sales agreements which provide discounts on lead and zinc treatment charges but require the Company to deliver all lead and zinc production to a single buyer until stated minimum quantities are met. Because most of the lead and all of the zinc produced by the Silvertip mine since the Company\u2019s acquisition of Silvertip have not met minimum specifications for lead and zinc required under these long-term agreements, the Company has been exposed to market treatment charges which, in most cases, have been higher than the chargers applicable to the long-term agreements.\nThere are significant hazards associated with mining activities, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance.\nThe mining business is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions or machine failure, such as the failure of the secondary crusher in Rochester\u2019s new crushing circuit in 2019, which impacted crushing rates. These occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced production and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability.\nInsurance fully covering many environmental risks, including potential liability for pollution or other hazards as a result of disposal of waste products occurring from exploration and production, is not generally available. Any liabilities that the Company incurs for these risks and hazards could be significant and could adversely affect results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\nThe Company may be unable to successfully integrate and may not realize the expected benefits of recent or future acquisitions.\nThere can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of recent acquisitions (including the Silvertip mine and the Sterling and Lincoln Hill projects) or any future acquisition, will be realized on the originally-anticipated timeline or at all. The success and the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition will depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to effectively manage the integration, performance and operations of entities or properties it acquires. The process of managing acquired businesses or assets may involve unforeseen challenges and may require a disproportionate amount of Company resources, which may divert focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and/or from operational matters during this process. As an example, the ramp up of the Silvertip mine, acquired in late 2017, has been slower and less profitable than originally anticipated, due primarily to more significant mill availability and maintenance challenges than were anticipated at the time Silvertip was acquired.\nIn addition to the above, any acquisition would be accompanied by risks, including:\n\u2022\na significant change in macroeconomic conditions, including commodity prices, treatment and refining charges or stock prices after the Company has committed to complete the transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio;\n\u2022\nadditional debt incurred or issued to fund some or all of acquisition consideration (as was the case with Silvertip and Wharf), resulting in increased interest expense and other borrowing costs;\n\u2022\nissuance of equity securities as acquisition consideration (which occurred in the Sterling, Lincoln Hill and Silvertip project acquisitions), resulting in dilution of existing Company stockholders;\n\u2022\na material ore body may prove to be below expectations;\n\u2022\nprocessing facilities may not operate as well as anticipated, and may require significant maintenance, downtime and capital investment, such as the mill at Silvertip;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise, and maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization\n\u2022\ndifficulties or loss of social license to operate resulting from failure of efforts to establish positive relationships and/or agreements with local communities or local indigenous people; and\n\u2022\nthe acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant.\nThe Company cannot predict the impact of future acquisitions on the price of its common stock or assure that it would be able to obtain necessary acquisition or development financing on acceptable terms or at all. Unprofitable acquisitions, or additional indebtedness or issuances of securities in connection with such acquisitions or any future mine development, may negatively affect results of operations.\nFinally, the Company\u2019s systems, procedures and controls may be inadequate to support the expansion of our operations resulting from an acquisition or development of a new mine. The Company\u2019s future operating results could be affected by the ability of its officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and integrate an acquired business or new operation into Coeur. There may also be liabilities, such as environmental liabilities, or significant capital expenditures that the Company failed to discover or have underestimated in connection with any acquisition or development. Any such liabilities or capital expenditure requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or future prospects.\nSignificant investment risks and operational costs are associated with exploration and development activities. These risks and costs may result in lower economic returns and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to sustain or increase its present production levels depends in part on successful exploration and development of new ore bodies and expansion of existing mining operations. Substantial expenditures are required to establish ore reserves, to extract metals from ores and, in the case of new properties, to construct mining and processing facilities.\nOur plans include several significant projects to construct or upgrade mining and processing facilities at our existing mining operations, including the Plan of Operations Amendment (\u201cPOA\u201d) 11 and POA 1 (each, as defined below) planned expansions and future plans to develop the Sterling and Lincoln Hill projects. These projects can take up to several months or years to complete, are complex and require significant capital expenditures. These projects are subject to significant risks, including delays, extreme weather events, unexpected increases in the cost of required materials, and disputes with third party providers of\nmaterials, equipment or services, and a completed project may not yield the anticipated operational or financial benefit, any of which may have a material negative impact on returns on invested capital, operating costs or cash flows.\nMineral exploration involves many risks and is frequently unproductive. Even if mineral deposits are found, those deposits may be insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production, or it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. The commercial viability of a mineral deposit, once developed, depends on a number of factors, including: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; government regulations including taxes, royalties and land tenure; land use; importing and exporting of minerals; environmental protection; mineral prices; and issuance and maintenance of necessary permits. Factors that affect adequacy of infrastructure include: reliability of roads, bridges, power sources and water supply; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena; sabotage; and government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure. All of these factors are highly cyclical. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.\nIn addition, exploration projects, such as the Company\u2019s La Preciosa, Sterling/Crown and Lincoln Hill projects may have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future operating costs and capital requirements. Exploration project items such as estimates of reserves, metal recoveries and cash operating costs are to a large extent based upon the interpretation of geologic data, obtained from a limited number of drill holes and other sampling techniques, and feasibility studies. Estimates of operating costs are then derived based upon anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed, the configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of metals from the ore, comparable facility and equipment costs, anticipated climate conditions and other factors. As a result, actual operating costs and economic returns of any and all exploration projects may materially differ from the costs and returns estimated, and accordingly, the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.\nThe Company\u2019s future growth will depend upon its ability to expand existing mines and develop and start-up new mines, either through exploration at existing properties or by acquisition of other mining companies.\nBecause mines have limited lives based on proven and probable mineral reserves, the Company\u2019s ability to achieve significant additional growth in revenues and cash flows will depend upon success in further developing and expanding existing properties and the opportunistic acquisition or development and start-up of new mining properties, such as the Silvertip mine, the Sterling/Crown project and the Lincoln Hill and related assets.\nWhile initial development of the Palmarejo, Rochester, and Kensington mines has been substantially completed, development work continues to expand these mines while leveraging existing infrastructure. In recent years, Palmarejo completed open pit mining and developed two new underground mining operations. At Rochester, a crushing circuit using high pressure grinding roll technology was commissioned in 2019 and planning and permitting is currently underway for a significant additional expansion, including the construction of two new leach pads, two new processing facilities and crushing systems (\u201cPOA 11\u201d). At Kensington, the Company completed development and commenced commercial production from a new deposit in 2018 and is currently seeking to amend its operating permit to expand the operation to allow for mining activities for an additional 10 years (\u201cPOA 1\u201d). The Company\u2019s ability to timely complete these and future mine expansion and mine life extension projects is dependent on numerous factors, many of which are outside of the Company\u2019s control, including, among others, availability of funding on acceptable terms and timing of receipt of permits and approvals from regulatory authorities. The Company cannot provide assurance that it will be able to successfully expand existing mining operations.\nIn addition, the Company acquired several mining properties in recent years, namely, the Sterling/Crown project, the Lincoln Hill and related assets and the Silvertip mine. The Company cannot assure that it will be able to successfully develop and start-up new mining properties or acquire additional mining properties on favorable economic terms or at all.\nThe Company regularly evaluates and engages in discussions or negotiations regarding acquisition opportunities. Any transactions that the Company contemplates or pursues would involve risks and uncertainties and would be subject to competition from other mining companies. There can be no assurance with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction.\nThe Company may be required to write down certain of its long-lived assets, due to metal prices, operational challenges or other factors. Such write- downs may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets for recoverability pursuant to the Financial Accounting Standard Board\u2019s Accounting Standards Codification Section 360. Under that standard, the Company reviews the recoverability of its long-lived assets, such as its mining properties, upon a triggering event. Such review involves the Company estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Impairment, measured by comparing an asset\u2019s carrying value to its fair value, must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows. The Company\nconducts a review of the financial performance of its mines in connection with the preparation of its financial statements for each reported period and determines whether any triggering events are indicated.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company performed a comprehensive analysis of its Silvertip property and determined that indicators of impairment existed, primarily as a result of continued deterioration in zinc and lead market conditions as well as ongoing challenges related to the processing facility. As a result of the impairment indicators, a recoverability test was performed and the Company concluded that the carrying value of the long-lived assets for the Silvertip property was impaired. A non-cash impairment charge of $250.8 million was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2019. The write-down was allocated between Property, plant and equipment, net, Mining properties, net and Other non-current assets, in the amounts of $43.6 million, $201.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively. See Note 4 -- Impairment of Long-lived Assets and 16 -- Fair Value Measurements for additional detail of the assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the long-lived assets tested for impairment. In prior years, the Company\u2019s assessment of the recoverability of its long-lived assets resulted in other write-downs in the Company's Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and reduced the carrying value of Mining properties and Property, plant, and equipment on the Company\u2019s balance sheet. See Note 2 -- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further detail.\nIf there are further significant and sustained declines in relevant metal prices, or if the Company fails to control production and operating costs or realize the mineable ore reserves at its mining properties, the Company may terminate or suspend mining operations at one or more of its properties. These events could require a further write-down of the carrying value of the Company\u2019s assets. Any such actions would adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may record other types of charges in the future if it sells a property or asset for a price less than it\u2019s carrying value or has to increase reclamation liabilities in connection with the closure and reclamation of a property. Any additional write-downs of mining properties or other assets could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company is an international company and is exposed to political and social risks associated with its foreign operations.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenues are generated by operations outside the United States. Exploration, development, production and closure activities in many countries are potentially subject to heightened political and social risks that are beyond the Company\u2019s control and could result in increased costs, capacity constraints and potential disruptions to the Company\u2019s business. These risks include the possible unilateral cancellation or forced renegotiation of contracts in which the Company, directly or indirectly, may have an interest, unfavorable changes in foreign laws and regulations, royalty and tax increases (including taxes associated with the import or export of goods), risks associated with the value-added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d) and income tax refund recovery and collection process, erection of trade barriers, including tariffs and duties, claims by governmental entities or indigenous communities, expropriation or nationalization of property and other risks arising out of foreign sovereignty over areas in which our operations are conducted. As an example, as disclosed in Note 21 -- Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is currently engaged in efforts to recover VAT paid to the Mexican government that is owed to Coeur associated with Coeur Mexicana\u2019s prior royalty agreement, including through ongoing litigation. The right to import and export gold, silver, zinc and lead may depend on obtaining certain licenses and quotas, which could be delayed or denied at the discretion of the relevant regulatory authorities, or could become subject to new taxes, tariffs or duties imposed by U.S. or foreign jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or future prospects. In addition, the Company\u2019s rights under local law may be less secure in countries where judicial systems are susceptible to manipulation and intimidation by government agencies, non-governmental organizations or civic groups.\nAny of these developments could require the Company to curtail or terminate operations at its mines, incur significant costs to renegotiate contracts, meet newly-imposed environmental or other standards, pay greater royalties or higher prices for labor or services and recognize higher taxes, or experience significant delays or obstacles in the recovery of VAT or income tax refunds owed, which could materially and adversely affect financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operational risks.\nThe Company\u2019s operations outside the United States also expose it to economic and operational risks. Local economic conditions, as well as epidemics, pandemics or natural disasters, can cause shortages of skilled workers and supplies, increase costs and adversely affect the security of operations. In addition, higher incidences of criminal activity and violence in the area of some of the Company\u2019s foreign operations, including drug-cartel related violence in Mexico, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to operate in an optimal fashion and may impose greater risks of theft and greater risks as to personnel and property security. These conditions could lead to lower productivity and higher costs, which would adversely affect results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, acts of civil disobedience are not uncommon in areas in Mexico where the Company\u2019s operations or projects are located. In recent years, many mining companies have been the targets of actions to restrict their legally-entitled access to mining concessions or property. Such acts of civil disobedience often occur with no warning and can result in significant direct\nand indirect costs. The Company cannot provide assurance that there will be no disruptions to site access in the future, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company sells silver and gold dor\u00e9, gold concentrate, and silver, zinc and lead concentrates in U.S. dollars, but it conducts operations outside the United States in local currency. Currency exchange movements could also adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends on developing and maintaining relationships with local communities and other stakeholders.\nThe Company\u2019s ongoing and future success depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with the communities surrounding its operations, including indigenous peoples who may have rights or may assert rights to certain of the Company\u2019s properties, and other stakeholders in its operating locations. The Company believes its operations can provide valuable benefits to surrounding communities, in terms of direct employment, training and skills development and other benefits associated with ongoing payment of taxes. In addition, the Company seeks to maintain its partnerships and relationships with local communities, including indigenous peoples, and stakeholders in a variety of ways, including in-kind contributions, volunteer time, sponsorships and donations. Notwithstanding the Company\u2019s ongoing efforts, local communities and stakeholders can become dissatisfied with its activities or the level of benefits provided, which may result in legal or administrative proceedings, civil unrest, protests, direct action or campaigns against it. Any such occurrences could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLike any mining company, our mining assets are subject to geotechnical and hydrological risks, and a related incident could materially and adversely impact our production, profitability and financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nOur mining assets are subject to geotechnical and hydrological risks which could impact the structural integrity of our mines, stockpiles, leach pads and tailings storage facilities. No assurances can be given that unanticipated adverse geotechnical and hydrological conditions, such as landslides, pit wall failures or tailings dam instability will not occur in the future or that such events will be detected in advance. Geotechnical and hydrological instabilities can be difficult to predict and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control, such as severe weather and considerable rainfall, which may lead to periodic floods, mudslides, wall instability and seismic activity, which may result in slippage of material. Waste rock in the form of tailings generated as a by-product of processed ore is produced at the Kensington, Palmarejo, and Silvertip Mines. Coeur places tailings into engineered containments, underground as structural backfill, and as a dry stack material. In response to several recent tailings dam failures unrelated to Coeur that have involved loss of life and resulted in severe property and environmental ecosystem damage, Coeur completed a comprehensive review of its tailings dams and operational practices to characterize its risk profile. Coeur concluded that its tailings dams represent a low exposure risk profile for several reasons, including that our tailings dams were constructed using construction methods recognized in the industry as the most stable tailings dam design using high strength and chemically stable rock in construction. Our dams are continuously monitored and inspected by internal resources as well as third party industry qualified experts. The significant dam failure events that have occurred in recent years may lead to regulatory governance changes stemming from updated laws, regulation or guidance, which could result in increased operational and compliance costs if we need to make changes to existing facilities. The failure of a tailings dam or tailings storage facility at one of our mine sites could result in severe, and in some cases catastrophic, property and environmental damage and loss of life. Geotechnical or hydrological failures could result in limited or restricted access to mine sites, suspension of operations, government investigations, lawsuits filed by parties who suffer injuries or property damage from such events, increased monitoring costs, remediation costs, loss of mineralized material and other impacts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position as well as the value of our common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s estimates of future production, costs, and financial results are imprecise, depend upon subjective factors, may not be realized in actual production and such estimates speak only as of their respective dates.\nThe Company has in the past, and may in the future, provide estimates and projections of its future production, costs and financial results. Any such information is forward-looking. Neither the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines these forward-looking statements and, accordingly, do not express any opinion or any other form of assurance on these estimates and projections. Estimates and projections are made by the Company\u2019s management and technical personnel and are qualified by, and subject to the assumptions contained or referred in the filing, release or presentation in which they are made, including assumptions about the availability, accessibility, sufficiency and quality of mineralized material, the Company\u2019s costs of production, the market prices of gold, silver, zinc and lead, the Company\u2019s ability to sustain and increase production levels, the ability to produce and sell marketable concentrates and dor\u00e9 and related treatment and refining charges, the sufficiency of its infrastructure, the performance of its personnel and equipment, its ability to maintain and obtain mining interests and permits, the state of government and community relations, and its compliance with existing and future laws and regulations. The Company sometimes states possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed, but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. Actual results and experience may differ materially from these assumptions. Any production, cost, or financial results estimates speak only as of the date on which they are made, and the Company disclaims any intent or\nobligation to update such estimates, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, these forward-looking statements should be considered in the context in which they are made and undue reliance should not be placed on them.\nForward sales, advance sales, royalty arrangements, and certain derivative instruments can result in limiting the Company\u2019s ability to take advantage of increased metal prices while increasing its exposure to lower metal prices.\nThe Company has in the past entered into, and may in the future enter into, arrangements under which it (or a mine acquired by the Company) has agreed to make advance metal sales to third parties or royalty or similar payments to lenders or other third parties in amounts that are based on expected production and price levels for gold or silver. The Company enters into such arrangements when it concludes that they provide it with necessary capital to develop a specific mining property or to achieve other business objectives. Advance metal sales, and royalty or similar payment obligations, however, can limit the Company\u2019s ability to realize the full effects of rising metal prices and may, depending on the terms of the agreement, require the Company to make potentially significant cash payments if the mine fails to achieve specified minimum production levels or delivery requirements.\nThe Company is dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to cybersecurity incidents, disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.\nThe Company\u2019s information technology systems used in its operations are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyberattacks, natural disasters and defects in design. Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or machines and equipment, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, the corruption of data or the disabling, misuse or malfunction of machines and equipment. Various measures have been implemented to manage the Company\u2019s risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information or operational technology disruptions, the Company could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, operating accidents, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage the risks related to the system implementation and modification, but system modification failures could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on good relations with, and the retention and hiring of, employees.\nThe Company may experience labor disputes, work stoppages or other disruptions in production that could adversely affect its business and results of operations. Labor disruptions may be used to advocate labor, political or social goals, particularly at non-U.S. mines. For example, labor disruptions may occur in sympathy with strikes or labor unrest in other sectors of local economies. The Company cannot assure that work stoppages, union organizing activities or other disruptions will not occur in the future. Any such work stoppage or disruption could expose the Company to significant costs and have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe compete with other mining companies to attract and retain key executives, skilled labor, contractors and other employees. We may be unable to continue to attract and retain skilled and experienced employees, which could have an adverse effect on our competitive position or adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition.\nContinuation of the Company\u2019s mining operations is dependent on the availability of sufficient and affordable water supplies.\nThe Company\u2019s mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. In particular, the Company\u2019s properties in Mexico and Nevada are in areas where water is scarce and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production and mine development is dependent on the Company\u2019s ability to acquire and maintain water rights and claims and to defeat claims adverse to current water uses in legal proceedings. Although each of the Company\u2019s operating mines currently has sufficient water rights and claims to cover its operational demands, the Company cannot predict the potential outcome of pending or future legal proceedings relating to water rights, claims and uses. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts out of the Company\u2019s control. Shortages in water supply could result in production and processing interruptions. In addition, the scarcity of water in certain regions could result in increased costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water to conduct the Company\u2019s operations. The loss of some or all water rights, in whole or in part, or ongoing shortages of water to which we have rights or significantly higher costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water (or the failure to procure sufficient quantities of water) could result in the Company\u2019s inability to maintain production at current or expected levels, require the Company to curtail or shut down mining production and could prevent the Company from pursuing expansion or development opportunities, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations\nand financial condition. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which the Company operates which could also limit access to sufficient water resources, thus adversely affecting the Company\u2019s operations.\nWe may not be able to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets\nThe Company has accrued deferred tax assets in various jurisdictions from past operating losses, however, we may not be able to utilize part or all of these assets in the future. We only recognize the expected future tax benefit from these assets if it is considered more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be utilized. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income, including application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction, assumptions about future metals prices, the macroeconomic environment and results of the Company\u2019s operations. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the Company\u2019s ability to realize deferred tax assets could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to obtain the future benefits represented by our deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets in the United States are also subject to limitation if the Company experiences a change in stock ownership in accordance with Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Management has determined that the Company experienced ownership changes, for purposes of Section 382, during 2002, 2003, 2007, and 2015. Based on management\u2019s calculations, the Company does not expect any of its deferred tax assets to expire unused as a result of the Section 382 annual limitations. However, the annual limitations may impact the timeframe over which the net operating loss carryforwards can be used, potentially impacting cash tax liabilities in a future period.\nRISKS RELATED TO INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCING\nThe Company\u2019s future operating performance may not generate cash flows sufficient to meet debt payment obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $295.5 million of outstanding indebtedness. The Company\u2019s ability to make scheduled debt payments on outstanding indebtedness will depend on future results of operations and cash flows. The Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows, in part, are subject to economic factors beyond its control, including the market prices of gold, silver, zinc and lead. The Company may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet obligations and commitments under outstanding debt instruments.\nIf the Company\u2019s cash flows from operations are insufficient to fund its debt service obligations, the Company could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance its indebtedness. The Company cannot predict whether it would be able to refinance debt, issue equity or debt securities or dispose of assets to raise funds on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms. In a rising interest rate environment, the costs of borrowing additional funds or refinancing outstanding indebtedness would also be expected to increase. In addition, the Facility\u2019s (as defined below) interest rate is determined, at the Company\u2019s option, by the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), and the Company and its lenders may not be able to agree to a new benchmark interest rate before LIBOR is expected to be eliminated by the end of 2021, which may result in higher interest costs for the Company. The agreements governing the Company\u2019s outstanding indebtedness restrict the Company\u2019s ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict its ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. The Company may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, holders of its common stock could experience significant dilution of their ownership interest, and these securities could have rights senior to those of the holders of common stock.\nThe terms of the Company\u2019s debt impose restrictions on its operations.\nThe agreements governing the Company\u2019s outstanding indebtedness include a number of significant negative covenants. These covenants, among other things:\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing, repurchase outstanding equity or issue debt securities;\n\u2022\nrequire the Company to meet certain financial covenants consisting of a consolidated net leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio;\n\u2022\nrequire a portion of the Company\u2019s cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, which reduces the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets, enter into transactions with and invest capital in affiliates, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends, consolidate, amalgamate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit the Company\u2019s flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete; and\n\u2022\nplace the Company at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement governing the Company\u2019s outstanding indebtedness that, if not cured or waived, could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any debt could result in cross-defaults under the Company\u2019s other debt instruments. The Company\u2019s inability to meet any of these covenants may also result in a lender requiring the Company to agree to additional restrictive covenants which may, among other things, limit its ability to fund its existing operations or incur additional indebtedness. The Company\u2019s assets and cash flow may be insufficient to repay borrowings fully under all of its outstanding debt instruments if any of its debt instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, which could force the Company into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nAny downgrade in the credit ratings assigned to the Company or its debt securities could increase future borrowing costs, adversely affect the availability of new financing and may result in increased collateral requirements under the Company\u2019s existing surety bond portfolio.\nThere can be no assurance that any rating currently assigned by Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services or Moody\u2019s Investors Service to the Company or its debt securities will remain unchanged for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. If the Company is unable to maintain its outstanding debt and financial ratios at levels acceptable to the credit rating agencies, or should the Company\u2019s business prospects or financial results deteriorate, including as a result of declines in gold and silver prices or other factors beyond our control, our ratings could be downgraded by the rating agencies. A downgrade by the rating agencies could adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s outstanding debt securities, its existing debt, and its ability to obtain new financing on favorable terms, if at all, increase borrowing costs, and may result in increased collateral requirements under the Company\u2019s existing surety bond portfolio, which in turn may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company\u2019s use of derivative contracts to protect against market price volatility exposes it to risk of opportunity loss, mark- to-market fair value adjustments and exposure to counterparty credit risk.\nFrom time to time, the Company may enter into price risk management contracts to protect against fluctuations in the price of gold, silver, zinc and lead, foreign currency rates and changes in the prices of fuel and other input costs. These contracts could include forward sales or purchase contracts, futures contracts, purchased or sold put and call options and other derivative instruments. In 2019 and early 2020, the Company entered into price risk management contracts on a portion of its gold production for 2019 and 2020 after a significant increase in gold prices during 2019 and into early 2020. The Company determined to implement these contracts to provide for a minimum level of revenue from the sales of the covered gold ounces in order to mitigate the risk of not being able to fund all or a portion of the costs of several projects at existing operations.\nThe use of derivative instruments can expose the Company to risk of an opportunity loss and may also result in significant mark-to-market fair value adjustments, which may have a material adverse impact on reported financial results. The Company is exposed to credit risk with contract counterparties, including, but not limited to, sales contracts and derivative contracts. In the event of nonperformance in connection with a contract, the Company could be exposed to a loss of value for that contract.\nRISKS RELATED TO APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS\nThe Company is subject to significant governmental regulations, including the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Act, the Health, Safety and Reclamation Code for Mines under the British Columbia Mines Act and Relevant Sections of the Mexican Official Regulations, and related costs and delays may negatively affect its business.\nMining activities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing environmental protection, natural resources, prospecting, development, production, post-closure reclamation, taxes, labor standards and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including mine safety, toxic substances and other matters. The costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations are substantial. Changes in existing laws, possible future laws and regulations, or more restrictive interpretations of current laws and regulations by governmental authorities, could cause additional expense, capital expenditures, restrictions on or suspensions of operations and delays in the development of new properties.\nU.S. surface and underground mines like the Kensington, Rochester and Wharf mines and Sterling/Crown project are frequently inspected by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (\u201cMSHA\u201d), which inspections often lead to notices of violation. Recently, MSHA has been conducting more frequent and more comprehensive inspections of mining operations in general. Similar inspections are conducted in British Columbia, Canada, at the Silvertip mine and in Mexico at the Palmarejo complex by the British Columbia Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources and the Mexican Secretaria del Trabajo y Prevision Social (Secretary of Labor and Social Safety), respectively.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in temporary or extended shutdowns, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, which may\nrequire corrective measures including the payment of fines or penalties, capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nCompliance with environmental regulations and litigation based on environmental regulations could require significant expenditures.\nEnvironmental regulations mandate, among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards, land development and land reclamation, and set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that may require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for mining companies and their officers, directors and employees. The Company may incur environmental costs that could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to remedy an environmental problem could require it to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy. The environmental standards that ultimately may be imposed at a mine site affect the cost of remediation and could exceed the financial accruals that the Company has made for such remediation. The potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of prior and current operations, including operations conducted by other mining companies many years ago at sites located on properties that the Company currently or formerly owned. These lawsuits could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, remediation costs, penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions. Substantial costs and liabilities, including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines, are inherent in the Company\u2019s operations. The Company cannot assure that any such law, regulation, enforcement or private claim would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nSome of the mining wastes from the Company\u2019s U.S. mines currently are exempt to a limited extent from the extensive set of EPA regulations governing hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\u201cRCRA\u201d). If the EPA were to repeal this exemption, and designate these mining wastes as hazardous under RCRA, the Company would be required to expend additional amounts on the handling of such wastes and to make significant expenditures to construct hazardous waste storage or disposal facilities. Under the Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008 (\u201cMEBA\u201d), incidental elemental mercury generated at the Company's Rochester mine as part of the processing of ore may not be exported outside of the United States and is required to be stored in a storage facility designated by the U.S. Department of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d). Near the end of 2019, the DOE designated a facility and issued a long-term management and storage fee rule; however, the facility designation process and fee are currently subject to legal challenge by the Company and other third parties. If litigation is unsuccessful, the existing rule could result in material cost being incurred to ship and store Coeur Rochester's mercury. In addition, if any of these wastes causes contamination in or damage to the environment at a U.S. mining facility, that facility could be designated as a \u201cSuperfund\u201d site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d). Under CERCLA, any present owner or operator of a Superfund site or the owner or operator at the time of contamination may be held jointly and severally liable regardless of fault and may be forced to undertake extensive remedial cleanup action or to pay for the cleanup efforts. The owner or operator also may be liable to federal, state and tribal governmental entities for the cost of damages to natural resources, which could be substantial. Additional regulations or requirements also are imposed on the Company\u2019s tailings and waste disposal areas in Alaska under the federal Clean Water Act (\u201cCWA\u201d), in Nevada under the Nevada Water Pollution Control Law which implements the CWA, and in South Dakota under the South Dakota Water Pollution Control Act and the Administrative Rules of the State of South Dakota. In addition, proposed CERCLA regulations requiring mining companies to obtain supplemental financial assurance could, if adopted, have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.\nAirborne emissions are subject to controls under air pollution statutes implementing the Clean Air Act in Nevada, Alaska and South Dakota. In addition, there are numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives related to climate change, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, or energy policy and adoption of these initiatives through legislative actions or administrative policy could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, U.S. environmental conservation efforts could result in the withdrawal of certain federal lands from mineral entry under the Mining Law, which could have the effect of restricting the Company\u2019s current or future planned activities involving its unpatented mining claims on the affected public lands.\nThe Company is required to obtain and renew governmental permits in order to conduct operations, a process which is often costly and time-consuming. The Company\u2019s ability to obtain necessary government permits to expand operations or begin new operations may be materially affected by third party activists.\nIn the normal course of its business, the Company is required to obtain and renew governmental permits for exploration, operations and expansion of existing operations and for the development of new projects, such as the permitting efforts currently underway for POA 11 at Rochester and POA 1 at Kensington. Obtaining and renewing governmental permits is a complex and\ntime-consuming process. The timeliness and success of permitting efforts are contingent upon many variables not within the Company\u2019s control, including the interpretation of permit approval requirements administered by the applicable permitting authority. The Company may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to its operations or the cost and time required to obtain or renew permits may exceed the Company\u2019s expectations. Any unexpected delays or costs associated with the permitting process could delay the development or impede the operation of a mine, which in turn could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and future growth. In addition, key permits and approvals may be revoked or suspended or may be changed in a manner that adversely affects the Company\u2019s operations.\nPrivate parties such as environmental activists frequently attempt to intervene in the permitting process and to persuade regulators to deny necessary permits or seek to overturn permits that have been issued. Obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time-consuming process involving numerous jurisdictions and often involving public hearings and costly undertakings. These third party actions can materially increase the costs and cause delays in the permitting process and could cause the Company to not proceed with the development or expansion of a mine. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to successfully obtain key permits and approvals to explore for, develop, operate and expand mines and to conduct its operations will likely depend on the Company\u2019s ability to develop, operate, expand and close mines in a manner that is consistent with the creation of social and economic benefits in the surrounding communities, which may or may not be required by law. The Company\u2019s ability to obtain permits and approvals and to successfully operate in particular communities may be adversely impacted by real or perceived detrimental events associated with its activities or those of other mining companies affecting the environment, human health and safety of communities in which it operates.\nIf future permitting applications or amendments are not approved on a timely basis or at all, or if the permitting process is delayed for any reason, including to address public comments, the Company\u2019s plans for continued operations and future growth could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and reputational harm.\nThe Company operates in certain jurisdictions that have experienced governmental and private sector corruption. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as Canadian and Mexican anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, and loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage the Company\u2019s reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position and results of operations. The Company\u2019s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws; however, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s internal control policies and procedures always will protect it from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty or other inappropriate acts or violations of laws committed by the Company\u2019s affiliates, employees or agents.\nThe Company is subject to litigation and may be subject to additional litigation in the future.\nThe Company is currently, and may in the future become, subject to other litigation, arbitration or proceedings with other parties. If decided adversely to the Company, these legal proceedings, or others that could be brought against the Company in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or prospects. In the event of a dispute arising at the Company\u2019s foreign operations, the Company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral panels or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts or arbitral panels in the United States. The Company\u2019s inability to enforce its rights and the enforcement of rights on a prejudicial basis by foreign courts or arbitral panels could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nDisputes regarding the Company\u2019s mining claims, concessions or surface rights to land in the vicinity of the Company\u2019s mining projects could adversely impact operations.\nThe validity of mining or exploration claims, concessions or rights, which constitute most of the Company\u2019s property holdings, is often uncertain and may be contested. The Company has used commercially reasonable efforts, in accordance with industry standards, to investigate its title or claims to its various properties, however, no assurance can be given that applicable governments will not revoke or significantly alter the conditions of the applicable exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights or that such exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights will not be challenged by third parties. Although the Company has attempted to acquire satisfactory title to undeveloped properties, in accordance with mining industry practice it does not generally obtain title opinions until a decision is made to develop a property. As a result, some titles, particularly titles to undeveloped properties may be defective. Defective title to any of the Company\u2019s exploration and mining claims, concessions or rights could result in litigation, insurance claims and potential losses affecting its business as a whole. There may be challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising the Company\u2019s projects that, if successful, could impair development and operations.\nA defect could result in the Company losing all or a portion of its right, title, estate and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates.\nIn Mexico, while mineral rights are administered by the federal government through federally issued mining concessions, federally recognized agrarian communities called ejidos control surface or surface access rights to the land. An ejido may sell or lease lands directly to a private entity. While the Company has agreements or is in the process of negotiating agreements with the ejidos that impact all of its projects in Mexico, some of these agreements may be subject to renegotiation.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe Company has the ability to issue additional equity securities, including in connection with an acquisition of other companies, which would lead to dilution of its issued and outstanding common stock and may materially and adversely affect the price of its common stock.\nThe issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, whether to acquire new companies or businesses or for other strategic benefits, would result in dilution of the Company\u2019s existing stockholders\u2019 equity ownership. The Company is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, 10.0 million shares of preferred stock in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and relative participating, optional, conversion and other special rights of the shares of each series as well as the qualification, limitations or restrictions on each series. Any series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of its common stock. If the Company issues additional equity securities, the price of its common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\nHolders of our common stock may not receive dividends.\nWe have not historically declared cash dividends on our common stock. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. We are incorporated in Delaware and governed by the Delaware General Corporation Law. Delaware law allows a corporation to pay dividends only out of surplus, as determined under Delaware law or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend was declared and for the preceding fiscal year. Under Delaware law, however, we cannot pay dividends out of net profits if, after we pay the dividend, our capital would be less than the capital represented by the outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets. Our ability to pay dividends will be subject to our future earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as our compliance with covenants related to existing or future indebtedness and would only be declared in the discretion of our Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 24441, "SIC": 1040, "TIC": "CDE"}
