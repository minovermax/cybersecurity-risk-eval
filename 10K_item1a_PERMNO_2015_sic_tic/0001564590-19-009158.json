RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider and read carefully all the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, business prospects, stock price, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The risks below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on us. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements, estimates and projections that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur business largely depends on the levels of exploration and development activity in the oil and natural gas industry, a historically cyclical industry. A decrease in this activity caused by low oil and natural gas prices, increased supply, and reduced demand, such as has occurred over the last several years, has had an adverse effect on our business, liquidity and results of operations.\nDemand for our services depends upon the level of spending by oil and natural gas companies for exploration, production, development and field management activities which depend, in part, on oil and natural gas supplies and prices. The markets for oil and natural gas have historically been volatile and are likely to continue to be so in the future. In addition to the market prices of oil and natural gas, our customers\u2019 willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which our management has no control. A decline in oil and natural gas exploration activities and commodity prices, as has occurred over the last several years, has adversely affected the demand for our services and our results of operations.\nFactors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas and our customers\u2019 desire to explore, develop and produce include:\n\u2022\nthe level of supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nexpectations about future prices for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe worldwide political, military and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to set and maintain production levels and prices for oil;\n\u2022\nthe rate of discovery of new oil and natural gas reserves and the decline of existing oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe ability of exploration and production companies to generate funds or otherwise obtain capital for exploration, development and production operations;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy exploration, production and consumption;\n\u2022\ngovernment policies, including environmental regulations and tax policies, regarding the exploration for, production and development of oil and natural gas reserves, the use of fossil fuels and alternative energy sources and climate change;\n\u2022\nweather conditions, including large-scale weather events such as hurricanes that affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area or affect prices; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the Alaskan oil and gas tax credit system which may significantly affect the level of exploration spending within Alaska and has negatively affected our current liquidity position.\nThe decreases in prices for oil and natural gas have led many E&P companies to reduce their capital expenditures, which has resulted in diminished demand for our services and products and downward pressure on the prices we charge or the level of work we do for our customers.\nWe cannot assure you that the exploration and development activities by our customers will be maintained at current levels. Any significant decline in exploration or production-related spending by our customers, whether due to a decrease in the prices for oil and natural gas or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, increases in oil and natural gas prices may not increase demand for our products and services or otherwise have a positive effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur revenues, operating results and cash flows can be subject to fluctuations from period to period.\nOur revenues, operating results and cash flows may fluctuate from period to period. Factors that cause variations include the timing of the receipt and commencement of contracts for seismic data acquisition, processing or interpretation and customers\u2019 budgetary cycles, all of which are beyond our control. In addition, in any given period, we could have idle crews which result in a significant portion of our revenues, cash flows and earnings coming from a relatively small number of crews. Lower crew utilization rates can be caused by land access permit and weather delays, seasonal factors such as holiday schedules, shorter winter days or agricultural or hunting seasons, and crew repositioning and crew utilization and productivity. Additionally, due to location, type of service or particular project, some of our individual crews may achieve results that constitute a significant percentage of our consolidated operating results. Should any of our crews experience changes in timing or delays due to one or more of these factors, our financial results could be subject to significant variations from period to period. Combined with our fixed costs, these revenue fluctuations could also produce unexpected adverse results of operations in any fiscal period.\nOil and natural gas prices, while showing improvement over the past year, have continued to be volatile and have resulted in significant demand fluctuations for our services. There can be no assurance of future oil and gas price levels or stability. The demand for our services will be adversely affected by a significant reduction in oil and natural gas prices and by climate change legislation or material changes to U.S. energy policy. Because our business has high fixed costs, the negative effect of one or more of these factors could trigger wide variations in our revenues, operating results and cash flows.\nIn addition to the above potential fluctuations in our revenue, we may also have significant third-party pass-through costs that are reflected in our revenues but correspond to a very small administrative margin charged to the customer. Therefore, our revenues for certain periods may include a large amount of these third-party charges and can cause our gross profit margin to be lower.\nOur profitability is determined, in part, by the utilization level and productivity of our crews and is affected by numerous external factors that are beyond our control.\nOur profitability is determined, in part, by the prices we receive for our services, the productivity of our crews and the accuracy of our cost estimates. The productivity of our crews is partly a function of external factors, such as client cancellation or delay of projects, operating delays from inclement weather, obtaining land access rights and other factors, over which we have no control. In addition, cost estimates for our projects may be inadequate due to unknown factors associated with the work to be performed and market conditions, resulting in cost over-runs. If our crews encounter operational difficulties or delays, or if we have not correctly priced our services, our results of operation may vary and, in some cases, may be adversely affected.\nOur projects are performed on both a (i) turnkey basis, where a defined amount and scope of work is provided by us for a fixed price and additional work, which is subject to customer approval, is billed separately, and (ii) term basis, where work is provided by us for a fixed hourly, daily or monthly fee. The relative mix of turnkey and term agreements, as related to our projects, can vary widely from time to time. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized on a turnkey contract can vary from our estimated amount because of changes in job conditions, variations in labor and equipment productivity from the original estimates, and the performance of subcontractors. In addition, if conditions exist on a particular project that were not anticipated in the customer contract, such as excessive weather delays, community issues, governmental issues or equipment failure, then the revenue timing and amount from a project can be affected substantially. Turnkey contracts may also cause us to bear substantially all of the risks of business interruption caused by weather delays and other hazards. Those variations, delays and risks inherent in billing customers at a fixed price may result in us experiencing reduced profitability or losses on projects.\nThe significant fixed costs of our operations could result in operating losses.\nWe are subject to significant fixed operating costs, which primarily consist of depreciation (a non-cash item) and maintenance expenses associated with our equipment, certain crew costs and interest expense on our outstanding indebtedness. Extended periods of significant downtime or low productivity caused by reduced demand, weather interruptions, equipment failures, permit delays or other causes could negatively affect our results and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations because we will not be able to reduce our fixed costs as fast as revenues decline.\nOur working capital needs are difficult to forecast and may vary significantly, which could cause liquidity issues and require us to seek additional financing that we may not be able to obtain on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nOur working capital needs are difficult to predict and can be subject to significant and rapid increases in our needs. Our available cash varies as a result of the timing of our projects, our customers\u2019 budgetary cycles and our receipt of payment. Our working capital requirements may continue to increase due to the expansion of infrastructure that may be required to keep pace with technological advances. In addition, some of our larger projects require significant upfront expenditures.\nOver time, we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities, as we have done by the acquisition of assets from GEOK. Even with the addition of these assets, we currently estimate that our capital expenditures for 2019 will not exceed $6.0 million, which is less than the $1.3 million we incurred in 2018. This amount will permit us to maintain the operational capability of our current fleet of equipment so that we can execute ongoing projects without delay or increased costs but will not allow us to purchase any new technology or upgrade existing capital assets.\nWe currently have $8.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our credit facility, but we cannot borrow this amount without consent of lenders holding 66 \u2154% of the aggregate of advances and commitments under our credit facility. In addition, we are also essentially at our borrowing limits under our senior loan facility and 6% Senior Secured Convertible Notes due 2023 (the \u201c2023 Notes\u201d). While currently we do not have a working capital facility, we anticipate that we may be able to put in place a modest working capital facility to cover our liquidity needs, including upfront expenditures for upcoming projects, but such a facility may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nThe most acute issue affecting our liquidity is the delay in receiving payments on our $52.8 million net receivable from one customer. Our liquidity and cash flows have been adversely affected by failure to receive payment on this receivable and may be further adversely affected by future events outside of our control relating to this receivable.\nWe continue to diligently pursue improving our capitalization and reducing our long-term debt, but liquidity issues may continue to challenge us. Until we are able to finally resolve the issues described above, we are likely to continue to experience liquidity and cash flow issues.\nWe face several risks regarding the collection of our largest accounts receivable and our related monetization efforts under Alaska\u2019s exploration tax credits (the \u201cTax Credits\u201d) program.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have a $52.8 million accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $19.0 million, from one customer. This is our single largest accounts receivable, constitutes the majority of our outstanding accounts receivable and is the largest single asset on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. We have classified this receivable as long-term because of the length of time we expect it will take to collect on it.\nIn 2018, our customer was successful in licensing and selling the seismic data and we received $3.6 million; however, at this time, we believe that it is unlikely that the customer will be able to fully satisfy the receivable directly. Our customer had historically relied on the monetization of Tax Credits, which monetization was accomplished by receipt of payments from Alaska or from third party financing sources. However, falling oil and natural gas prices have substantially reduced Alaska\u2019s revenue from production taxes resulting in Alaska paying only statutorily established minimum amount of appropriations for Tax Credit certificates in the last several fiscal years rather than the amount to pay all the prior year\u2019s Tax Credit certificates. In an effort to satisfy the accounts receivable, our customer originally assigned to us $89.0 million of Tax Credit certificates and applications. As of December 31, 2018, we have monetized approximately $17.6 million of Tax Credit certificates and have an estimated $62.3 million of Tax Credit certificates and applications remaining for future monetization, net of actual and estimated audit adjustments related to issued and anticipated Tax Credit certificates.\nIn February 2018, we were advised by Alaska that, so long as only the statutorily established minimum amount is paid each year, we will not receive any payments until fiscal year 2021 and should not expect to be paid in full until fiscal year 2024. In June 2018, Alaska passed legislation allowing Alaska to issue bonds to pay its estimated $1.0 billion liability for Tax Credit certificates. If issued, Alaska will use the proceeds from the bonds to purchase Tax Credit certificates. Seismic companies will have two options from which to pick on a program-by-program basis. One option allows for the purchase of the Tax Credit certificates at a 10% discount rate from the time Alaska would otherwise pay under the statutory minimum. The second option allows for the purchase of the Tax Credit certificates at Alaska\u2019s cost of capital (estimated to be approximately 5.1%) but only if the seismic data is made publicly available.\nIn June 2018, based on assumptions made regarding the constitutionality of the bond issuance, the length of time until the bonds could be issued, the data that we want to remain confidential, and the likelihood of a discount on our pending Tax Credit application, we recorded a $19.0 million provision for doubtful accounts related to this receivable as the proceeds we expect to receive from the bond issuance and any other potential future monetizations will not be sufficient to fully repay our outstanding receivable.\nWhile we continue to pursue other options to monetize the Tax Credits, at this time we believe that the most likely path to monetize the Tax Credit certificates may be from proceeds that Alaska realizes from issuing its own bonds. This path has, however, complexities and risks. A lawsuit was filed asserting constitutional challenges to Alaska\u2019s ability to issue the bonds; however, the Attorney General issued an opinion that the issuance of the bonds is not prohibited by the Alaskan constitution and an Alaskan Superior Court judge threw out the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the issuance of the bonds. An appeal of the Superior Court\u2019s ruling to the Alaska Supreme Court has been made. The Revenue Department of the State of Alaska has indicated, however, that until the courts have resolved the legal issues, which we estimate may take up to an additional 18 months, it will not go into the bond markets.\nAs a result of the above, we face several risks regarding the collection of the accounts receivable and the related monetization of the Tax Credits. We may need to record additional provisions for doubtful accounts should we realize potentially higher effective discounts on the Tax Credits compared with what we have expected. While we believe that we will get paid some amount of the Tax Credits, we cannot assure you when that will occur or how much. The longer it takes to monetize the Tax Credits, the more it will have a negative impact on our liquidity and cash flows.\nIf we do not manage growth and contractions in our business effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nHistorically, we have experienced significant growth but for the last several years we have contracted our business in response to the decline in oil and natural gas exploration activities. Both growth and contraction have placed significant demands on our personnel, management, infrastructure and support mechanisms and other resources. We must continue to improve our operational, financial, management, legal compliance and information systems to keep pace with the growth of or contractions in our business. We may also expand through the strategic acquisition of companies and assets. We must plan and manage any acquisitions effectively to achieve revenue growth and maintain profitability in our evolving market. If we fail to manage growth of or contractions in our business effectively, our ability to provide services could be adversely affected, which could negatively affect our operating results.\nWe face intense competition in our business that could result in downward pricing pressure and the loss of market share.\nCompetition among seismic contractors historically has been, and likely will continue to be, intense. Competitive factors have in recent years included price, crew experience, asset availability and capacity, technological expertise and reputation for quality and dependability. We also face increasing competition from nationally owned companies in various international jurisdictions that operate under less significant financial constraints than those we experience. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources, more customers, greater market recognition and more established relationships and alliances in the industry than we do. They and other competitors may be better positioned to withstand and adjust more quickly to volatile market conditions, such as fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and production levels, as well as changes in government regulations. Additionally, the seismic data acquisition business is extremely price competitive and has a history of protracted periods of months or years where seismic contractors under financial duress bid jobs at unattractive pricing levels and therefore adversely affect industry pricing. Competition from those and other competitors could result in downward pricing pressure, which could adversely affect our margins, and could result in the loss of market share.\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from contracts awarded through a competitive bidding process which can involve significant costs and risks. This effort may not result in awards of business, which could have adverse consequences on our future profitability.\nMany or our customers award business through a competitive bidding process, which results in greater competition and increased pricing pressure. This competitive bidding process involves substantial costs and presents a number of risks, including the:\n\u2022\nsubstantial cost and managerial time and effort that we spend to prepare bids and proposals;\n\u2022\nneed to accurately estimate the resources and costs that will be required to service any contracts we are awarded; and\n\u2022\nopportunity cost of not bidding on and winning other contracts we may have otherwise pursued.\nEven if we are awarded contracts, we may fail to accurately estimate the resources and costs required to fulfill a contract, or to resolve problems with our subcontractors or suppliers, which could negatively impact the profitability of any contract award to us, particularly in the case of term contracts. In addition, following the award of a contract, we have experienced and may continue to experience significant expense or delay, contract modification or contract rescission as a result of customer actions that are beyond our control.\nWe have a history of losses and may not achieve consistent profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred substantial losses in prior years. In 2018 and 2017, we generated net losses of $82.7 million and $38.8 million, respectively. Our ability to be profitable in the future will depend on many factors beyond our control, but primarily on the level of demand for seismic data acquisition services by E&P companies. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to maintain or increase our level of profitability.\nOur agreements with our customers may not adequately protect us from unforeseen events or address all issues that could arise with our customers. The occurrence of unforeseen events or disputes with customers could result in increased liability, costs and expenses for our projects.\nWe enter into master service agreements with many of our customers that allocate certain operational risks. Despite the inclusion of risk allocation provisions in our agreements, our operations may be affected by a number of events that are unforeseen or not within our control and our agreements may not adequately protect us from each possible event. If an event occurs which we have not contemplated or otherwise addressed in our agreement we, and not our customer, will likely bear the increased cost or liability.\nTo the extent our agreements do not adequately address those and other issues, or we are not able to successfully resolve resulting disputes, we may incur increased liability, costs and expenses. This may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe operate under hazardous conditions that subject us and our employees to risk of damage to property or personal injury and limitations on our insurance coverage may expose us to potentially significant liability costs.\nOur activities are often conducted in dangerous environments and include hazardous conditions, including operation of heavy equipment, the detonation of explosives, and operations in remote areas of developing countries. Operating in such environments, and under such conditions, carries with it inherent risks, such as loss of human life or equipment, as well as the risk of downtime or reduced productivity resulting from equipment failures caused by an adverse operating environment. Those risks could cause us to experience injuries to our personnel, equipment losses, and interruptions in our business.\nAlthough we maintain insurance, our insurance contains certain coverage exclusions and policy limits. There can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or adequate to cover all losses or liabilities or that insurance will continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we may experience difficulties in collecting from insurers as such insurers may deny all or a portion of our claims for insurance coverage. A claim for which we are not fully insured, or which is excluded from coverage or exceeds the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to weather and seasonality, which may affect our ability to timely complete projects.\nOur seismic data acquisition services are performed outdoors, often in difficult or harsh climate conditions, and are therefore subject to weather and seasonality. In Canada and Alaska, the primary season for seismic data acquisition is during the winter, as many areas are only accessible when the ground is frozen. The weather conditions during this time of year can affect the timing and efficiency of operations. In addition, this prime season can be shortened by warmer weather conditions. In South America and Southeast Asia, our operations are affected by the periods of heavy rain in the areas where seismic operations are conducted.\nIn all areas in which we operate, the weather is an uncontrollable factor that affects our operations at various times of the year. Due to the unpredictability of weather conditions, there may be times when adverse conditions may cause our operations to be delayed and result in additional costs and may negatively affect our results of operations. In addition, even if we negotiate weather protection provisions in our contracts, we may not be fully compensated by our clients for delays caused by inclement weather.\nOur operations are subject to delays related to obtaining government permits and land access rights from third parties which could result in delays affecting our results of operations.\nOur seismic data acquisition operations could be adversely affected by our inability to obtain timely right of way usage from both public and private land and/or mineral owners. We cannot begin surveys on property without obtaining any required permits from governmental entities as well as the permission of the private landowners who own the land being surveyed. In recent years, it has become more difficult, costly and time-consuming to obtain access rights of way as drilling activities have expanded into more populated areas. Additionally, while landowners generally are cooperative in granting access rights, some have become more resistant to seismic and drilling activities occurring on their property. In addition, governmental entities do not always grant permits within the time periods expected. Delays associated with obtaining such permits and rights of way may negatively affect our results of operations, as has occurred with the recent federal government shutdown that delayed permitting on a proposed seismic shoot in Alaska.\nOur backlog can vary significantly from time to time. Our backlog estimates are based on certain assumptions and are subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and thus may not be timely converted to revenues in any particular fiscal period, if at all, or be indicative of our actual operating results for any future period.\nOur backlog estimates represent those projects for which a customer has executed a contract or signed a binding letter of award. Our backlog can vary significantly from time to time, particularly if the backlog is made up of multi-year contracts with some of our more significant customers. Backlog estimates are based on a number of assumptions and estimates including assumptions related to foreign exchange rates and proportionate performance of contracts. The realization of our backlog estimates is further affected by our performance under term rate contracts, as the early or late completion of a project under term rate contracts will generally result in decreased or increased, as the case may be, revenues derived from those projects. Contracts for services are also occasionally modified by mutual consent and often can be terminated for convenience by the customer. Because of potential changes in the scope or schedule of our customers\u2019 projects, and the possibility of early termination of customer contracts, we cannot predict with certainty when or if our backlog will be realized. Material delays, payment defaults or cancellations on the underlying contracts could reduce the amount of backlog currently reported and, consequently, could inhibit the conversion of that backlog into revenues. In addition, worsening overall market conditions could result in further reductions of backlog, which will impact our financial performance.\nCapital requirements for the technology we use can be significant. If we are unable to finance these requirements, we may not be able to maintain our competitive advantage.\nSeismic data acquisition technologies historically have steadily improved and progressed, and we expect this trend to continue. Manufacturers of seismic equipment may develop new systems that have competitive advantages relative to systems now in use that either render the equipment we currently use obsolete or require us to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain our competitive position. In order to remain competitive, we may need to continue to invest additional capital to maintain, upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition capabilities.\nOur capital requirements, which are primarily the cost of equipment, historically have been significant. We attempt to minimize our capital expenditures by restricting our purchase of equipment to equipment that we believe will remain highly utilized, and we strategically rent equipment utilizing the most current technology to cover peak periods in equipment demands. We may not be able to finance all our capital requirements, however, when and if needed, to acquire new equipment. If we are unable to do so, there may be a material negative impact on our operations and financial condition. Under our current business model, however, capital expenditures will be kept at minimum levels, other than for maintenance expenditures, until we see improvement in the market for seismic services. While we own or can rent the equipment needed for our current levels of business, long-term limiting our capital expenditures may result in an increased competitive disadvantage.\nA limited number of clients operating in a single industry account for a significant portion of our revenues, and the loss of one of these clients could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe derive our revenues from a relatively small number of E&P companies. Our largest customers can and typically do change from year to year and our largest customers in any one year may not be indicative of our largest customers in the future. If any of our customers were to terminate their contract with us on a large project or fail to contract for our services in the future because they are acquired, alter their exploration or development strategy, experience financial difficulties, as a result of concerns over our current cash flow and liquidity difficulties or for any other reason, and we were not able to replace their business with business from other customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be held liable for the actions of our subcontractors.\nWe often work as the general contractor on seismic data acquisition surveys and consequently engage a number of subcontractors to perform services and provide products. While we generally obtain contractual indemnification and insurance covering the acts of those subcontractors and require the subcontractors to obtain insurance for our benefit, there can be no assurance we will not be held liable for the actions of those subcontractors. In addition, subcontractors may cause damage or injury to our personnel and property that is not fully covered by insurance or by claims against the subcontractors.\nWe, along with our customers, are subject to compliance with governmental laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and may adversely affect the demand for our services.\nOur operations, and those of our customers, are subject to a variety of federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment, particularly those relating to emissions to air, discharges of water, treatment, storage and disposal of regulated materials and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. Those laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our operations including the acquisition of permits before commencing regulated activities and the limitation or prohibition of seismic activities in environmentally sensitive or protected areas such as wetlands or wilderness areas.\nNumerous governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) and analogous state agencies in the U.S. and governmental bodies with control over environmental matters in foreign jurisdictions, have the power to enforce compliance with those laws and regulations and any permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions. We may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions, remediation costs and natural resource damage claims, or experience interruptions in our operations for violations or liabilities arising under these laws and regulations. Further, we may become liable for damages against which we cannot adequately insure or against which we may elect not to insure because of high costs or other reasons. Our customers are subject to similar environmental laws and regulations.\nWe expend financial and managerial resources to comply with all the laws and regulations applicable to our operations. Any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly regulations, or that change waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. The fact that such laws or regulations change frequently makes it impossible for us to predict the cost or impact of such laws and regulations on our future operations. The costs of complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations are likely to increase over time and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance with respect to existing or new laws and regulations or that such compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, or on the operations of our customers which could affect demand for our services. Although regulatory developments that may occur in subsequent years could have the effect of reducing industry activity, we cannot predict the nature of any new restrictions or regulations that may be imposed. We may be required to increase operating expenses or capital expenditures in order to comply with any new restrictions or regulations.\nIn addition, as a result of the mobility of our equipment, operations in foreign jurisdictions and the utilization of a multi-national work force, we and our customers are subject to various federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions relating to the import or export of equipment and the immigration and employment of non-citizen employees or sub-contractors. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and analogous governmental bodies in foreign jurisdictions have laws and regulations which prohibit or restrict operations in certain jurisdictions and doing business with certain persons in such jurisdictions, and we and our customers may be required to obtain and maintain licenses, permits, visas and similar documentation for operations. We may incur substantial costs, including fines and damages, criminal or civil sanctions for violations or liabilities arising under these laws and regulations.\nCurrent and future legislation or regulation relating to climate change and hydraulic fracturing could negatively affect the exploration and production of oil and natural gas and adversely affect demand for our services.\nIn response to concerns suggesting that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d (\u201cGHG\u201d) (including carbon dioxide and methane), may be contributing to global climate change, legislative and regulatory measures to address the concerns are in various phases of discussion or implementation at the federal, state and international levels. Many states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have already taken legal measures intended to reduce GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or GHG cap and trade programs.\nThis increasing focus on global warming may result in new environmental laws or regulations that may negatively affect us, our suppliers and our customers. This could cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our suppliers, customers or both incurring additional compliance costs that get passed on to us. Moreover, passage of climate change legislation or other legislative or\nregulatory initiatives that regulate or restrict emissions of GHG may curtail production and demand for fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas in areas where our customers operate and thus adversely affect future demand for our services. Reductions in our revenues or increases in our expenses as a result of climate control initiatives could have adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of oil and natural gas wells. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate oil and natural gas production. Due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting, reporting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations.\nThese legislative and regulatory initiatives imposing additional reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult or costly to complete oil and natural gas wells. Shale natural gas and shale oil cannot be economically produced without extensive fracturing. In the event such initiatives are successful, demand for our seismic acquisition services may be adversely affected.\nWe face various risks associated with increased activism against oil and natural gas exploration and development activities.\nOpposition toward oil and natural gas drilling and development activity has been growing globally and is particularly pronounced in the United States. Companies in the oil and natural gas industry are often the target of activist efforts from both individuals and non-governmental organizations regarding safety, human rights, environmental matters, sustainability, and business practices. Anti-development activists are working to, among other things, reduce access to federal and state government lands and delay or cancel certain operations such as offshore drilling and development. For example, environmental activists have recently challenged lease sales, seismic acquisition activities and decisions to grant air quality permits in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for offshore drilling and have challenged permitting and lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska.\nFuture activist efforts could result in the following:\n\u2022\nreductions in governmental leasing permitting exploration and production activities;\n\u2022\ndelay or denial of government permits or land access rights;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the use of certain operating practices;\n\u2022\nlegal challenges or lawsuits;\n\u2022\ndamaging publicity about us;\n\u2022\nincreased regulations;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of doing business;\n\u2022\nreduction in demand for our services; and\n\u2022\nother adverse effects on our ability to provide our services.\nOur need to incur costs associated with responding to these initiatives or complying with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements resulting from these activities that are substantial and not adequately provided for, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations outside of the U.S. are subject to additional political, economic, and other risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, and our exposure to such risks will increase as we expand our international operations.\nOur operations outside of North America accounted for a substantial portion of our consolidated revenue. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in any business operating in foreign countries, and especially those operating in emerging markets. As we continue to increase our presence in those countries, our operations will continue to encounter the following risks, among others:\n\u2022\ngovernment instability or armed conflict, which can cause our potential customers to withdraw or delay investment in capital projects, thereby reducing or eliminating the viability of some markets for our services;\n\u2022\npotential expropriation, seizure, nationalization or detention of assets;\n\u2022\nrisks relating to foreign currency, as described below;\n\u2022\nimport/export quotas or unexpected changes in regulatory environments and trade barriers;\n\u2022\ncivil uprisings, riots and war, which can make it unsafe to continue operations, adversely affect both budgets and schedules and expose us to losses;\n\u2022\navailability of suitable personnel and equipment, which can be affected by government policy, or changes in policy, which limit the importation of qualified crew members or specialized equipment in areas where local resources are insufficient, and legal restrictions or other limitations on our ability to dismiss employees;\n\u2022\nlaws, regulations, decrees and court decisions under legal systems that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively applied and cause us to incur unanticipated and/or unrecoverable costs, as well as delays which may result in real or opportunity costs; and\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks, including kidnappings of our personnel.\nIf any of those or other similar events should occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation in many foreign jurisdictions and the final determination of our tax liabilities involves the interpretation of the statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide. Our tax returns are subject to routine examination by taxing authorities, and those examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes, penalties and/or interest.\nOur overall success as a global business depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing economic, social and political conditions. We may not succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business, and we may experience project disruptions and losses, which could negatively affect our profitability.\nEconomic and political conditions in Latin America pose numerous risks to our operations.\nOur business operations in the Latin American region constitute a material portion of our business. As events in the region have demonstrated, negative economic or political developments in one country in the region can lead to or exacerbate economic or political instability elsewhere in the region. Furthermore, events in recent years in other developing markets have placed pressures on the stability of the currencies of a number of countries in Latin America in which we operate, including Brazil, Colombia and Peru. While certain areas in the Latin American region have experienced economic growth, this recovery remains fragile.\nCertain Latin American economies have experienced shortages in foreign currency reserves and have adopted restrictions on the use of certain mechanisms to expatriate local earnings and convert local currencies into U.S. Dollars. Any such shortages or restrictions may limit or impede our ability to transfer or to convert such currencies into U.S. Dollars and to expatriate such funds for the purpose of making timely payments of interest and principal on our indebtedness. In addition, currency devaluations in one country may have adverse effects in another country.\nSome Latin American countries have historically experienced high rates of inflation. Inflation and some measures implemented to curb inflation have had significant negative effects on the economies of these countries. Governmental actions taken in an effort to curb inflation, coupled with speculation about possible future actions, have contributed to economic uncertainty at times in most Latin American countries. These countries may experience high levels of inflation in the future that could lead to further government intervention in the economy, including the introduction of government policies that could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if any of these countries experience high rates of inflation, we may not be able to adjust the price of our services sufficiently to offset the effects of inflation on our cost structures. A high inflation environment would also have negative effects on the level of economic activity and employment and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results of operations can be significantly affected by foreign currency fluctuations and regulations.\nA portion of our revenues is derived in the local currencies of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Accordingly, we are subject to risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In the future, and especially as we further expand our operations in international markets, our customers may increasingly make payments in non-U.S. currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our revenues, operating costs and operating margins. In addition, currency devaluation can result in a loss to us if we hold deposits of that currency. Hedging foreign currencies can be difficult, especially if the currency is not actively traded. We cannot predict the effect of future exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results.\nIn addition, we are subject to risks relating to governmental regulation of foreign currency, which may limit our ability to:\n\u2022\ntransfer funds from or convert currencies in certain countries;\n\u2022\nrepatriate foreign currency received in excess of local currency requirements; and\n\u2022\nrepatriate funds held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States at favorable tax rates.\nAs we continue to develop our operations in foreign countries, there is an increased risk that foreign currency controls may create difficulty in repatriating profits from foreign countries in the form of taxes or other restrictions, which could restrict our cash flow.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), and any determination that we violated the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and reputation.\nAs a U.S. corporation, we are subject to the regulations imposed by the FCPA and other laws that prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.\nWe operate in certain parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Thus, we face the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or consultants, given that these parties may not always be subject to our control. We could be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners even though our partners are not subject to the FCPA. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nA cyber incident could result in loss or corruption of customer data or information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss that affects us.\nWe have become increasingly dependent on our information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud application and services, to process and record our customers\u2019 seismic data, process our financial and operating data, communicate with our employees and for many other activities related to our business.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber-attacks, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. A cyber-attack could include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption, or result in denial of service on websites.\nOur technologies, systems and networks may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of customer proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. A cyber incident involving our information systems and related infrastructure could disrupt our business plans and negatively impact our operations, particularly if the incident affects our customers\u2019 data. Although to date we have not experienced any cyber-attacks, there can be no assurance that we will not be the target of cyber-attacks in the future or suffer such losses related to any cyber incident. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nThe enactment of legislation implementing changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws affecting the taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nChanges to U.S. or foreign tax laws could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. Due to the scope of our international business operations, any changes in the U.S. or foreign taxation of these operations may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. The international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure may expose us to potentially adverse tax consequences. We are subject to taxation in and to the tax laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. We are also subject to intercompany pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds between our companies. Adverse developments in these laws or regulations, or any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of these laws or regulations in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction, including the United States, may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, including the tax treatment or characterization of our indebtedness, intercompany loans and guarantees. If any applicable tax authorities, including the U.S. tax authorities, were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could result in the disallowance of deductions and the imposition of tax withholding.\nOur continued success depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior executives and other key personnel, and our business may be severely disrupted if we lose their services.\nOur continued success depends upon the continued services of our senior executives and other key personnel. Our senior executive and other key personnel possess many years of industry experience, are highly skilled and also have relationships with oil and natural gas companies and others in the industry that are integral to our ability to market and sell our services. If one or more of our senior executives or key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, it could disrupt our business operations, and we may not be able to replace them easily or at all. In addition, competition for senior executives and key personnel in our industry is intense, and we may be unable to retain our senior executives and key personnel or attract and retain new senior executives and key personnel in the future, in which case our business may be severely disrupted.\nThe requirements of being a public company increase our operating expenses and divert management\u2019s attention.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations require us to incur significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses that we would not incur if we were not a public company.\nThe Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the national securities exchanges, establish certain requirements for the corporate governance practices of public companies. For example, as a result of becoming a public company, we have additional board committees and are required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight are required. As a result, management\u2019s attention has been and will continue to be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results.\nBecause we are a smaller reporting company, to date our independent auditor has not been required to issue an attestation report regarding our internal control over financial reporting in the annual reports on Form 10-K that we file with the SEC, and we have been subject to scaled disclosure requirements. We will remain a smaller reporting company as long as of the end of our second fiscal quarter each year (i) the market value of our securities held by non-affiliates (\u201cpublic float\u201d) is below $250.0 million or (ii) we have annual revenues of less than $100.0 million and our public float is less than $700.0 million. If we cease to be a smaller reporting company, our expenses will further increase and additional time will be required of our management to comply with those additional requirements.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have $108.3 million in aggregate principal amount of long-term debt outstanding. Our high level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations and increase the risk that we may default on our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our existing indebtedness, which reduces the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to access the capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other expenses or to refinance existing indebtedness;\n\u2022\nplace restrictions on our ability to obtain additional financing, make investments, lease equipment, sell assets or engage in business combinations;\n\u2022\nheighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or in the general economy and restrict us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors with lower levels of indebtedness in relation to their overall size or less restrictive terms governing their indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business; and\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate or the general economy.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by a broad range of factors, including our ability to monetize our Tax Credits, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affecting us and our industry, many of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our existing and any future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying business activities or capital expenditures, selling assets or issuing equity, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may not be able to affect any of these actions on satisfactory terms or at all.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional debt in the future, subject to certain limitations, including debt under our credit facility. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could increase. Our level of indebtedness could, for instance, prevent us from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us or from making desirable capital expenditures. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow to devote to their operations. In addition, the incurrence of additional indebtedness could make it more difficult to satisfy our existing financial obligations.\nOur debt agreements impose or may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries that may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and restrict our ability to operate our business.\nOur debt agreements contain covenants that restrict our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to take various actions, such as:\n\u2022\nselling certain assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\ndeclaring or paying dividends on our common stock;\n\u2022\nmaking certain investments;\n\u2022\nincurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nprepaying subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreating or incurring liens;\n\u2022\nagreeing to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nconsolidating, merging, selling or otherwise disposing of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nentering into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nengaging in a business other than our current business and businesses related, ancillary or complementary, to our current businesses or immaterial businesses; and\n\u2022\ndesignating certain of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nIn addition, our debt agreements restrict us and our restricted subsidiaries from taking or omitting to take certain actions that would adversely affect or impair in any material respect the collateral securing our indebtedness.\nWe may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements. The requirement that we comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business.\nIf we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements, there could be an event of default under the terms of such agreements, which could result in an acceleration of repayment.\nIf we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements, there could be an event of default under the terms of those agreements. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. As a result, we cannot assure that we will be able to comply with these restrictions and covenants. In the event of a default under our debt agreements, lenders could terminate their commitments to lend or accelerate the loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. Borrowings under other debt that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions may also be accelerated and become due and payable.\nIf any of those events occur, our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to find alternative financing. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Additionally, we may not be able to amend our debt agreements or obtain needed waivers on satisfactory terms or without incurring substantial costs. Failure to maintain existing or secure new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nPrices for our common stock may be volatile, and investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nPrices of our common stock, like that of the securities of other energy companies, have been and may continue to be highly volatile. Factors such as announcements concerning changes in prices of oil and natural gas, exploration and development activities, the availability of capital, our cash flow and liquidity situation, our reverse stock splits and economic and other external factors, as well as quarterly or annual fluctuations in our financial results, may have a significant effect on the price of our common stock.\nThere are limited trading markets for our securities.\nFrom time to time, there has been limited trading volume in our common stock. There can be no assurance that there will continue to be an active trading market for our common stock or that any securities research analysts will provide research coverage on our common stock. It is possible that such factors will adversely affect the market for our common stock.\nIn addition, there is currently no market for, and we do not intend to list, our outstanding warrants on any securities exchange or any automated dealer quotation system. Accordingly, there may not be development of, or liquidity in, any market for the warrants. If a market were to develop, the warrants could trade at prices that may be higher or lower than their initial price depending upon many factors, including the price of our common stock, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and markets for similar securities.\nOwnership of our common stock is concentrated among our largest stockholders and their affiliates.\nA small number of stockholders hold a majority of our common stock, warrants and 2023 Notes. These stockholders have influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may limit your ability to influence corporate matters, and as a result, actions may be taken that you may not view as beneficial. Furthermore, these stockholders may sell their shares of common stock at any time. Such sales could be substantial and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our stock appreciates.\nWe do not plan to declare dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, restrictive covenants in certain debt agreements to which we are, or may be, a party, may limit our ability to pay dividends or for us to receive dividends from our operating companies, any of which may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their shares of common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their investment.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could deter or prevent a change in control.\nSome provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware statutes, may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control. These provisions, including those providing for the possible issuance of shares of our preferred stock and the right of the board of directors to amend the bylaws, may make it more difficult for other persons, without the approval of our board of directors, to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire a substantial number of shares of our common stock or to launch other takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in his or her best interest. These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nSignificant exercises of warrants or conversion of our 2023 Notes could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had 3.2 million shares of common stock issued and 3.1 million shares of common stock outstanding; however, the total number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding does not include 4.4 million shares that may be issued upon the exercise of warrants or 10.4 million shares issuable upon the conversion of our 2023 Notes. The exercise of warrants and the conversion of our 2023 Notes could adversely affect the price of our common stock, will reduce the percentage of common stock held by our current stockholders and may cause our current stockholders to suffer significant dilution, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13330, "SIC": 1382, "TIC": "SAEXQ"}
