RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to risks including, but not limited to, strategic, market, liquidity, credit, regulatory, technology, operational, security, and other business risks such as reputation damage related to negative publicity and dependencies on key personnel, customers, vendors, and systems. This section discusses material risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and condition and the value of, and return on, an investment in us. Although this section attempts to highlight key risk factors, other risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict all risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect us. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information included in this report.\nLoan Portfolio\nOur loan portfolio is subject to certain risks related to interest rates, and the derivatives we use to manage interest rate risks, prepayment risk, and credit risk, each of which could reduce the expected cash flows and earnings on our portfolio.\nInterest rate risk - basis and repricing risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk because the interest rate characteristics of our loan assets do not always match the interest rate characteristics of the funding for those assets.\nWe fund the majority of our FFELP student loan assets with one-month or three-month LIBOR indexed floating rate securities. Meanwhile, the interest earned on our FFELP student loan assets is indexed to one-month LIBOR, three-month commercial paper, and Treasury bill rates. The differing interest rate characteristics of our loan assets versus the liabilities funding these assets result in basis risk, which impacts the excess spread earned on our loans. We also face repricing risk due to the timing of the interest rate resets on our liabilities, which may occur as infrequently as once a quarter, in contrast to the timing of the\ninterest rate resets on our assets, which generally occur daily. In a declining interest rate environment, this may cause our variable student loan spread to compress, while in a rising interest rate environment, it may cause the variable spread to increase.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our AGM operating segment had $15.9 billion, $0.6 billion, and $0.5 billion of FFELP loans indexed to the one-month LIBOR, three-month commercial paper, and three-month Treasury bill rate, respectively, all of which reset daily, and $5.4 billion of debt indexed to three-month LIBOR, which resets quarterly, and $10.5 billion of debt indexed to one-month LIBOR, which resets monthly. While these indices are all short term in nature with rate movements that are highly correlated over a longer period of time, the indices' historically high level of correlation may be disrupted in the future due to capital market dislocations or other factors not within our control. In such circumstances, our earnings could be adversely affected to a material extent.\nWe have entered into basis swaps to hedge our basis and repricing risk, under which we receive three-month LIBOR set discretely in advance and pay one-month LIBOR plus or minus a spread as defined in the agreements (the \"1:3 Basis Swaps\").\nInterest rate risk - loss of floor income\nFFELP loans originated prior to April 1, 2006 generally earn interest at the higher of the borrower rate, which is fixed over a period of time, or a floating rate based on the Special Allowance Payments (\"SAP\") formula set by the Department. The SAP rate is based on an applicable index plus a fixed spread that depends on loan type, origination date, and repayment status. We generally finance our student loan portfolio with variable rate debt. In low and/or certain declining interest rate environments, when the fixed borrower rate is higher than the SAP rate, these student loans earn at a fixed rate while the interest on the variable rate debt typically continues to reflect the low and/or declining interest rates. In these interest rate environments, we may earn additional spread income that we refer to as floor income.\nDepending on the type of loan and when it originated, the borrower rate is either fixed to term or is reset to an annual rate each July 1. As a result, for loans where the borrower rate is fixed to term, we may earn floor income for an extended period of time, which we refer to as fixed rate floor income, and for those loans where the borrower rate is reset annually on July 1, we may earn floor income to the next reset date, which we refer to as variable rate floor income.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we earned $122.9 million of fixed rate floor income, which reflects $19.7 million of net settlements paid related to derivatives used to hedge loans earning fixed rate floor income. Absent the use of derivative instruments, a rise in interest rates will reduce the amount of floor income received and this will have an impact on earnings due to interest margin compression caused by increased financing costs, until such time as the federally insured loans earn interest at a variable rate in accordance with their SAP formulas. In higher interest rate environments, where the interest rate rises above the borrower rate and fixed rate loans effectively convert to variable rate loans, the impact of the rate fluctuations is reduced.\nInterest rate risk - use of derivatives\nWe utilize derivative instruments to manage interest rate sensitivity. See note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on derivatives used by us to manage interest rate risk. Our derivative instruments are intended as economic hedges but do not qualify for hedge accounting; consequently, the change in fair value, called the \u201cmark-to-market,\u201d of these derivative instruments is included in our operating results. Changes or shifts in the forward yield curve can and have significantly impacted the valuation of our derivatives, and in turn can and have impacted our results of operations.\nDeveloping an effective strategy for dealing with movements in interest rates is complex, and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with such fluctuations. Because many of our derivatives are not balance guaranteed to a particular pool of student loans and we may not elect to fully hedge our risk on a notional and/or duration basis, we are subject to the risk of being under or over hedged, which could result in material losses. In addition, our interest rate risk management activities could expose us to substantial mark-to-market losses if interest rates move in a materially different way than was expected based on the environment when the derivatives were entered into. As a result, our economic hedging activities may not effectively manage our interest rate sensitivity or have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nSince June 10, 2013, the CFTC has required over-the-counter derivative transactions to be executed through an exchange or central clearinghouse. Clearing is a process by which a third-party, the clearinghouse, steps in between the original counterparties and guarantees the performance of both, by requiring that each post substantial amounts of liquid collateral on an initial (initial margin) and mark-to-market (variation margin) basis to cover the clearinghouse's potential future exposure in the event of default. The clearing requirements require us to post substantial amounts of liquid collateral when executing new\nderivative instruments, which could negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources and may prevent or limit us from utilizing derivative instruments to manage interest rate sensitivity and risks.\nInterest rate movements have an impact on the amount of payments we are required to settle with our clearinghouse on a daily basis. We attempt to manage market risk associated with interest rates by establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken. However, if interest rates move materially and negatively impact the fair value of our derivative portfolio, the replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark rate as discussed below has significant adverse impacts on our derivatives, or if we enter into additional derivatives in which the fair value of such derivatives becomes negative, we could be required to pay a significant amount of variation margin to our clearinghouse. These payments, if significant, could negatively impact our liquidity and capital resources.\nBased on our interest rate swaps outstanding as of December 31, 2021, if the forward interest rate curve was 50 basis points lower for the remaining duration of these derivatives, we would have been required to pay approximately $64.6 million in additional variation margin. In addition, if the forward basis curve between one-month and three-month LIBOR experienced a ten-basis point reduction in spread for the remaining duration of our 1:3 Basis Swaps (in which we pay one-month LIBOR and receive three-month LIBOR), we would have been required to pay approximately $12.9 million in additional variation margin.\nIn addition, some of our variable rate debt is floored at zero percent, while the floating side of our fixed rate derivatives hedging the debt are not floored. If one-month LIBOR were to fall below zero percent, we may experience losses. The scope of these losses would depend on three factors - the notional amount of the fixed rate derivative portfolio, the extent to which one-month LIBOR is below zero percent, and the amount of time it remained there.\nInterest rate risk - replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark rate\nAs of December 31, 2021, the interest earned on a principal amount of $15.9 billion of our FFELP student loan assets held by the AGM operating segment was indexed to the one-month LIBOR, and the interest paid on a principal amount of $15.9 billion of our FFELP student loan asset-backed debt securities was indexed to one-month or three-month LIBOR. In addition, our derivative financial instrument transactions used to manage LIBOR interest rate risks are indexed to LIBOR.\nIn March 2021, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that all LIBOR tenors relevant to us will cease to be published or will no longer be representative after June 30, 2023. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a committee convened by the Federal Reserve that includes major market participants, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), calculated based on overnight repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities, as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. There are significant differences between LIBOR and SOFR, such as LIBOR being an unsecured lending rate while SOFR is a secured lending rate, and SOFR being an overnight rate while LIBOR reflects term rates at different maturities. Accordingly, there are uncertainties as to the transition process and broad acceptance of SOFR as the primary alternative to LIBOR, including what effect it would have on the value of LIBOR-based securities, financial contracts, and variable rate loans.\nAlthough the indentures for student loan asset-backed debt securities issued in our most recent LIBOR-indexed securitization transactions include new interest rate determination fallback provisions emerging in the market for new issuances of LIBOR-indexed debt securities, many of the contracts for our existing LIBOR-indexed assets, liabilities, and derivative instruments from historical transactions do not include provisions that contemplated the possibility of a permanent discontinuation of LIBOR and clearly specified a method for transitioning from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark rate, and it is not yet known how the market in general, specific counterparties in particular, the courts, or regulators will address the significant complexities and uncertainties involved in the transition away from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark rate. Specifically, the Department has not yet indicated any market transition away from the current LIBOR framework for paying special allowance payments to holders of FFELP assets. As a result, we cannot predict the impact that the transition from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark rate will have on our existing LIBOR-indexed assets, liabilities, and derivative instruments, but such impact could have material adverse effects on the value, performance, and related cash flows of such LIBOR-indexed items, including our funding costs, net interest income, loan and other asset values, and asset-liability management strategies. In particular, such transition could:\n\u2022adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, the income and expenses associated with, and the pricing and value of our LIBOR-based assets and liabilities, which include the majority of our FFELP student loan assets and FFELP student loan asset-backed debt securities issued to fund those assets, as well as the majority of our derivative financial instruments we use to manage LIBOR-based interest rate risks associated with such FFELP student loan-related assets and liabilities;\n\u2022result in uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amounts on our LIBOR-based assets and liabilities depending on the terms of the governing instruments, which in turn could result in disputes,\nlitigation, or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based securities and contracts, and the potential renegotiation of previous contracts;\n\u2022make future asset-backed securitizations more difficult to complete or more expensive until LIBOR or alternative benchmark rate uncertainties are resolved; and\n\u2022result in basis risk if the alternative benchmark rate on our loan assets does not match the alternative benchmark rate for the funding for those assets.\nIn April 2021, the State of New York enacted legislation to address certain contracts that are governed by New York law, refer to LIBOR as a benchmark reference rate, and do not have effective fallback provisions once the applicable LIBOR rate is discontinued. The legislation provides a statutory remedy by automatically replacing LIBOR with the \u201crecommended benchmark replacement,\u201d which is expected to be SOFR, and for a contract that has a \u201cdetermining person\u201d (a trustee, a calculation agent or the like), replacing LIBOR with the recommended benchmark replacement as selected by the determining person. The majority of our student loan asset-backed securitization indentures that do not have fallback provisions are governed by New York law, and thus are covered by this legislation. Parties remain free to agree on a different alternative benchmark rate, and we have and will continue to work with our asset-backed securitization investors to amend transaction documents to address the discontinuation of LIBOR.\nIn addition, a transition away from LIBOR to an alternative benchmark rate or rates may impact our existing transaction data, systems, operations, pricing, and risk management processes, and require significant efforts to transition to or develop appropriate systems and analytics to reflect a new benchmark rate environment. There can be no assurance that such efforts will successfully mitigate the financial and operational risks associated with a transition away from LIBOR.\nPrepayment risk\nHigher rates of prepayments of student loans, including consolidations by the Department through the Federal Direct Loan Program or private refinancing programs, would reduce our interest income.\nPursuant to the Higher Education Act, borrowers may prepay loans made under the FFEL Program at any time without penalty. Prepayments may result from consolidations of student loans by the Department through the Federal Direct Loan Program or by a lending institution through a private education or unsecured consumer loan, which historically tend to occur more frequently in low interest rate environments; from borrower defaults on federally insured loans, which will result in the receipt of a guaranty payment; and from voluntary full or partial prepayments; among other things.\nLegislative and executive action risk exists as Congress and the President evaluate economic stimulus packages and proposals to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. If the federal government and the Department initiate additional loan forgiveness or cancellation, other repayment options or plans, consolidation loan programs, or further extend the suspension of borrower payments under the CARES Act, such initiatives could further increase prepayments and reduce interest income and could also reduce servicing fees. Future laws, executive actions, or other policy statements may encourage or force consolidation, create additional income-based repayment or debt forgiveness programs, create broad debt cancellation programs, or establish other policies and programs that impact prepayments on education loans. Even if a broad debt cancellation program only applied to student loans held by the Department, such program could result in a significant increase in consolidations of FFELP loans to Federal Direct Loan Program loans and a corresponding increase in prepayments with respect to our FFELP loan portfolio. For example, the Department recently announced a set of policy changes and released proposed negotiated rulemaking materials relating to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program under its Federal Direct Loan Program, which may result in an increase in consolidations of FFELP loans into Federal Direct Loan Program loans held by the Department (which results in the loans no longer being on our balance sheet). While implementation of the policy changes and final new regulations are unknown at this time, individually or collectively, they may cause higher than anticipated prepayment rates on our portfolio of loans. Some variability in prepayment levels is expected, although extraordinary or extended increases in prepayment rates could have a materially adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows, profitability, and business outlook, and, as a result, could materially, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict how or what programs or policies will be impacted by any actions that the Administration, Congress, or the federal government may take.\nCredit risk\nFuture losses due to defaults on loans held by us present credit risk which could adversely affect our earnings. Our estimated allowance for loan losses is based on periodic evaluations of the credit risk in our loan portfolios, including the consideration of the following factors (as applicable), for each of our loan portfolios: loans in repayment versus those in nonpaying status;\ndelinquency status; type of private education or consumer loan program; trends in defaults in the portfolio based on internal and industry data; past experience; trends in federally insured student loan claims rejected for payment by guarantors; changes to federal student loan programs; current macroeconomic factors, including unemployment rates, gross domestic product, and consumer price index; and other relevant qualitative factors.\nThe vast majority (97.1 percent) of our student loan portfolio is federally guaranteed. The federal government currently guarantees 97 percent of the principal and interest on federally insured student loans disbursed on and after July 1, 2006 (and 98 percent for those loans disbursed on and after October 1, 1993 and prior to July 1, 2006), which limits our loss exposure on the outstanding balance of our federally insured portfolio. Federally insured student loans disbursed prior to October 1, 1993 are fully insured for both principal and interest. Our private education and consumer loans are unsecured, with neither a government nor a private insurance guarantee. Accordingly, we bear the full risk of loss on these loans if the borrower and co-borrower, if applicable, default. We are actively expanding our acquisition of private education and consumer loan portfolios, which increases our exposure to credit risk.\nIf future defaults on loans held by us are higher than anticipated, which could result from a variety of factors such as downturns in the economy, regulatory or operational changes, and other unforeseen future trends, or actual performance is significantly worse than currently estimated, our estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses in our statements of income would be materially affected.\nOur loan portfolio and other assets and operations could suffer adverse consequences to the extent that natural disasters, widespread health crises similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, terrorist activities, or international hostilities affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region.\nNatural disasters, widespread health crises similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, terrorist activities, or international hostilities affecting the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region could lead, for example, to an increase in loan delinquencies, borrower bankruptcies, or defaults that could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, and provisions for credit losses, as well as have adverse effects on our other assets and business operations. Our ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning, and our ability, if any, to anticipate the nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse impact of natural disasters, widespread health crises, terrorist activities, or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we transact with, particularly those that we depend upon, but have no control over.\nLiquidity and Funding\nThe current maturities of our loan warehouse financing facilities do not match the maturities of the related funded loans, and we may not be able to modify and/or find alternative funding related to the loan collateral in these facilities prior to their expiration.\nThe majority of our portfolio of student loans is funded through asset-backed securitizations that are structured to substantially match the maturities of the funded assets, and there are minimal liquidity issues related to these facilities. We also have loans funded in shorter term warehouse facilities. The current maturities of the warehouse facilities do not match the maturity of the related funded assets. Therefore, we will need to modify and/or find alternative funding related to the loan collateral in these facilities prior to their expiration.\nWe have a FFELP warehouse facility as described in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report. The FFELP warehouse facility has an aggregate maximum financing amount of $60 million and liquidity provisions through May 23, 2022. In the event we are unable to renew the liquidity provisions for this facility, the facility would become a term facility at a stepped-up cost, with no additional student loans being eligible for financing, and we would be required to refinance the existing loans in the facility by the final maturity date in May 2023. The FFELP warehouse facility also contains financial covenants relating to levels of our consolidated net worth, ratio of recourse indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA, and unencumbered cash. Any noncompliance with these covenants could result in a requirement for the immediate repayment of any outstanding borrowings under the facility. As of December 31, 2021, $5.0 million was outstanding under the FFELP warehouse facility and $0.3 million was advanced as equity support.\nWe also have a private education loan warehouse facility that has an aggregate maximum financing amount available of $175.0 million, liquidity provisions through June 30, 2022, and a final maturity date of June 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2021, $107.0 million was outstanding and $11.8 million was advanced as equity support under this warehouse facility.\nIf we are unable to obtain cost-effective funding alternatives for the loans in the warehouse facilities prior to the facilities' maturities, our cost of funds could increase, adversely affecting our results of operations. If we cannot find funding alternatives, we would lose our collateral, including the loan assets and cash advances, related to these facilities.\nWe are subject to economic and market fluctuations related to our investments.\nWe currently invest a substantial portion of our excess cash in student loan asset-backed securities and other investments that are subject to market fluctuations. The fair value of these investments was $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2021, including $907.2 million in student loan asset-backed securities. The student loan asset-backed securities earn a floating interest rate and carry expected returns of approximately LIBOR + 75-250 basis points to maturity. While we expect our overall student loan asset-backed securities to have few credit issues if held to maturity, they do have limited liquidity, and we could incur a significant loss if the investments were sold prior to maturity at an amount less than the original purchase price.\nWe will need to extend or refinance repurchase agreements funding the purchase of certain private education loan asset-backed securities that we are required to retain as sponsor of the underlying securitizations, since the current maturities of the agreements do not match the required holding period for the related investments and we are required to pay additional equity support in the event the fair value of the securities subject to the repurchase agreements becomes less than the original purchase price of such securities.\nDuring 2021, we sponsored four asset-backed securitization transactions to permanently finance a total of $8.7 billion of the private education loans sold by Wells Fargo. For further information about these transactions, see the MD&A - \u201cOverview - Recent Transactions/Developments - 2021 Transactions Related to the Private Education Loan Portfolio Sold by Wells Fargo.\u201d As sponsor, we are required to provide a certain level of risk retention, and we have purchased bonds issued in such securitizations to satisfy this requirement. The bonds purchased to satisfy the risk retention requirement are reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as \"investments\" and as of December 31, 2021, the fair value of these bonds was $412.6 million. We must retain these investment securities until the latest of (i) two years from the closing date of the securitization, (ii) the date the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the loans in the securitization is 33% or less of the initial loan balance, and (iii) the date the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the bonds is 33% or less of the aggregate initial outstanding principal balance of the bonds, at which time we can sell the investment securities (bonds) to a third party. We entered into repurchase agreements with third parties, the proceeds of which were used to purchase a portion of the asset-backed investments, and such investments serve as collateral on the repurchase obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, $483.8 million was outstanding on our repurchase agreements, of which $313.2 million was borrowed to fund the private education loan securitization bonds subject to our risk retention requirements. The repurchase agreements have various maturity dates between May 27, 2022 and December 20, 2023, but are subject to early termination upon required notice provided by us or the applicable counterparty prior to the maturity dates. We are required to pay additional equity support in the event the fair value of the securities subject to the repurchase agreements becomes less than the original purchase price of such securities.\nThe current maturities of the repurchase agreements do not match the required holding period for, or the maturity of, the related funded assets. Therefore, we will need to continue to extend the maturities of the repurchase agreements and/or find alternative funding related to the investment securities collateral funded by these repurchase agreements prior to their expiration.\nOperations\nRisks associated with our operations, as further discussed below, include those related to the importance of maintaining scale by retaining existing customers and attracting new business opportunities, our information technology systems and potential security and privacy breaches, and our ability to manage performance related to regulatory requirements.\nOur largest fee-based customer, the Department of Education, represented 29 percent of our revenue in 2021. Failure to extend the Department contracts or obtain new Department contracts in the Department's NextGen or other procurement processes, our inability to consistently surpass competitor performance metrics, or unfavorable contract modifications or interpretations, could significantly lower servicing revenue and hinder future service opportunities.\nOur subsidiaries Nelnet Servicing and Great Lakes are two of the current seven private sector entities that have student loan servicing contracts with the Department to service loans that include Federal Direct Loan Program loans originated directly by the Department and FFEL Program loans purchased by the Department. As of December 31, 2021, Nelnet Servicing was servicing $215.8 billion of student loans for 6.4 million borrowers under its contract, and Great Lakes was servicing $262.6 billion of student loans for 7.8 million borrowers under its contract. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized $360.8 million in revenue from the Department under these contracts, which represented 29 percent of our revenue.\nNelnet Servicing's and Great Lakes' student loan servicing contracts with the Department are scheduled to expire on December 14, 2023. In 2017, the Department initiated a contract procurement process referred to as the Next Generation Financial Services Environment (\"NextGen\") for a new framework for the servicing of all student loans owned by the Department. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 contains provisions directing certain aspects of the NextGen process, including that any\nnew federal student loan servicing environment is required to provide for the participation of multiple student loan servicers and the allocation of borrower accounts to eligible student loan servicers based on performance.\nIn the event that our servicing contracts are not extended beyond the current expiration date, or we are not chosen as a subsequent servicer, loan servicing revenue would decrease significantly. There are significant risks to us and uncertainties regarding the current Department contracts and potential future Department contracts, including the pending and uncertain nature of the NextGen contract procurement process and the Department's prior awards of new NextGen contracts to other service providers; risks that we may not be successful in obtaining any new contracts with the Department; and risks and uncertainties as to the terms and requirements under a potential new contract or contracts with the Department. We cannot predict the timing, nature, or ultimate outcome of the NextGen or any other contract procurement process by the Department.\nNew loan volume is currently allocated among the Department servicers based on certain performance metrics established by the Department and compared among all loan servicers. The amount of future allocations of new loan volume could be negatively impacted if we are unable to consistently surpass comparable competitor and/or other performance metrics.\nIn the event the current or any future Department servicing contracts become subject to unfavorable modifications or interpretations by the Department, loan servicing revenue could decrease significantly, performance penalties could be assessed, and/or operating costs to perform the contracts could increase significantly.\nAdditionally, we are partially dependent on the existing Department contracts to broaden servicing operations with the Department, other federal and state agencies, and commercial clients. The size and importance of these contracts provide us the scale and infrastructure needed to profitably expand into new business opportunities. Failure to extend the Department contracts beyond the current expiration date, or obtain new Department contracts, could significantly hinder future opportunities, as well as result in potential restructuring charges that may be necessary to re-align our cost structure with our servicing operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our results of operations, and either directly or indirectly through impacts on economic conditions or government policy could adversely impact our results of operations, businesses, financial condition, and/or cash flows going forward.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption to the U.S. and world economies and extreme volatility in the U.S. and world markets. These effects have adversely impacted our results of operations and, if these effects result in sustained economic stress, they could have a material adverse impact on us in a number of ways, including but not limited to, talent acquisition and retention, wage inflation and cost of service delivery, lower higher education school enrollments, rising interest rates due to market conditions or government policy or stimulus, loan performance (where individual student and consumer borrowers experience financial hardship), and performance levels and impacts of vaccine requirements on our workforce and work environment (work from home). Although certain business and economic conditions have improved since the pandemic began, significant uncertainties remain, including with respect to the effectiveness of vaccines against existing and new variant strains of the COVID-19 virus which could be vaccine resistant, the potential impacts of variations in vaccination rates among different geographical areas and demographic segments, vaccine mandates, booster vaccines, and the potential impacts of potential additional future spikes in infection rates including through breakthrough infections among the fully vaccinated.\nCOVID-19 materially disrupted business operations across many sectors, initially resulting in periods of significantly higher levels of unemployment and underemployment, and more recently resulting in inflation associated with supply chain disruptions, a constrained labor market, supply, and extensive government stimulus programs initiated in efforts to counteract the economic disruptions from the pandemic. As a result, many student and consumer borrowers have experienced or may continue to experience financial hardship, making it difficult to meet loan payment obligations without assistance, which has had previous adverse effects and could have future adverse effects on the performance of our loan portfolio.\nOur net interest income and profitability have been and could further be negatively affected by volatility in interest rates caused by uncertainties stemming from COVID-19. Higher income volatility from changes in interest rates and spreads to benchmark indices has caused and could cause a loss of net interest income and adverse changes in current fair value measurements of our assets and liabilities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our net income, operating results, or financial condition. For example, the Federal Reserve has recently signaled that it may begin to raise its target interest rate beginning in the first half of 2022 as a way of addressing the inflationary effects of the extensive pandemic-related government stimulus programs, and an increase in interest rate levels generally results in a reduction of floor income we receive on certain FFELP loans.\nA vast majority of our employees continue to work from home, either full-time or dividing their workdays between working from home and working in the office as we have offered employees flexibility in the amount of time they work in offices that were reopened in 2021. Unanticipated issues arising from handling personal, confidential, and other information in a work-\nfrom-home environment could lead to greater risks for us, including cybersecurity and privacy risks. In addition, recent labor market constraints have resulted in wage inflation and higher voluntary turnover rates, which in turn have led to increases in compensation costs to attract and retain talent. Further, in September 2021, the President issued an executive order that would require certain COVID-19 precautions for government contractors, including mandatory employee vaccinations. These requirements would apply to us as a student loan servicer for the Department, but are currently stayed pending the outcome of ongoing litigation. Any implementation of vaccination mandates applicable to our employees could result in workplace disruptions, employee attrition, and difficulty securing future talent needs in an increasingly competitive job market.\nThe CARES Act suspended federal student loan payments and interest accruals on all loans owned by the Department beginning as of March 13, 2020, and this suspension has been extended through May 1, 2022. As a result of this suspension, we receive a reduced level of servicing revenue per borrower from the Department. In addition, revenue from the Department for originating consolidation loans has been adversely impacted because of borrowers receiving relief on their existing loans, thus not initiating a consolidation. If the suspension period is extended further, more borrowers may consolidate their FFELP loans to the Federal Direct Loan Program, which could further increase prepayments on our loan portfolio and reduce our interest income and servicing fees. We currently anticipate the above revenues will continue to be negatively impacted while student loan payments and interest accruals are suspended.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact us will depend on many factors which are uncertain and beyond our control, including: the duration and ultimate severity of the pandemic; further public health and economic dislocations and constraints resulting from the pandemic; government actions in response to the pandemic, including any further actions to suspend, reduce or cancel payment obligations for loan borrowers; and the impacts of the pandemic on the U.S. and world economies. However, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other pandemic, on our businesses could be material and adverse. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect broader economic conditions and/or adversely affects us, it may also have the effect of increasing the likelihood and/or magnitude of other risks described in this report.\nClimate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could have a material adverse impact on our operations, vendors, and customers.\nOur businesses, and the activities of our vendors and customers, could be impacted by climate change. Climate change could manifest as a financial risk to us either through changes in the physical climate or from the process of transitioning to a low-carbon economy, including changes in climate policy or in the regulation of businesses with respect to risks posed by climate change. Climate-related physical risks may include altered distribution and intensity of rainfall, prolonged droughts or flooding, increased frequency and severity of wildfires, hurricanes, and tornadoes, rising sea levels, and a rising heat index. In addition to possible changes in climate policy and regulation, potential transition risks may include economic and other changes engendered by the development of low-carbon technological advances (e.g., electric vehicles and renewable energy) and/or changes in consumer and business preferences toward low-carbon goods and services. These climate-related physical risks and transition risks could have a financial impact on us, and our vendors and customers, including declines in asset values; cost increases; reduced availability of insurance; reduced demand for certain goods and services; increased loan delinquencies, bankruptcies, events of default, and force majeure events; increased interruptions to business operations and services; adverse supply chain impacts; and negative consequences to business models, and the need to make changes in response to those consequences.\nA failure of our operating systems or infrastructure could disrupt our businesses, cause significant losses, result in regulatory action, and damage our reputation.\nWe operate many different businesses in diverse markets and depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer network systems, software, datacenters, cloud services providers, telecommunications systems, and the rest of our operating systems and infrastructure to process and monitor large numbers of daily transactions in compliance with contractual, legal, regulatory, and our own standards. Such systems and infrastructure could be disrupted because of a cyberattack, spikes in transaction volume, power outages, telecommunications failures, process breakdowns, degradation or loss of internet or website availability, natural disasters, political or social unrest, and terrorist acts. A significant adverse incident could damage our reputation and credibility, lead to customer dissatisfaction and loss of customers or revenue, and result in regulatory action, in addition to increased costs to service our customers and protect our network. Such an event could also result in large expenditures to repair or replace the damaged properties, networks, or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and our business continuity plans may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Any significant loss of customers or revenue, or significant increase in costs of serving those customers, could adversely affect our growth, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOperating system and infrastructure risks continue to increase in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to support and process customer transactions, the increased number and complexity of transactions being processed, changes to the way we do business due to the COVID-19 pandemic (like increased instances of employees working from home and/or using personal computing devices), and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, nation state threat actors, and other external parties. In addition, to access our services and products, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablet computers, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control systems.\nMalicious and abusive activities, such as the dissemination of computer viruses, worms, and other destructive or disruptive software, internal and external threats, computer hacking, social engineering, denial of service attacks, ransomware or ransom demands to not expose confidential data or vulnerabilities in systems, and other malicious activities have become more common. These activities could have material adverse consequences on our network and our customers, including degradation of service, excessive call volume, and damage to our or our customers' equipment and data. Although to date we have not experienced a material loss relating to cyberattacks or system outage, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future or that there is not a current threat that remains undetected at this time. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, and the size and scale of our services.\nWe could also incur material losses resulting from the risk of unauthorized access to our computer systems, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and failures to properly execute business continuation and disaster recovery plans. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems, or unauthorized employee actions, we could suffer material financial loss, potential legal actions, fines, or civil monetary penalties that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity and damage to our reputation.\nAs a result of the above risks, we continue to develop and enhance our training, controls, processes, and practices designed to protect, monitor, and restore our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access, and this remains a priority for us, each of our business segments, and our Board of Directors. Even though we maintain technology and telecommunication, professional services, media, network security, privacy, injury, and liability insurance coverage to offset costs related to a cyberattack, information security breach, or extended system outage, this insurance coverage may not cover all costs of such incidents.\nA security breach of our information technology systems could result in material financial losses and legal exposure, and damage to our reputation.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of personal, confidential and other sensitive information in our information technology systems, including customer, personnel, and vendor data. Although we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our systems, software, and networks and to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to us and our customers, we experience increasingly numerous and more sophisticated attacks on our systems, and our cybersecurity measures may not be entirely effective.\nWe may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all types of security breaches, because the techniques used change frequently, generally increase in sophistication, often are not recognized until launched, sometimes go undetected even when successful, and result in cybersecurity attacks originating from a wide variety of sources, including organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, hostile foreign governments, and other external parties. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information to gain access to our data or that of our customers, such as through \u201cphishing\u201d schemes. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile and internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. In addition, our customers often use their own devices, such as computers, smart phones, and tablet computers, to make payments and manage their accounts. We have limited ability to assure the safety and security of our customers\u2019 transactions to the extent they are using their own devices, which could be subject to similar threats. A penetration or circumvention of our information security systems, or the intentional or unintentional disclosure, alteration or destruction by an authorized user of confidential information necessary for our operations, could result in serious negative consequences for us. These consequences may include violations of applicable privacy and other laws; financial loss to us or to our customers; loss of confidence in our cybersecurity measures; customer dissatisfaction; significant litigation exposure; regulatory fines, penalties or intervention; reimbursement or other compensatory costs; additional compliance costs; significant disruption of our business operations; and harm to our reputation.\nIn addition, we routinely transmit, receive, and process large volumes of personal, confidential, and proprietary information through third parties. Although we work to ensure that third parties with which we do business maintain information security systems and processes, those measures may not be entirely effective, and an information security breach of a third-party system may not be revealed to us in a timely manner, which could compromise our ability to respond effectively. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential, or proprietary information being processed, sent to or received from a third party could result in material adverse legal liability, regulatory actions, disruptions, and reputational harm with respect to our businesses.\nWe and our third-party vendors have experienced, and could experience in the future, cyber-attacks and information security breaches. Although to date none of these attacks or breaches has individually or in the aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer material adverse effects in the future or that there is not a significant current threat that remains undetected at this time.\nWe must adapt to rapid technological change. If we are unable to take advantage of technological developments or our software products experience quality problems and development delays, we may experience a decline in the demand for our products and services.\nOur long-term operating results depend substantially upon our ability to continually enhance, develop, introduce, and market new products and services. We must continually and cost-effectively maintain and improve our information technology systems and infrastructure in order to successfully deliver competitive and cost-effective products and services to our customers. The widespread adoption of new technologies and market demands could require substantial expenditures to enhance system infrastructure and existing products and services. If we fail to enhance and scale our systems and operational infrastructure or products and services, our operating segments may lose their competitive advantage and this could adversely affect financial and operating results.\nWe require skilled technology and security workers to maintain, secure, and improve our information technology systems and infrastructure. Talent availability, increased demand and competition for skilled workers across the technology sector may impact our ability to maintain adequate technology and security staffing levels. If we are unable to retain existing talent, or recruit and hire new talent when needed, we may be unable to quickly adopt new technologies, or maintain and improve our technology systems and infrastructure.\nOur products and services are based on sophisticated software and computing systems that often encounter development delays, and the underlying software may contain undetected bugs or other defects that interfere with its intended operation. Quality problems with our software products, with transferring between systems or with errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions, could result in additional development costs, diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts, loss of credibility with current or potential clients, harm to our reputation, or exposure to liability claims.\nWe rely on third parties for a wide array of services for our customers, and to meet our contractual obligations. The failure of a third party with which we work could adversely affect our business performance and reputation.\nWe rely on third parties for a wide array of critical operational services, technology, datacenter hosting facilities, cloud computing platforms, and software. We also rely upon data from external sources to maintain our proprietary databases, including data from customers, business partners, and various government sources.\nOur third-party service providers may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, cyberattacks, telecommunications failures, supply chain disruptions, acts of terrorism, and similar events. They may also be subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, and similar misconduct, as well as local administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements, and litigation to stop, limit, or delay operations. If a third-party service provider experiences an outage, or our services are disrupted, we may temporarily lose the ability to conduct certain business activities, which could impact our ability to serve our customers and meet our contractual, legal, or regulatory compliance obligations. Our businesses would also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our services are unreliable. Even though we have selected the third parties with which we do business carefully and have disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements, our services could be interrupted. Some of our third-party service providers may engage vendors of their own as they provide services or technology solutions for our operations, which introduces the same risks that these \u201cfourth parties\u201d could be the source of operational failures.\nThird parties that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearinghouses, payment networks, or financial intermediaries, could also be sources of operational risks to our businesses, including with respect to breakdowns or failures of their systems, misconduct by their employees, or cyberattacks that could affect their ability to deliver a product or service to us\nor result in the loss or compromise of our information or the information of our customers. Our ability to implement backup systems or other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is limited. Furthermore, an attack on, or failure of, a third-party system may not be revealed to us in a timely manner, which could compromise our ability to respond effectively.\nOur reliance on Amazon Web Services to deliver cloud computing services is significant, and any disruptions with our use of Amazon Web Services could adversely impact our business and operations.\nAmazon Web Services (\"AWS\") provides infrastructure and software services for a significant amount of our technology products and services. As we continue to modernize our systems, the level of dependence on AWS' cloud services will grow. We also rely on AWS for our system backups and archive storage, and a substantial amount of our users' information and confidential business information is stored in the AWS cloud environment. Given that we contract with many third-party service providers and utilize third-party software applications that are also dependent on AWS, the stability and availability of AWS is critical to our business.\nAWS' operations and facilities are susceptible to service interruptions and damage, and we have limited control over the AWS operations and facilities that support our business. We have implemented contingency plans for disaster recovery and business continuity but are limited in our ability to move quickly off AWS to another cloud service provider. Any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS could adversely impact our operations and our business. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could also harm our reputation and brand.\nWe must satisfy certain requirements necessary to maintain the federal guarantees of our federally insured loans and the federally insured loans that we service for third parties, and we may incur penalties or lose our guarantees if we fail to meet these requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we serviced $26.9 billion of FFELP loans that maintained a federal guarantee, of which $14.6 billion and $12.3 billion were owned by us and third-party entities, respectively. We must meet various requirements in order to maintain the federal guarantee on federally insured loans, which is conditional based on compliance with origination, servicing, and collection policies set by the Department and guaranty agencies. If we misinterpret Department guidance, or incorrectly apply the Higher Education Act, the Department could determine that we are not in compliance. Federally insured loans that are not originated, disbursed, or serviced in accordance with the Department's and guaranty agency regulations may risk partial or complete loss of the guarantee. If we experience a high rate of servicing deficiencies (including any deficiencies resulting from the conversion of loans from one servicing platform to another, errors in the loan origination process, establishment of the borrower's repayment status, and due diligence or claim filing processes), it could result in the loan guarantee being revoked or denied. In most cases we have the opportunity to cure these deficiencies by following a prescribed cure process which usually involves obtaining the borrower's reaffirmation of the debt. However, not all deficiencies can be cured.\nA guaranty agency may also assess an interest penalty upon claim payment if the deficiency does not result in a loan rejection. These interest penalties are not subject to cure provisions and are typically related to isolated instances of due diligence deficiencies. Additionally, we may become ineligible for special allowance payment benefits from the time of the first deficiency leading to the loan rejection through the date that the loan is cured.\nAs FFELP loan holders, servicers, and guaranty agencies exit the loan program and consolidation within the industry takes place, this increases the complexity of servicing and claim filing due to the amount of loan servicing and loan guaranty transfers and the opportunity for errors at the time a claim is filed.\nFailure to comply with federal and guarantor regulations may result in fines, penalties, the loss of the insurance and related federal guarantees on affected FFELP loans, the loss of special allowance payment benefits, expenses required to cure servicing deficiencies, suspension or termination of the right to participate as a FFELP servicer, negative publicity, and potential legal claims, including potential claims by our servicing customers if they lose the federal guarantee on loans that we service for them. If we are subjected to significant fines, or loss of insurance or guarantees on a material number of FFELP loans, or if we lose our ability to service FFELP loans, it could have a material, negative impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur servicing contracts with the Department of Education expose us to additional risks inherent in government contracts and our third-party FFELP loan servicing business is subject to additional risks inherent in government programs.\nThe Federal government could engage in a prolonged debate linking the federal deficit, debt ceiling, government shutdown, and other budget issues. If U.S. lawmakers in the future fail to reach agreement on these issues, the federal government could stop or delay payment on its obligations. Further, legislation to address the federal deficit and spending could impose proposals that would adversely affect the FFEL and Federal Direct Loan Programs' servicing businesses.\nWe contract with the Department to administer loans held by the Department in both the FFEL and Federal Direct Loan Programs, we own a portfolio of FFELP loans, and we service our FFELP loans and loans for third parties. These loan programs are authorized by the Higher Education Act and are subject to periodic reauthorization and changes to the programs by the Administration and U.S. Congress. Any changes, including the potential for borrowers to refinance loans via Direct Consolidation Loans, or broad loan forgiveness, could have a material impact to our cash flows from servicing, interest income, and operating margins. For example, a broad student loan debt cancellation program by the government could result in a significant decrease in our Department servicing revenues and our revenues for servicing FFELP loans for third parties, and even if a broad debt cancellation program only applied to student loans held by the Department, such program could result in a significant increase in consolidations of FFELP loans held by third parties to Federal Direct Loan Program loans, and thus an associated decrease in our third-party FFELP loan servicing revenues.\nGovernment entities in the United States often reserve the right to audit contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of business practices. These entities also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding systems, including systems of third parties, used in connection with the performance of the contracts. Negative findings from audits, investigations, or inquiries could affect the contractor\u2019s future revenues and profitability. If improper or illegal activities are found in the course of government audits or investigations, we could become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act. Additionally, we may be subject to administrative sanctions, which may include termination or non-renewal of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions, or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. Due to the inherent limitations of internal controls, it may not be possible to detect or prevent all improper or illegal activities.\nThe Government could change governmental policies, programs, regulatory environments, spending sentiment, and many other factors and conditions, some of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot predict how or what programs or policies will be impacted by the federal government. The conditions described above could impact not only our contracts with the Department, but also other existing or future contracts with government or commercial entities.\nOur ability to continue to grow and maintain our contracts with commercial businesses and government agencies is partly dependent on our ability to maintain compliance with various laws, regulations, and industry standards applicable to those contracts.\nWe are subject to various laws, regulations, and industry standards related to our commercial and government contracts. In most cases, these contracts are subject to termination rights, audits, and investigations. The laws and regulations that impact our operating segments are outlined in Part I, Item 1, \u201cRegulation and Supervision.\u201d Additionally, our contracts with the federal government require that we maintain internal controls in accordance with the National Institute of Standards and Technologies (\u201cNIST\u201d) and our operating segments that utilize payment cards are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (\u201cPCI DSS\u201d). If we are found to be in noncompliance with the contract provisions or applicable laws, regulations, or standards, or the contracted party exercises its termination or other rights for that or other reasons, our reputation could be negatively affected, and our ability to compete for new contracts or maintain existing contracts could diminish. If this were to occur, our results of operations from existing contracts and future opportunities for new contracts could be negatively affected.\nThe failure to safeguard the privacy of personal information could result in significant legal and reputational harm.\nWe are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations, both inside and outside of the United States, governing the privacy and protection of personal information of individuals. The protected individuals can include our customers, employees, and the customers and employees of our clients, vendors, counterparties, and other third parties. Ensuring the collection, use, transfer, and storage of personal information complies with applicable laws and regulations in relevant jurisdictions can increase operating costs, impact the development of new products or services, and reduce operational efficiency. Any mishandling or misuse of the personal information of customers, employees, or others by us or a third party affiliate could expose us to litigation or regulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions. Additional risks could arise if we or an affiliated third party do not provide adequate disclosure or transparency to our customers about the personal information collected from them and its use; fail to receive, document, and honor the privacy preferences expressed by customers; fail to protect personal information from unauthorized disclosure; or fail to maintain proper training on privacy practices for all employees or third parties who have access to personal data. Concerns regarding the effectiveness of our measures to safeguard personal information and abide by privacy preferences, or even the perception that those measures are inadequate, could cause the loss of existing or potential customers and thereby reduce our revenue. In addition, any failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in requirements to modify or cease certain operations or practices, and/or significant liabilities, regulatory fines, penalties, and other sanctions. The regulatory framework for privacy issues is evolving and is likely to continue doing so for the foreseeable future, which creates uncertainty. Because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws and privacy standards are still uncertain, it is possible that\nthese laws or privacy standards may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations, and privacy standards, could result in additional cost and liability for us, damage our reputation, and harm our business.\nThe failure of Nelnet Bank to achieve business plan results and effectively deploy loan and deposit strategies in accordance with regulatory requirements and its business plan could adversely affect the Bank\u2019s success during its three-year de novo period.\nOn November 2, 2020, Nelnet Bank, our banking subsidiary, launched operations. Nelnet Bank operates as an internet Utah-chartered industrial bank franchise focused on the private education loan marketplace. Nelnet Bank was funded by us with an initial capital contribution of $100.0 million, consisting of $55.9 million in cash and $44.1 million of student loan asset-backed securities. In addition, we made a pledged deposit of $40.0 million with Nelnet Bank, as required under an agreement with the FDIC.\nThe regulatory landscape surrounding industrial banks continues to be scrutinized and banking policy changes may be difficult to predict in advance. Nelnet Bank monitors the regulatory environment and any related changes that may impact the charter or its operations. Nelnet Bank established a three-year business plan, which requires ongoing monitoring to ensure alignment to financial and asset targets as well as other commitments. Failure to meet these targets and commitments could jeopardize the success and profitability of Nelnet Bank.\nThe banking industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory framework, together with any future legislative changes, may have a significant adverse effect on Nelnet Bank\u2019s operations. Nelnet Bank\u2019s current product offerings are primarily concentrated in loan products for higher education, with expected expansion in alignment with the business plan to unsecured consumer lending. Such concentrations and the competitive environment for those products subject the bank to risks that could adversely affect its financial position. Consumer access to alternative means of financing, the costs of education, and other factors may reduce demand for, or adversely affect Nelnet Bank\u2019s ability to, retain private education loans.\nPrior to FDIC approval, Nelnet Bank, Nelnet, Inc. (the parent), and Michael S. Dunlap (Nelnet, Inc.\u2019s controlling shareholder) entered into a Capital and Liquidity Maintenance Agreement and a Parent Company Agreement with the FDIC in connection with Nelnet, Inc.\u2019s role as a source of financial strength for Nelnet Bank. For additional information, see the MD&A - \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Liquidity Impact Related to Nelnet Bank.\u201d However, any failure to meet minimum capital requirements and FDIC regulations can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have material adverse effect on Nelnet Bank\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur failure to successfully manage business and certain asset acquisitions and other investments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.\nWe have expanded our services and products through business acquisitions, and we may acquire other new businesses, products, and services, or enhance existing businesses, products, and services, or make other investments to further diversify our businesses both within and outside of our historical education-related businesses, through acquisitions of other companies, product lines, technologies, and personnel, or through investments in new asset classes. Any acquisition or investment is subject to a number of risks. Such risks may include diversion of management time and resources, disruption of our ongoing businesses, difficulties in integrating acquisitions (including potential delays or errors in converting loan servicing portfolio acquisitions to our servicing platform), loss of key employees, degradation of services, difficulty expanding information technology systems and other business processes to incorporate the acquired businesses, extensive regulatory requirements, dilution to existing shareholders if our common stock is issued in consideration for an acquisition or investment, incurring or assuming indebtedness or other liabilities in connection with an acquisition, unexpected declines in real estate values or the failure to realize expected benefits from real estate development projects, lack of familiarity with new markets, and difficulties in supporting new product lines. Our failure to successfully manage acquisitions or investments, or successfully integrate acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Correspondingly, our expectations as to the accretive nature of the acquisitions or investments could be inaccurate.\nOur significant investments in ALLO and Hudl are subject to a number of risks, including macroeconomic conditions, competition, political and regulatory requirements, technology advancements, cybersecurity threats, retention of key personnel, and other risks. ALLO derives its revenue primarily from the sale of telecommunication services, which are subject to intense competition and extensive federal, state, and local regulations. Additionally, our investment in ALLO is dependent on ALLO maintaining and expanding its infrastructure and continuing to increase market share in existing and new markets. Hudl\u2019s sports performance analysis business is subject to global market conditions, new competition, advancements in technology, and continued demand for their products and services.\nThe operating results of these companies could impact the valuation of these investments on our financial statements, and we may not be able to fully monetize these investments without a liquidation event.\nGeopolitical risks, such as those associated with Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, could result in a decline in the outlook for the U.S. and global economies.\nThe uncertain nature, magnitude, and duration of hostilities stemming from Russia\u2019s recent military invasion of Ukraine, including the potential effects of sanctions and retaliatory cyber-attacks on the world economy and markets, have contributed to increased market volatility and uncertainty, and such geopolitical risks could have an adverse impact on macroeconomic factors which affect our assets and businesses.\nRegulatory and Legal\nFederal and state laws and regulations can restrict our businesses and result in increased compliance expenses, and noncompliance with these laws and regulations could result in penalties, litigation, reputation damage, and a loss of customers.\nOur operating segments are heavily regulated by federal and state government regulatory agencies. See Part I, Item 1, \"Regulation and Supervision.\" The laws and regulations enforced by these agencies are proposed or enacted to protect consumers and the financial industry as a whole, not necessarily us, our operating segments, or our shareholders. We have procedures and controls in place to monitor compliance with numerous federal and state laws and regulations. However, because these laws and regulations are complex, differ between jurisdictions, and are often subject to interpretation, or as a result of unintended errors, we may, from time to time, inadvertently be in non-compliance with these laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations is expensive and requires the time and attention of management. These costs divert capital and focus away from efforts intended to grow our business. If we do not successfully comply with laws, regulations, or policies, we could incur fines or penalties, lose existing or new customer contracts or other business, and suffer damage to our reputation. Changes in these laws and regulations can significantly alter our business environment, limit business operations, and increase costs of doing business, and we cannot predict the impact such changes would have on our profitability.\nFor example, the CFPB has the authority to supervise, examine, and investigate large nonbank student loan servicers, including us. If the CFPB were to determine that we were not in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and CFPB guidance, it is possible that this could result in material adverse consequences, including, without limitation, settlements, fines, penalties, public enforcement actions, adverse regulatory actions, changes in our business practices, or other actions. The CFPB has also issued student loan servicing rules since its inception and continues to review servicing areas where new guidance or rules may be issued in the future.\nThere continues to be uncertainty regarding how the CFPB's recommendations, strategies, and priorities will impact our businesses and our results of operations going forward. Actions by the CFPB could result in requirements to alter our services, causing them to be less attractive or effective and impair our ability to offer them profitably. In the event that the CFPB changes regulations adopted in the past by other regulators, or modifies past regulatory guidance, our compliance costs and litigation exposure could increase.\nSeveral states have enacted laws regulating and monitoring the activity of student loan servicers. For additional information, including risks to us from such state laws, see the paragraph beginning with the same sentence as the immediately preceding sentence that is set forth in Part I, Item 1, \u201cRegulation and Supervision - Loan Servicing and Systems.\u201d\nAs a result of the Reconciliation Act of 2010, our existing FFELP loan portfolio will continue to decline over time.\nThe Reconciliation Act of 2010 discontinued new loan originations under the FFEL Program and requires all new federal loan originations to be made through the Federal Direct Loan Program. Although the new law did not alter or affect the terms and conditions of existing FFELP loans, interest income related to existing FFELP loans will decline over time as existing FFELP loans are paid down, refinanced, or repaid by guaranty agencies after default. We currently believe that in the short term we will not be able to invest the excess cash generated from the FFELP loan portfolio into assets that immediately generate the rates of return historically realized from that portfolio. If we are unable to grow or develop new revenue streams, our consolidated revenue and operating margin will decrease as a result of the decline in FFELP loan volume outstanding.\nExposure related to certain tax issues could decrease our net income.\nFederal and state income tax laws and regulations are often complex and require interpretation. From time to time, we engage in transactions in which the tax consequences may be subject to uncertainty. Significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the tax consequences of these transactions. We prepare and file tax returns based on the interpretation of tax laws\nand regulations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these authorities. In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, we establish reserves for tax contingencies related to deductions and credits that we may be unable to sustain. Differences between the reserves for tax contingencies and the amounts ultimately owed are recorded in the period they become known. Adjustments to our reserves could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nWe may also be impacted by changes in tax laws, including tax rate changes, new tax laws, and subsequent interpretations of tax laws by federal and state tax authorities. For example, any future tax legislation increasing the corporate federal income tax rate and/or limiting deductions could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial results. In addition, several states are in a deficit position. Accordingly, states may look to expand their taxable base, alter their tax calculation, or increase tax rates, which could result in an additional cost to the Company.\nIn addition to corporate tax matters, as both a lender and servicer of student loans, we are required to report student loan interest received and cancellation of indebtedness to individuals and the Internal Revenue Service on an annual basis. These informational forms assist individuals in complying with their federal and state income tax obligations. The statutory and regulatory guidance regarding the calculations, recipients, and timing are complex and we know that interpretations of these rules vary across the industry. The complexity and volume associated with these informational forms creates a risk of error which could result in penalties or damage to our reputation.\nWe invest in certain tax-advantaged projects promoting renewable energy resources (solar projects). Our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal income tax credits, operating cash flows, and other tax benefits, over specified time periods. Our investments in these projects may not generate returns as anticipated and may have an adverse impact on our financial results. We are subject to the risk that tax credits recorded currently and previously, which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level, will fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and will not be able to be realized. The possible inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits can have a negative impact on our financial results. The risk of not being able to realize the tax credits and other tax benefits depends on many factors outside of our control, including changes in the applicable tax code and the ability of the projects to continue operation.\nPrincipal Shareholder and Related Party Transactions\nOur Executive Chairman beneficially owns 81.8 percent of the voting rights of our shareholders and effectively has control over all of our matters.\nMichael S. Dunlap, our Executive Chairman and a principal shareholder, beneficially owns 81.8 percent of the voting rights of our shareholders. Accordingly, each member of the Board of Directors and each member of management has been elected or effectively appointed by Mr. Dunlap and can be removed by Mr. Dunlap. As a result, Mr. Dunlap, as Executive Chairman and controlling shareholder, has control over all of our matters and has the ability to take actions that benefit him, but may not benefit other minority shareholders, and may otherwise exercise his control in a manner with which other minority shareholders may not agree or which they may not consider to be in their best interests.\nOur contractual arrangements and transactions with Union Bank and Trust Company (\"Union Bank\"), which is under common control with us, present conflicts of interest and pose risks to our shareholders that the terms may not be as favorable to us as we could receive from unrelated third parties.\nUnion Bank is controlled by Farmers & Merchants Investment Inc. (\"F&M\"), which owns 81.5 percent of Union Bank's common stock and 15.5 percent of Union Bank's non-voting non-convertible preferred stock. Certain grantor retained annuity trusts established by Mr. Dunlap, a controlling shareholder as well as Executive Chairman of our Board of Directors, and his spouse own a total of 50.4 percent of F&M\u2019s outstanding voting common stock, and a certain grantor retained annuity trust established by Mr. Dunlap\u2019s sister, Angela L. Muhleisen, owns 49.2 percent of F&M\u2019s outstanding voting common stock. In addition, Mr. Dunlap and his family and Ms. Muhleisen and her family own a total of 8.9 percent and 7.9 percent, respectively, of F&M\u2019s outstanding non-voting preferred stock, which amounts are convertible into shares of F&M common stock which would currently represent an additional 3.0 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, of F&M\u2019s outstanding common stock on an as converted basis. Mr. Dunlap serves as a Director and Chairman of F&M, and as a Director of Union Bank. Ms. Muhleisen serves as a Director and Chief Executive Officer of F&M and as a Director, Chairperson, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Union Bank. Union Bank is deemed to have beneficial ownership of a significant number of shares of Nelnet because it serves in a capacity of trustee or account manager for various trusts and accounts holding shares of Nelnet and may share voting and/or investment power with respect to such shares. As of December 31, 2021, Union Bank was deemed to beneficially own 9.8 percent of the voting rights of our outstanding common stock, and Mr. Dunlap and Ms. Muhleisen beneficially owned\n81.8 percent and 11.8 percent, respectively, of the voting rights of our outstanding common stock (with certain shares deemed under applicable SEC rules to be beneficially owned by both Mr. Dunlap and Ms. Muhleisen).\nWe have entered into, and intend to continue entering into, certain contractual arrangements with Union Bank, including loan purchases, loan servicing, loan participations, banking and lending services, 529 Plan administration services, lease arrangements, trustee services, and various other investment and advisory services. The net aggregate impact on our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 related to the transactions with Union Bank was income (before income taxes) of $11.0 million, $15.4 million, and $9.7 million, respectively. See note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information related to the transactions between us and Union Bank.\nWe intend to maintain our relationship with Union Bank, which our management believes provides certain benefits to us. Those benefits include Union Bank's knowledge of and experience in the FFELP industry, its willingness to provide services, and at times liquidity and capital resources, on an expedient basis, and its proximity to our corporate headquarters in Lincoln, Nebraska.\nThe majority of the transactions and arrangements with Union Bank are not offered to unrelated third parties or subject to competitive bids. Accordingly, these transactions and arrangements not only present conflicts of interest, but also pose the risk to our shareholders that the terms of such transactions and arrangements may not be as favorable to us as we could receive from unrelated third parties. Moreover, we may have and/or may enter into contracts and business transactions with related parties that benefit Mr. Dunlap and his sister, as well as other related parties, that may not benefit us and/or our minority shareholders.", "PERMNO": 89964, "SIC": 6141, "TIC": "NNI"}
