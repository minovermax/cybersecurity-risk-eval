{"cik": "103145", "company": "VEECO INSTRUMENTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nKey Risk Factors That May Impact Future Results\nStockholders should carefully consider the risk factors described below. Any of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, and stock price.\nUnfavorable market conditions have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our operating results.\nConditions of the markets in which we operate are volatile and have experienced, and may in the future continue to experience, significant deterioration. Demand for our equipment and services can change depending on several factors, including the nature and timing of technology inflections, the emergence of new technologies and competitors, production capacity and end-user demand, international trade barriers, access to affordable capital, and general economic conditions (including, for example, a prolonged U.S. government shutdown). Changing market conditions require that we continuously monitor and reassess our strategic resource allocation decisions. If we fail to properly adapt to changing business\nenvironments, we may lack the infrastructure and resources necessary to scale up our businesses to successfully compete during periods of growth, or we may incur excess fixed costs during periods of decreasing demand. Adverse market conditions relative to our products have resulted in, and may continue to result in:\n\u25cf reduced demand for our products;\n\u25cf rescheduling and cancellations of orders for our products, resulting in negative backlog adjustments;\n\u25cf asset impairments, including the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;\n\u25cf unfavorable changes in customer mix and product mix;\n\u25cf increased price competition leading to lower margin for our products;\n\u25cf increased competition from sellers of used equipment or lower-priced alternatives to our products;\n\u25cf increased inventory obsolescence;\n\u25cf disruptions in our supply chain as we reduce our purchasing volumes and limit our contract manufacturing operations;\n\u25cf higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues; and\n\u25cf an increase in uncollectable amounts due from our customers resulting in increased reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable.\nIf the markets in which we participate continue to experience deteriorations or downturns, this could negatively impact our sales and revenue generation, margins, operating expenses, and profitability.\nWe are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.\nMost of our sales are to customers located outside of the United States, and we expect sales from non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our sales in the future. Our non-U.S. sales and operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business outside the United States, many of which are beyond our control including:\n\u25cf political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations, and policies within countries that favor local companies over U.S. companies, including government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;\n\u25cf global trade issues and uncertainties with respect to trade policies, including tariffs, trade sanctions, and international trade disputes, and the ability to obtain required import and export licenses;\n\u25cf differing legal systems and standards of trade which may not honor our intellectual property rights and which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u25cf pressures from foreign customers and foreign governments for us to increase our operations and sourcing in the foreign country, which may necessitate the sharing of sensitive information and intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf multiple conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including varying labor laws and tax regulations;\n\u25cf reliance on various information systems and information technology to conduct our business, making us vulnerable to additional cyberattacks by third parties or breaches due to employee error, misuse, or other causes, that could result in further business disruptions, loss of or damage to our intellectual property and confidential information (and that of our customers and other business partners), reputational harm, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, or other adverse consequences;\n\u25cf regional economic downturns, varying foreign government support, unstable political environments, and other changes in foreign economic conditions (such as the United Kingdom\u2019s planned departure from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit);\n\u25cf the impact of public health epidemics on employees, suppliers, customers and the global economy, such as the recent outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China;\n\u25cf difficulties in managing a global enterprise, including staffing, managing distributors and representatives, and repatriating cash;\n\u25cf longer sales cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; and\n\u25cf different customs and ways of doing business.\nThese challenges, many of which are associated with sales into the Asia-Pacific region, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy and export controls and ongoing trade disputes between the U.S. and China have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe U.S. government has recently enacted changes in trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs on certain items, proposed tariffs on additional items, and new export controls. On May 15, 2019, the President of the United States issued an Executive Order that authorized the creation and implementation of controls over transactions involving Chinese and possibly other entities involving threats to U.S. national security. On the same day, the U.S. Commerce Department added Huawei (a multinational technology company with its headquarters in China) and many of its affiliates to the Entity List, which essentially requires U.S. companies and others to obtain licenses before providing commodities, software, and technology subject to the regulations. Further, the Trump Administration has expressed an intent to implement new regulations designed to address concerns about the export of emerging and foundational technologies to China, and additional controls on the export of items to China and other countries may be forthcoming. While the United States and China signed a preliminary \u201cPhase One\u201d trade agreement in January 2020, many uncertainties remain.\nThese new tariffs, and other changes in U.S. trade policy and export controls, as well as sanctions imposed by the U.S. against certain Chinese companies, have triggered retaliatory action by China and could trigger further retaliation. For example, China has instituted trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods, as well as other sanctions designed to deny U.S. companies access to critical raw materials. Also, China has provided, and is expected to continue to provide, significant assistance, financial and otherwise, to their domestic industries, including some of our competitors, and to intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. We face increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the Chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities that is intended to advance China's stated national policy objectives. In addition, the Chinese government may restrict us from participating in the China market or may prevent us from competing effectively with Chinese companies.\nA \u201ctrade war\u201d of this nature or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely affect demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers, and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, we hold inventory of products affected by the recent U.S. government actions and there is uncertainty relating to the disposition of this inventory. While we continue to take steps to mitigate our exposure to this developing situation, if the sale of these products is delayed or we are unable to return or dispose of our inventory on favorable economic terms, we may experience order cancellations, incur additional carrying costs for the inventory or otherwise record losses associated with the inventory.\nIn addition, we have experienced increasing difficulty and uncertainty in obtaining export licenses required to sell products to certain foreign customers. Further, the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) has indicated its intention to eliminate license exception CIV, which we utilize to facilitate the shipment of many of our products to customers in China. Without this license exception, we will be required to obtain export licenses from BIS prior to shipment. This would likely create delay and uncertainty, which would make our products less attractive to customers in China than competing products from suppliers in Europe and elsewhere which do not require an export license for shipment to China. This difficulty and uncertainty has adversely affected our ability to compete for and win business from customers in these foreign jurisdictions.\nForeign customers affected by these and future U.S. government sanctions or threats of sanctions may respond by developing their own solutions to replace our products or by utilizing our foreign competitors\u2019 products.\nTariff and trade policy discussions between the U.S., China and its other trading partners are ongoing and fluid. These tariffs and other policy changes are subject to a number of uncertainties as they are implemented. The ultimate reaction of other countries and the individuals in each of these countries may have an adverse impact on the U.S. and global economies, and our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruptions in our information technology systems or data security incidents could result in significant financial, legal, regulatory, business, and reputational harm to us.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure, including mobile technologies, to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process and transmit significant amounts of sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, personally-identifiable information of individuals, and other confidential information, including that of our customers and other business partners. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of this sensitive information. We have also outsourced elements of our operations (including elements of our information technology infrastructure) to third parties, and as a result, we manage a number of third-party vendors who have access to our computer networks and our confidential information.\nAll information systems are subject to disruption, breach, or failure. Potential vulnerabilities can be exploited from inadvertent or intentional actions of our employees, third-party vendors, business partners, or by malicious third parties. Attacks of this nature are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication, and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives (including industrial espionage), including organized criminal groups, nation states, and others. In addition to the extraction of sensitive information, attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, or other means which could affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Significant disruptions in our, or our third-party vendors\u2019, information technology systems or other data security incidents could adversely affect our business operations and result in the loss or misappropriation of, and unauthorized access to, sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, regulatory, business, and reputational harm to us.\nOn November 1, 2018, we announced the discovery of an attack on our computer system by a highly-sophisticated actor. We notified law enforcement of the attack and retained forensic experts to assist with the investigation. It currently remains unclear whether we will be able to determine the extent of the breach or the potential impact on our operations. Also unclear is whether we will be able to identify who is responsible for the attack, or whether we will be able to pursue legal action or other remedies. The attack, including the expenses incurred to address it, may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, may result in litigation, and may cause reputational harm.\nWhile we are engaged in remediation and have implemented, and are continuing to implement, security measures intended to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such remediation and security measures will successfully prevent further security incidents. Additional information technology system disruptions, whether from attacks on our technology environment or from computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, war or other causes, could result in a material disruption in our business operations, force us to incur significant costs and engage in litigation, harm our reputation, and subject us to liability under laws, regulations, and contractual obligations.\nWe may be unable to effectively enforce and protect our intellectual property rights.\nOur success as a company depends in part upon the protection of our intellectual property rights. We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary information, technologies, processes, and brand identity. We own various U.S. and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to certain of our products and technologies. The process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive, and we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be circumvented,\ninvalidated, or rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or through efforts by others to reverse engineer our products or design around patents that we own. Policing unauthorized use of our products and technologies is difficult and time consuming and the laws of other countries may not protect our proprietary rights as fully or as readily as U.S. laws. Given these limitations, our success will depend in part upon our ability to innovate ahead of our competitors.\nIn addition, our outsourcing efforts require that we share certain portions of our technology with our outsourcing partners, which poses additional risks of infringement and trade secret misappropriation. Infringement of our rights by a third party, possibly for purposes of developing and selling competing products, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities. Similar exposure could result in the event that former employees seek to compete with us through their unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the protective steps and measures we have taken will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary information and technologies, nor can we be certain that applicable intellectual property laws, regulations, and policies will not be changed in a manner detrimental to the sale or use of our products.\nLitigation has been required in the past, is currently ongoing, and may be required in the future, to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, and to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patents, incur substantial costs, and jeopardize relationships with current or prospective customers or suppliers. Any action we take to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights could absorb significant management time and attention, and could otherwise negatively impact our operating results.\nWe may be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement by others.\nWe receive communications from time to time from other parties asserting the existence of patent or other rights which they believe cover certain of our products. We also periodically receive notices from customers who believe that we are required to indemnify them for damages they may incur related to infringement claims made against these customers by third parties. Our customary practice is to evaluate such assertions and to consider the available alternatives, including whether to seek a license, if appropriate. However, we cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained or, if obtained, will be on acceptable terms or that costly litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur. If we are not able to resolve a claim, negotiate a settlement of the matter, obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or successfully prosecute and defend our position, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face significant competition.\nWe face significant competition throughout the world, which may increase as certain markets in which we operate continue to evolve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, engineering, manufacturing, and marketing resources than us. Other competitors are located in regions with lower labor costs and other reduced costs of operation. In addition, our ability to compete in foreign countries against local manufacturers may be hampered by nationalism, social attitudes, laws, regulations, and policies within such countries that favor local companies over U.S. companies or that are otherwise designed to promote the development and growth of local competitors. Furthermore, we face competition from smaller emerging equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services we offer, with a focused approach on innovative technology for specialized markets. New product introductions or enhancements by us or our competitors could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of our existing or prior generation products. Increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price competition resulting in lower margins.\nTo remain competitive, we may enter into strategic alliances with customers, suppliers, and other third parties to explore new market opportunities and possible technological advancements. These alliances may require significant investments of capital and other resources and often involve the exchange of sensitive confidential information. The success of these alliances may depend on factors over which we have limited control and will likely require ongoing cooperation and good faith efforts from our strategic partners. Strategic alliances are inherently subject to significant risks, and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe operate in industries characterized by rapid technological change.\nEach of the industries in which we operate is subject to rapid technological change. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our ability to enhance existing products and develop and manufacture new products in a timely and cost effective manner and to accurately predict technology transitions. New product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales, and we must anticipate the future demand for products when selecting which development programs to fund and pursue. Our financial results depend on the successful introduction of new products, many of which require the achievement of increasingly stringent technical specifications. We may not be successful in selecting, developing, manufacturing, and marketing new products and new technologies or in enhancing our existing products. Our performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to accurately predict evolving market trends and related customer needs and to effectively allocate our resources among new and existing products and technologies.\nWe are also exposed to potential risks associated with unexpected product performance issues. Our product designs and manufacturing processes are complex and could contain unexpected product defects, especially when products are first introduced. Unexpected product performance issues could result in significant costs and damages, including increased service and warranty expenses, the need to provide product replacements or modifications, reimbursement for damages caused by our products, product recalls, related litigation, product write-offs, and disposal costs. Product defects could also result in personal injury or property damage, claims for which may exceed our existing insurance coverages. These and other costs could be substantial and our reputation could be harmed, resulting in a reduced demand for our products and a negative effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCertain of our sales are dependent on the demand for consumer electronics, which can experience significant volatility due to seasonal and other factors.\nThe demand for semiconductors, LEDs, HDDs and other devices is highly dependent on sales of consumer electronics, such as televisions, computers, tablets, digital video recorders, smartphones, cell phones, and other mobile devices. Factors that could influence the levels of spending on consumer electronic products include consumer confidence, access to credit, volatility in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, labor and healthcare costs, and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior. These and other economic factors have had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on the demand for our customers\u2019 products and, in turn, on our customers\u2019 demand for our products and services. Furthermore, in the past, some of our customers have overestimated their potential for market share growth. If this growth is overestimated, we may experience cancellations of orders in backlog, rescheduling of customer deliveries, obsolete inventory, and liabilities to our suppliers for products no longer needed.\nIn addition, the demand for our customers\u2019 products can be even more volatile and unpredictable due to the possibility of competing technologies, such as flash memory as an alternative to HDDs. Unpredictable fluctuations in demand for our customers\u2019 products or rapid shifts in demand from our customers\u2019 products to alternative technologies could materially and adversely impact our future results of operations.\nWe have a concentrated customer base, located primarily in a limited number of regions, which operates in highly concentrated industries.\nOur customer base continues to be highly concentrated. Orders from a relatively limited number of customers have accounted for, and likely will continue to account for, a substantial portion of our net sales, which may allow customers to demand pricing and other terms less favorable to us (including extended warranties, indemnification commitments, and the obligation to continue production of older products). Customer consolidation activity involving some of our largest customers could result in an even greater concentration of our sales in the future. Management changes at key customer accounts could result in a loss of future sales due to vendor preferences or other reasons and may introduce new challenges in managing customer relationships.\nIf a principal customer discontinues its relationship with us or suffers economic setbacks, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to increase sales in the future will depend in part upon our ability to obtain orders from new customers and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these\nefforts. In addition, because a relatively small number of large manufacturers, many of whom are our customers, dominate the industries in which they operate, it may be especially difficult for us to replace these customers if we lose their business. A significant portion of orders in our backlog are orders from our principal customers.\nIn addition, a substantial investment is required by customers to install and integrate capital equipment into a production line. As a result, once a manufacturer has selected a particular vendor to supply capital equipment, the manufacturer will often attempt to consolidate its other capital equipment requirements with the same vendor. Accordingly, if a customer selects a competitor\u2019s product over ours, we could experience difficulty selling to that customer for a significant period of time.\nFurthermore, we do not have long-term contracts with our customers. As a result, our agreements with our customers do not provide assurance of future sales, and we are exposed to competitive price pressures on new orders we attempt to obtain.\nOur customer base is also highly concentrated in terms of geography, and the majority of our sales are to customers located in a limited number of countries. Dependence upon sales emanating from a limited number of regions increases our risk of exposure to local difficulties and challenges, such as those associated with regional economic downturns, political instability, trade wars and other trade disruptions, fluctuating currency exchange rates, natural disasters, social unrest, pandemics, terrorism, and acts of war. Our reliance upon customer demand arising primarily from a limited number of countries could materially and adversely impact our future results of operations.\nThe cyclicality of the industries we serve directly affects our business.\nOur business depends in large part upon the capital expenditures of manufacturers in our four key markets: Front-End Semiconductor; Advanced Packaging, MEMS & RF Filters; LED Lighting, Display & Compound Semiconductor; and Scientific & Industrial. We are subject to the business cycles of these industries, the timing, length, and volatility of which are difficult to predict. These industries have historically been highly cyclical and have experienced significant economic downturns in the last decade. As a capital equipment provider, our revenue depends in large part on the spending patterns of these customers, who often delay expenditures or cancel or reschedule orders in reaction to variations in their businesses or general economic conditions. In downturns, we must be able to quickly and effectively align our costs with prevailing market conditions, as well as motivate and retain key employees. However, because a portion of our costs are fixed, our ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to revenue shortfalls may be limited. Downturns in one or more of these industries have had, and will likely have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Alternatively, during periods of rapid growth, we must be able to acquire and develop sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand and attract, hire, assimilate, and retain a sufficient number of qualified people. Our net sales and operating results may be negatively affected if our customers experience economic downturns or slowdowns in their businesses.\nThe timing of our orders, shipments, and revenue recognition may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our net sales in any fiscal period from the sale of a relatively small number of high-priced systems. As a result, the timing of recognition of revenue for a single transaction could have a material effect on our sales and operating results for a particular fiscal period. As is typical in our industry, orders and shipments often occur during the last few weeks of a quarter. As a result, a delay of only a week or two can impact which period revenue is reported and can cause volatility in our revenue for a given reporting period. Our quarterly results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect this trend to continue. If our orders, shipments, net sales, or operating results in a particular quarter do not meet expectations, our stock price may be adversely affected as well.\nOur sales cycle is long and unpredictable.\nHistorically, we have experienced long and unpredictable sales cycles (the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the time that we recognize revenue for resulting sales to that customer). It is not uncommon for our sales cycle to exceed twelve months. The timing of an order often depends on our customer\u2019s capital expenditure budget, over which we have no control. In addition, the time it takes us to build a product to customer specifications typically\nranges from three to six months. When coupled with the fluctuating amount of time required for shipment, installation, and final acceptance, our sales cycles often vary widely, and these variations can cause fluctuations in our operating results. As a result of our lengthy sales cycles, we may incur significant research, development, selling, general, and administrative expenses before we generate revenue for these products. We may never generate the anticipated revenue if a customer cancels or otherwise changes its purchase plans, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are now confronting many of these risks as we gain traction in the front-end semiconductor market, which is often characterized by long customer qualification times, typically twelve to eighteen months. Once qualified, the ramp to volume production can take an additional extended period of time, often twelve to twenty-four months. During these periods, little to no revenue will be recognized by us, while we will continue to incur research and development costs. Despite our efforts, our products may never be qualified and may never achieve design-tool-of-record (\u201cDTOR\u201d) or production-tool-of-record (\u201cPTOR\u201d) status, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification which could result in decreased sales, increased inventory obsolescence, and liabilities to our suppliers for products no longer needed.\nCustomer purchase orders may be cancelled or rescheduled by the customer, sometimes with limited or no penalties, which may result in increased or unrecoverable costs for the Company. We adjust our backlog for such cancellations, contract modifications, and delivery delays that result in a delivery period in excess of one year, among other items. A downturn in one or more of our businesses could result in an increase in order cancellations and postponements.\nWe write-off excess and obsolete inventory based on historical trends, future usage forecasts, and other factors including the amount of backlog we have on hand. If our backlog is canceled or modified, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated the write-off required for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if we determine that our inventory is overvalued, we will be required to recognize associated costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination. In addition, we place orders with our suppliers based on our customers\u2019 orders. If our customers cancel their orders with us, we may not be able to cancel our orders with our suppliers. Any such charges could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to obtain required export licenses for the sale of our products.\nProducts which are either manufactured in the United States or based on U.S. technology are subject to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d) when exported to and re-exported from international jurisdictions, in addition to the local jurisdiction\u2019s export regulations applicable to individual shipments. Currently, our MOCVD, MBE, and certain other systems and products are controlled for export under the EAR. Licenses or proper license exceptions may be required for the shipment of our products to certain customers or countries (and, as noted above, the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security has indicated its intention to eliminate license exception CIV, which we currently utilize to facilitate the shipment of many of our products to customers in China). Obtaining an export license or determining whether an export license exception exists often requires considerable effort by us and cooperation from the customer, which can add time to the order fulfillment process. We may be unable to obtain required export licenses or unable to qualify for export license exceptions and, as a result, we may be unable to export products to our customers and/or meet their servicing needs. The administrative processing, potential delay and risk of ultimately not obtaining required export approvals pose a particular disadvantage to us relative to our non-U.S. competitors who are not required to comply with U.S. export controls. Non-compliance with the EAR or other applicable export regulations could result in a wide range of penalties including the denial of export privileges, fines, criminal penalties, and the seizure of commodities. In the event that an export regulatory body determines that any of our shipments violate applicable export regulations, we could be fined significant sums and our export capabilities could be restricted, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by tightening credit markets.\nAs a global company with worldwide operations, we are subject to volatility and adverse consequences associated with economic downturns in different parts of the world. In the event of a downturn, many of our customers may delay or reduce their purchases of our products and services. If negative conditions in the credit markets prevent our customers from obtaining credit or necessary financing, product orders in these channels may decrease, which could result in lower revenue.\nIn addition, we may experience cancellations of orders in backlog, rescheduling of customer deliveries, and attendant pricing pressures. If our suppliers face challenges in obtaining credit, in selling their products, or otherwise in operating their businesses, their ability to continue to supply materials to us may be negatively affected.\nIn addition, we finance some of our sales through trade credit. In addition to ongoing credit evaluations of our customers\u2019 financial condition, we seek to mitigate our credit risk by obtaining deposits and letters of credit on certain of our sales arrangements. We could suffer significant losses if a customer whose accounts receivable we have not secured fails or is otherwise unable to pay us, or if financial institutions providing letters of credit become insolvent. A loss in collections on our accounts receivable would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in inventory obsolescence, liabilities to our suppliers for products no longer needed, and manufacturing interruptions or delays which could affect our ability to meet customer demand.\nThe success of our business depends in part on our ability to accurately forecast and supply equipment and services that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of our customers. To meet these demands, we depend on the timely delivery of parts, components, and subassemblies from our suppliers. Uncertain worldwide economic conditions and market instabilities make it difficult for us (and our customers) to accurately forecast future product demand. If actual demand for our products is different than expected, we may purchase more or fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing, or expediting delivery of parts. If we overestimate the demand for our products, excess inventory could result which could be subject to heavy price discounting, which could become obsolete, and which could subject us to liabilities to our suppliers for products no longer needed. Similarly, we may be harmed in the event that our competitors overestimate the demand for their products and engage in heavy price discounting practices as a result. In addition, the volatility of demand for capital equipment poses risks for companies in our supply chain, including challenges associated with inventory management and fluctuating working capital requirements.\nFurthermore, certain key parts may be subject to long lead-times or may be obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing and assembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the United States. We may experience significant interruptions in our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to timely deliver products or services, increased costs, or customer order cancellations as a result of:\n\u25cf the failure or inability of our suppliers to timely deliver quality parts;\n\u25cf volatility in the availability and cost of materials;\n\u25cf difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;\n\u25cf information technology or infrastructure failures;\n\u25cf natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, or storms; or\n\u25cf other causes such as regional economic downturns, international trade disruptions, pandemics, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war, which could result in delayed deliveries, manufacturing inefficiencies, increased costs, or order cancellations.\nIn addition, in the event of an unanticipated increase in demand for our products, our need to rapidly increase our business and manufacturing capacity may be limited by our working capital constraints and those of our suppliers, which may cause or exacerbate interruptions in our manufacturing and supply chain operations. Any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur failure to successfully manage our outsourcing activities or failure of our outsourcing partners to perform as anticipated could adversely affect our results of operations.\nTo better align our costs with market conditions, increase the percentage of variable costs relative to total costs, and to increase productivity and operational efficiency, we have outsourced certain functions to third parties, including the manufacture of several of our systems. While we maintain some level of internal manufacturing capability for these systems, we rely on our outsourcing partners to perform their contracted functions to allow us flexibility to adapt to\nchanging market conditions, including periods of significantly diminished order volumes. If our outsourcing partners do not perform as required, or if our outsourcing efforts do not allow us to realize the intended cost savings and flexibility, our results of operations (and those of our third-party providers) may be adversely affected. Disputes and possibly litigation involving third party providers could result and we could suffer damage to our reputation. Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing may also adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market. Although we attempt to select reputable providers, one or more of these providers could fail to perform as we expect. If we do not effectively manage our outsourcing efforts or if third party providers do not perform as anticipated, we may not realize the benefits of productivity improvements and we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs, manufacturing and installation interruptions or delays, inefficiencies in the structure and operation of our supply chain, loss of intellectual property rights, quality issues, increased product time-to-market, and an inefficient allocation of our human resources, any or all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers, some of whom are our sole source for particular components.\nCertain of the parts, components, and sub-assemblies included in our products are obtained from a single source or a limited group of suppliers. Our inability to develop alternative sources, as necessary, could result in a prolonged interruption in our ability to supply related products, a failure on our part to meet the demands our customers, and a significant increase in the price of related products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe price of our common shares is volatile and could decrease.\nThe stock market in general and the market for technology stocks in particular has experienced significant volatility. The trading price of our common shares has fluctuated significantly and could decline independent of the overall market, and shareholders could lose all or a substantial part of their investment. The market price of our common shares could continue to fluctuate in response to several factors, including among others:\n\u25cf difficult macroeconomic conditions, international trade disputes, unfavorable geopolitical events, and general stock market uncertainties, such as those occasioned by a global liquidity crisis and a failure of large financial institutions;\n\u25cf the emergence of competitors and competing technologies;\n\u25cf receipt of large orders or cancellations of orders for our products;\n\u25cf issues associated with the performance of our products, or the performance of our internal systems such as our customer relationship management (\u201cCRM\u201d) system or our enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;\n\u25cf announcements of financial developments or technological innovations;\n\u25cf our failure to meet the performance estimates of investment research analysts;\n\u25cf changes in recommendations and financial estimates by investment research analysts, and decisions by investment research analysts to cease coverage of our company;\n\u25cf strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, divestitures, and spin-offs, and the results of our investment decisions;\n\u25cf our failure to successfully and timely implement cost reduction initiatives and restructuring activities, if and when required;\n\u25cf the commencement of, and rulings on, litigation and legal proceedings;\n\u25cf the dilutive impact of our Convertible Senior Notes; and\n\u25cf the occurrence of major catastrophic events.\nSecurities class action litigation is often brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We have defended security class actions lawsuits in the past, and are currently defending such a lawsuit now.\nThese lawsuits, if and when brought, can result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which can adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe may be required to take impairment charges on assets.\nWe are required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment, or on an interim basis whenever certain events occur or circumstances change, such as an adverse change in business climate or a decline in the overall industry, that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. We maintain a single reporting unit, and as such, if our stock price decreases to the point where our fair value, as determined by our adjusted market capitalization, is less than the carrying value of our single reporting unit, this would also indicate a potential impairment, and we may be required to record an impairment charge in that period, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Such an impairment charge was taken by the Company during the fourth quarter of 2018, in the amount of $122.8 million.\nAs part of our long term strategy, we may pursue future acquisitions of, or investments in, other companies or assets which could potentially increase our assets. We are required to test certain of our assets, including acquired intangible assets, property, plant, and equipment, and equity investments without readily observable market prices, for recoverability and impairment whenever there are indicators of impairment such as an adverse change in business climate. Adverse changes in business conditions or worse-than-expected performance by these acquired companies could negatively impact our estimates of future operations and result in impairment charges to these assets. For example, during the second quarter of 2018, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $252.3 million related to the intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisition of Ultratech, Inc. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2019 we recorded asset impairment charges of $25.0 million, primarily related to our equity investments without readily observable market prices. If our assets are further impaired, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur inability to attract, retain, and motivate employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees, including those in executive, managerial, engineering and marketing positions, as well as highly skilled and qualified technical personnel. Attracting, retaining, and motivating such qualified personnel may be difficult due to challenging industry conditions, competition for such personnel by other technology companies, consolidations and relocations of operations, and workforce reductions, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in recruiting or retaining key personnel. We have entered into employment agreements with certain key personnel but our inability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions, strategic investments and divestitures.\nWe have completed several significant acquisitions and investments in the past and we will consider new opportunities in the future. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, many of which are unpredictable and beyond our control, including the following:\n\u25cf difficulties and increased costs in integrating the personnel, operations, technologies, and products of acquired companies;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;\n\u25cf the inability to complete proposed transactions as anticipated, resulting in obligations to pay professional and other expenses, including any applicable termination fees;\n\u25cf potential loss of key employees of acquired companies, especially if a relocation or change in responsibilities is involved;\n\u25cf difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations in a cost effective manner;\n\u25cf the failure to realize expected synergies;\n\u25cf unknown, underestimated, and undisclosed commitments or liabilities;\n\u25cf increased amortization expenses relating to intangible assets; and\n\u25cf other adverse effects on our business, including the potential impairment and write-down of amounts capitalized as intangible assets and goodwill as part of the acquisition, as a result of such matters as technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance by the acquired company.\nIf we issue equity securities to pay for an acquisition or investment, the ownership percentage of our then-current shareholders would be reduced and the value of the shares held by these shareholders could be diluted, which could adversely affect the price of our stock. If we use cash to pay for an acquisition or investment, the payment could significantly reduce the cash that would be available to fund our operations, pay our indebtedness, or be used for other purposes, which could have a negative effect on our business.\nIn addition, we continually assess the strategic fit of our businesses and may from time to time seek to divest portions of our business that no longer fit our strategic plan, such as the potential sale of a non-core product line that was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2019. Divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties, including the ability to sell such businesses at satisfactory prices, on acceptable terms, and in a timely manner. Divestitures may also disrupt other parts of our businesses, distract the attention of our management, result in a loss of key employees or customers, and require that we allocate internal resources that would otherwise be devoted to operating our existing businesses. Divestitures may expose us to unanticipated liabilities (including those arising from representations and warranties made to a buyer regarding the businesses) and to ongoing obligations to support the businesses following such divestitures, any and all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to internal control evaluations and attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these requirements or negative reports concerning our internal controls could adversely affect our future results of operations and our stock price.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must include in our Annual Report on Form 10-K a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Ongoing compliance with this requirement is complex, costly, time-consuming, and is subject to significant judgment. If our internal controls are ineffective or if our management does not timely assess the adequacy of such internal controls, our ability to file timely and accurate periodic reports may be impeded. Any delays in filing may cause us to face the following risks and concerns, among others:\n\u25cf concern on the part of our customers, partners, investors, and employees about our financial condition and filing delay status, including the potential loss of business opportunities;\n\u25cf significant time and expense required to complete delayed filings and the distraction of our senior management team and board of directors as we work to complete delayed filings;\n\u25cf investigations by the SEC and other regulatory authorities of the Company and our management;\n\u25cf limitations on our ability to raise capital or possible violations of existing debt covenants;\n\u25cf suspension or termination of our stock listing on The NASDAQ Global Select Market and the removal of our stock as a component of certain stock market indices; and\n\u25cf general reputational harm.\nAny or all of the foregoing could result in the commencement of stockholder lawsuits against the Company. Any such litigation, as well as any proceedings that could arise as a result of a filing delay and the circumstances which gave rise to it, may be time consuming and expensive, may divert management attention from the conduct of our business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and may expose us to costly indemnification obligations to current or former officers, directors, or other personnel, regardless of the outcome of such matters, which may not be adequately covered by insurance.\nChanges in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in accounting pronouncements or taxation rules or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results. New accounting pronouncements and taxation rules can have a material impact on revenue recognition practices, effective tax rates, results of operations, and our financial condition. In addition, varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements or taxation practices, and the questioning of our current or past practices (such as those associated with our transfer pricing), may adversely affect our reported financial results.\nOur income taxes may change.\nWe are subject to income tax on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis and significant judgment is required in certain instances to allocate our taxable income to a jurisdiction and to determine the related income tax expense and benefits. Losses in one jurisdiction generally may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions. As a result, changes in the mix of our earnings (or losses) between jurisdictions, among other factors, could alter our overall effective income tax rate, possibly resulting in significant tax rate increases.\nWe are regularly audited by various tax authorities. Income tax audit assessments or changes in tax laws, regulations, or other interpretations may result in increased tax provisions which could materially affect our operating results in the period or periods in which such determinations are made or changes occur.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate could increase if we determine that it is no longer more likely than not that we are able to realize our remaining net deferred tax assets, if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if we are otherwise required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets.\nWe have indebtedness in the form of convertible senior notes which could adversely affect our financial position, prevent us from implementing our strategy, and dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders.\nIn January of 2017, we issued $345 million of 2.70% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (\u201cConvertible Senior Notes\u201d). The Convertible Senior Notes are convertible into Company common stock at an initial conversion rate of 24.98 shares of Company common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes. The Company is obligated to repurchase the Convertible Senior Notes upon the occurrence of certain events described in the indenture relating to the Convertible Senior Notes. The degree to which we are leveraged could have negative consequences, including but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, less able to withstand competitive pressures, and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate, and other purposes may be limited;\n\u25cf a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations in the future may be required for the payment of the principal amount of our existing indebtedness when it becomes due; and\n\u25cf we may elect to make cash payments upon any conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes, which would reduce our cash on hand.\nOur ability to meet our payment obligations under the Convertible Senior Notes depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that additional capital will be available to us, in an amount sufficient for us to meet our debt payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may be unable to meet our debt payment obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFurthermore, if the Convertible Senior Notes are converted into shares of Company common stock, the issuance of additional shares of Company common stock would dilute the ownership interest of our existing shareholders and could have a dilutive effect on our net income per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of the Convertible Senior Notes. In addition, any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Convertible Senior Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (\u201cASC 470-20\u201d), an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Senior Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting for the Convertible Senior Notes is that the equity component is required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our consolidated balance sheet, and the value of the equity component would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Convertible Senior Notes. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Convertible Senior Notes to their face amount over the term of the Convertible Senior Notes. We will report lower net income in our financial results because ASC 470-20 will require interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon interest, which could adversely affect our financial results, the trading price of our common stock, and the trading price of the Convertible Senior Notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, including our ability and intent to settle the convertible debt instruments in cash, convertible debt instruments (such as the Convertible Senior Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash can be accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted income per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Convertible Senior Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted income per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that we will meet the criteria to utilize the treasury stock method in the future. If we are unable to utilize the treasury stock method, we would be required to apply the if-converted method. Under that method, diluted income per share would generally be calculated assuming that all the Convertible Senior Notes were converted solely into shares of our common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. If we are unable or otherwise elect not to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes, then our diluted income per share would be adversely affected.\nIn July 2019, the FASB issued an exposure draft that proposes to change the accounting for convertible debt instruments, such as the Convertible Senior Notes. Under the exposure draft, an entity may no longer be required to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments. This could have the impact of reducing non-cash interest expense, and thereby increasing net income. Additionally, as currently proposed, the treasury stock method for calculating earnings per share will no longer be allowed for convertible debt instruments whose principal amount may be settled using shares. Rather, the if-converted method may be required, which would adversely affect our diluted net income per share. We cannot be sure that the proposed changes in this exposure draft will be adopted, or will be adopted in their current format. We also cannot be sure whether other changes may be made to the current accounting standards related to the Convertible Senior Notes, or otherwise, that could have an adverse impact on our financial statements.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risks.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks that are inherent in our anticipated sales, sales and purchase commitments, and assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Although we attempt to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, hedging activities may not always be available or adequate to mitigate the impact of our exchange rate exposure. Failure to sufficiently hedge or otherwise manage foreign currency risks properly could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe have adopted certain measures that may have anti-takeover effects which may make an acquisition of our Company by another company more difficult.\nWe have adopted, and may in the future adopt, certain measures that may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a takeover or other change in control of our Company, which a holder of our common stock might not consider to be in the holder\u2019s best interest. These measures include:\n\u25cf \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock;\n\u25cf a classified board of directors; and\n\u25cf certain other provisions appearing in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue up to 500,000 shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights (including voting rights), preferences and privileges of these shares (\u201cblank check\u201d preferred). Such preferred stock may have rights, including economic rights, senior to our common stock. As a result, the issuance of the preferred stock could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock.\nOur board of directors is divided into three classes with each class serving a staggered three-year term. The existence of a classified board makes it more difficult for our shareholders to change the composition of our board of directors, and therefore the Company\u2019s policies, in a relatively short period of time.\nWe have adopted certain certificate of incorporation and bylaws provisions which have anti-takeover effects. These include: (a) requiring certain actions to be taken at a meeting of shareholders rather than by written consent, (b) requiring a super-majority of shareholders to approve certain amendments to our bylaws, (c) limiting the maximum number of directors, and (d) providing that directors may be removed only for cause. These measures and those described above may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a takeover or other change in control of our Company that a holder of our common stock may not consider to be in the holder\u2019s best interest.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination, including mergers and asset sales, with an interested stockholder (generally, a 15% or greater stockholder) for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The operation of Section 203 may have anti-takeover effects, which could delay, defer, or prevent a takeover attempt that a holder of our common stock may not consider to be in the holder\u2019s best interest.\nDespite the above measures, an activist shareholder could undertake action to implement governance, strategic, or other changes to the Company which a holder of our common stock may not consider to be in the holder\u2019s best interest. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plans, be costly and time consuming, disrupt our operations, and divert the attention of management and our employees.\nWe are exposed to various risks associated with global regulatory requirements.\nAs a public company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions, and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. We are required to comply with legal and regulatory requirements pertaining to such matters as data privacy (including, for example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and similar laws), labor laws, immigration, customs, trade, taxes, corporate governance, conflict minerals and other social responsibility legislation, and antitrust regulations, among others. These laws and regulations, which are ever-evolving and at times complex and inconsistent, impose costs on our business and divert management time and attention from revenue-generating activities. Changes to or ambiguities in these laws and regulations may create uncertainty regarding our compliance requirements. While we intend to invest the required resources to comply with these regulatory requirements, if we are found by a court or regulatory agency to have failed in these efforts, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar laws.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign government officials, as defined by the statute, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, many of our customers have policies limiting or prohibiting us from providing certain types or amounts of entertainment, meals, or gifts to their employees. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees and representatives. However, our safeguards may prove to be ineffective and our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors may engage in conduct for which we may be held responsible. In addition, we may acquire a company that has engaged in unlawful conduct in the past, and be held responsible for this conduct through successor liability principles. Violations of the FCPA or similar laws or similar customer policies may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions or the loss of supplier privileges to a customer and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental, health, and safety regulations.\nFrom a corporate governance perspective, there is an increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations. In addition, we are subject to environmental, health, and safety regulations in connection with our business operations, including but not limited to regulations related to the development, manufacture and use of our products, recycling and disposal of related materials, and the operation and use of our facilities and real property. Failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental, safety and sustainability standards and regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities, the imposition of fines, the suspension or termination of research, development, or use of certain of our products, and other harm to the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, some of our operations involve the storage, handling, and use of hazardous materials that may pose a risk of fire, explosion, or environmental release. Such events could result from acts of terrorism, natural disasters, or operational failures and may result in injury or loss of life to our employees and others, local environmental contamination, and property damage. These events may cause a temporary shutdown of an affected facility, or portion thereof, and we could be subject to penalties or claims as a result. Each of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have significant operations in locations which could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, or other significant disruption.\nOur operations in the United States, in the Asia-Pacific region, and in other areas could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including earthquakes, tsunamis, fires, hurricanes, floods, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and severe outbreaks (such as coronavirus), power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, and other natural and manmade disasters or disruptions. In the event of such a natural disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations and to the operations of our suppliers, distributors, resellers and customers, destruction of facilities and loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, various regions of the world in which we do business are subject to the threat of terrorism and acts of war. Any act of terrorism or war that affects the economy or the industries in which we operate could result in significant harm to us, including the loss of life and property, manufacturing and transportation delays, disruptions in our supply chain, the need to comply with enhanced security measures, and other increased costs.", "PERMNO": 81116, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "VECO"}
