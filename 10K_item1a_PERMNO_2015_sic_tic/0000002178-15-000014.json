RISK FACTORS\nEconomic developments could damage operations and materially reduce profitability and cash flows.\nPotential disruptions in the credit markets and concerns about global economic growth could have a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. Such factors could contribute to a decline in the Company\u2019s stock price and corresponding market capitalization. Should commodity prices experience a period of rapid decline, future earnings will be reduced. Since the Company has neither bank debt obligations nor covenants tied to its stock price, potential declines in the Company\u2019s stock price do not affect the Company\u2019s liquidity or overall financial condition. Should the capital and credit markets experience volatility and the availability of funds become limited, the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers may incur increased costs associated with issuing commercial paper and/or other debt instruments and this, in turn, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to secure supply and make profitable sales.\nGeneral economic conditions could reduce demand for chemical based trucking services.\nCustomer demand for the Company\u2019s products and services is substantially dependent upon the general economic conditions for the United States which are cyclical in nature. In particular, demand for liquid chemical truck transportation services is dependent on activity within the petrochemical sector of the U.S. economy. Chemical sector demand typically varies with the housing and auto markets as well as the relative strength of the U.S. dollar to foreign currencies. A relatively strong U.S. dollar exchange rate may be adverse to the Company\u2019s transportation operation since it tends to suppress export demand for petrochemicals. Conversely, a weak U.S. dollar exchange rate tends to stimulate export demand for petrochemicals.\nThe Company\u2019s business is dependent on the ability to obtain trade and other credit.\nThe Company\u2019s future development and growth depends, in part, on its ability to successfully obtain credit from suppliers and other parties. Trade credit arrangements are relied upon as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flow. Should global financial markets and economic conditions disrupt and reduce stability in general, and the solvency of creditors specifically, the availability of funding from credit markets would be reduced as many lenders and institutional investors would enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt on terms similar to current debt or, in some cases, cease to provide funding to borrowers. These issues coupled with weak economic conditions would make it more difficult for the Company and its suppliers and customers to obtain funding. If the Company is unable to obtain trade or other forms of credit on reasonable and competitive terms, the ability to continue its marketing and exploration businesses, pursue improvements, and continue future growth will be limited. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain future credit arrangements on commercially reasonable terms.\nThe financial soundness of customers could affect the Company\u2019s business and operating results\nConstraints in the financial markets and other macro-economic challenges that might affect the economy of the United States and other parts of the world could cause the Company\u2019s customers to experience cash flow concerns. As a result, if customers\u2019 operating and financial performance deteriorates, or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit, customers would not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable owed to the Company. Any inability of current and/or potential customers to pay for services may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nCounterparty credit default could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s revenues are generated under contracts with various counterparties and results of operations could be adversely affected by non-performance under the various contracts. A counterparty\u2019s default or non-performance could be caused by factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. A default could occur as a result of circumstances relating directly to the counterparty, or due to circumstances caused by other market participants having a direct or indirect relationship with such counterparty. The Company seeks to mitigate the risk of default by evaluating the financial strength of potential counterparties; however, despite mitigation efforts, contractual defaults may occur from time to time.\nEscalating diesel fuel prices could have an adverse effect on the Company\nAs an integral part of the Company\u2019s marketing and transportation businesses, the Company operates approximately 500 truck-tractors and diesel fuel costs are a significant component of operating expense. Such costs generally fluctuate with increasing and decreasing world crude oil prices. While the Company attempts to recoup rising diesel fuel costs through the pricing of its services, to the extent such costs escalate, operating earnings will generally be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in oil and gas prices could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s future financial condition, revenues, results of operations and future rate of growth are materially affected by oil and natural gas prices that historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. Moreover, oil and natural gas prices depend on factors outside the control of the Company. These factors include:\n\u00b7\nsupply and demand for oil and gas and expectations regarding supply and demand;\n\u00b7\npolitical conditions in other oil-producing countries, including the possibility of insurgency or war in such areas;\n\u00b7\neconomic conditions in the United States and worldwide;\n\u00b7\ngovernmental regulations and taxation;\n\u00b7\nimpact of energy conservation efforts;\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of alternative fuel sources;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions;\n\u00b7\navailability of local, interstate and intrastate transportation systems; and\n\u00b7\nmarket uncertainty.\nRevenues are generated under contracts that must be renegotiated periodically.\nSubstantially all of the Company\u2019s revenues are generated under contracts which expire periodically or which must be frequently renegotiated, extended or replaced. Whether these contracts are renegotiated, extended or replaced is often subject to factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. Such factors include sudden fluctuations in oil and gas prices, counterparty ability to pay for or accept the contracted volumes and, most importantly, an extremely competitive marketplace for the services offered by the Company. There is no assurance that the costs and pricing of the Company\u2019s services can remain competitive in the marketplace or that the Company will be successful in renegotiating its contracts.\nAnticipated or scheduled volumes will differ from actual or delivered volumes.\nThe Company\u2019s crude oil marketing operation purchases initial production of crude oil at the wellhead under contracts requiring the Company to accept the actual volume produced. The resale of such production is generally under contracts requiring a fixed volume to be delivered. The Company estimates its anticipated supply and matches such supply estimate for both volume and pricing formulas with committed sales volumes. Since actual wellhead volumes produced will never equal anticipated supply, the Company\u2019s marketing margins may be adversely impacted. In many instances, any losses resulting from the difference between actual supply volumes compared to committed sales volumes must be absorbed by the Company.\nEnvironmental liabilities and environmental regulations may have an adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to environmental hazards such as spills, leaks or any discharges of petroleum products and hazardous substances. These environmental hazards could expose the Company to material liabilities for property damage, personal injuries, and/or environmental harms, including the costs of investigating and rectifying contaminated properties.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations govern many aspects of the Company\u2019s business, such as drilling and exploration, production, transportation and waste management. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant costs or may require a decrease in production. Moreover, noncompliance with these laws and regulations could subject the Company to significant administrative, civil, and/or criminal fines and/or penalties.\nOperations could result in liabilities that may not be fully covered by insurance.\nTransportation of hazardous materials and the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts, automobile accidents, explosions, fires and pollution. Any of these operating hazards could cause serious injuries, fatalities or property damage, which could expose the Company to liability. The payment of any of these liabilities could reduce, or even eliminate, the funds available for exploration, development, and acquisition, or could result in a loss of the Company\u2019s properties and may even threaten survival of the enterprise.\nConsistent with the industry standard, the Company\u2019s insurance policies provide limited coverage for losses or liabilities relating to pollution, with broader coverage provided for sudden and accidental occurrences. Insurance might be inadequate to cover all liabilities. Moreover, from time to time, obtaining insurance for the Company\u2019s line of business can become difficult and costly. Typically, when insurance cost escalates, the Company may reduce its level of coverage and more risk may be retained to offset cost increases. If substantial liability is incurred and damages are not covered by insurance or exceed policy limits, the Company\u2019s operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department, Congress and the states frequently review federal or state income tax legislation. The Company cannot predict whether, when, or to what extent new federal or state tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any such legislative action may prospectively or retroactively modify tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to changing government regulations.\nFederal, state or local government agencies may impose environmental, labor or other regulations that increase costs and/or terminate or suspend operations. The Company\u2019s business is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations. These regulations relate to, among other things, the exploration, development, production and transportation of oil and natural gas. Existing laws and regulations could be changed, and any changes could increase costs of compliance and costs of operations.\nSeveral proposals are before state legislators and the U.S. Congress that, if implemented, would either prohibit the practice of hydraulic fracturing or subject the process to regulation under state regulation or the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Company routinely participates in wells where fracturing techniques are utilized to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the well-bore. This is typically done at substantial depths in very tight formations. Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new state or federal restrictions could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions.\nEstimating reserves, production and future net cash flow is difficult.\nEstimating oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process requiring significant interpretations of technical data and assumptions relating to economic factors such as future commodity prices, production costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures and remedial costs, and the assumed effect of governmental regulation. As a result, actual results may differ from the Company\u2019s estimates. Also, the use of a 10 percent discount factor for reporting purposes, as prescribed by the SEC, may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount factor, given actual interest rates and risks to which the Company\u2019s business is subject. Any significant variations from the Company\u2019s valuations could cause the estimated quantities and net present value of the Company\u2019s reserves to differ materially.\nThe reserve data included in this report is only an estimate. The reader should not assume that the present values referred to in this report represent the current market value of the Company\u2019s estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The timing of the production and the expenses from development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect both the timing of actual future net cash flows from the Company\u2019s proved reserves and their present value.\nThe Company\u2019s exploration operations are dependent on the ability to replace reserves.\nFuture success depends in part on the Company\u2019s ability to find, develop and acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves. Absent ongoing successful acquisition or exploration activities, reserves and revenues will decline as a result of current reserves being depleted by production. The successful acquisition, development or exploration of oil and natural gas properties is dependent upon an assessment of recoverable reserves, future oil and natural gas prices and operating costs, potential environmental and other liabilities, and other factors. These factors are necessarily inexact. As a result, the Company may not recover the purchase price and/or the development costs of a property from the sale of production from the property, or may not recognize an acceptable return from properties acquired. In addition, exploration and development operations may not result in any increases in reserves. Exploration or development may be delayed or cancelled as a result of inadequate capital, compliance with governmental regulations, price controls or mechanical difficulties. In the future, the cost to find or acquire additional reserves may become prohibitive.\nOil and gas segment revenues are dependent on the ability to successfully complete drilling activity.\nDrilling and exploration are one of the main methods of replacing reserves. However, drilling and exploration operations may not result in any increases in reserves for various reasons. Drilling and exploration may be curtailed, delayed or cancelled as a result of:\n\u00b7\nlack of acceptable prospective acreage;\n\u00b7\ninadequate capital resources;\n\u00b7\nweather;\n\u00b7\ntitle problems;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with governmental regulations; and\n\u00b7\nmechanical difficulties.\nMoreover, the costs of drilling and exploration may greatly exceed initial estimates. In such a case, the Company would be required to make additional expenditures to develop its drilling projects. Such additional and unanticipated expenditures could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity issues exist relating to drivers, equipment and terminal facilities.\nThe Company transports liquid combustible materials including petrochemicals, and such materials may be a target for terrorist attacks. While the Company employs a variety of security measures to mitigate risks, no assurance can be given that such events will not occur.\nCurrent and future litigation could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company is currently involved in certain administrative and civil legal proceedings as part of the ordinary course of its business. Moreover, as incidental to operations, the Company sometimes becomes involved in various lawsuits and/or disputes. Lawsuits and other legal proceedings can involve substantial costs, including the costs associated with investigation, litigation and possible settlement, judgment, penalty or fine. Although insurance is maintained to mitigate these costs, there can be no assurance that costs associated with lawsuits or other legal proceedings will not exceed the limits of insurance policies. The Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected if a judgment, penalty or fine is not fully covered by insurance.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with climate change.\nPotential climate change and efforts to regulate \u201fgreenhouse gas\u201d (\u201fGHG\u201d) emissions have the potential to adversely affect the Company\u2019s business including negatively impacting the costs it incurs in providing its products and services, including costs to operate and maintain its facilities, install new emission controls on its facilities, acquire allowances to authorize its GHG emissions, pay any taxes related to GHG emissions, administer and manage a GHG emissions program, pay higher insurance premiums or accept greater risk of loss in areas affected by adverse weather and coastal regions in the event of rising sea levels. In addition, the demand for and consumption of its products and services (due to change in both costs and weather patterns), and the economic health of the regions in which the Company operates, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to risks related to cybersecurity.\nThe Company is subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in connection with its efforts to enhance and ensure security and in response to actual or attempted cybersecurity attacks.\nSubstantial aspects of the Company\u2019s business depend on the secure operation of its computer systems and websites. Security breaches could expose the Company to a risk of loss, misuse, or interruption of sensitive and critical information and functions, including its own proprietary information and that of its customers, suppliers and employees. Such breaches could result in operational impacts, reputational harm, competitive disadvantage, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, and liability. While the Company devotes substantial resources to maintaining adequate levels of cybersecurity, there can be no assurance that it will be able to prevent all of the rapidly evolving types of cyber attacks. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause the Company to incur increasing costs for technology, personnel and services to enhance security or to respond to occurrences.\nIf the Company\u2019s security measures are circumvented, proprietary information may be misappropriated, its operations may be disrupted, and its computers or those of its customers or other third parties may be damaged. Compromises of the Company\u2019s security may result in an interruption of operations, violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to its reputation, and a loss of confidence in its security measures.", "PERMNO": 61487, "SIC": 5172, "TIC": "AE"}
