{"cik": "1196501", "company": "HMS HOLDINGS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business that, individually or in the aggregate, may cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You should consider these factors, but understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider the following to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties involved with investing in our stock. These risk factors should be read in connection with other information set forth in this Annual Report, including our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nChanges in the United States healthcare environment, or in laws relating to healthcare programs and policies, and steps we take in anticipation of such changes, particularly as they relate to the ACA and the Medicare and Medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe healthcare industry in the United States is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement practices and operations of federal, state and private healthcare organizations and agencies. In general, the ACA seeks to decrease over time the number of uninsured legal U.S. residents. Because of the ACA's strong emphasis on program integrity and cost containment, as well as provisions expanding the Medicaid-eligible population, we regard this legislation, on the whole, as creating potential new opportunities for the expansion of our business and service offerings. Until the ACA has been fully implemented, however, it will be difficult to predict its full impact and influence on future changes to Medicare policy, due not only to its complexity, but also to the wide range of other factors contributing to uncertainty of the healthcare landscape. These factors include the unpredictability of responses by states, providers, businesses and other entities to the various choices available to them under the law; the possibility that implementation of certain provisions of the legislation could still be blocked by court challenges, repealed by Congressional efforts or as a result of Supreme Court decisions or otherwise modified at the state level; and the increase in lobbying efforts from established provider organizations for further adverse changes to the Medicare RAC Program.\nIn addition, under the ACA, as states seek to contain costs with an expanding Medicaid population, we expect to continue to see an increase in the migration of Medicaid lives from fee-for-service to managed care plans. While we provide services to both types of Medicaid plans, we have historically had more success in providing services to states utilizing fee-for-service plans. The transition of Medicaid lives from fee-for-service to managed care requires that we commit more resources to attaining larger amounts of business from managed care plans.\nWe have made and will continue to make investments in personnel, infrastructure and product development, as well as in the overall expansion of the services that we offer in order to support existing and new customers as they implement the requirements of the ACA. However, future changes to the ACA and to the Medicare and Medicaid programs may also lower reimbursement rates, establish new payment models, increase or decrease government involvement in healthcare, decrease the Medicare RAC Program and/or otherwise change the operating environment for our customers. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected if efforts to waive, modify or otherwise change the ACA, in whole or in part, are successful, if we are unable to adapt our products and services to meet changing requirements or expand service delivery into new areas, or the demand for our services is reduced as a result of healthcare organizations' reactions to changed circumstances and financial pressures.\nHealthcare organizations may react to such changed circumstances and financial pressures, including those surrounding the implementation of the ACA, by taking actions such as curtailing or deferring their retention of service providers like us, which could reduce the demand for our services and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nHealthcare spending fluctuations, simplification of the healthcare payment process or other aspects of the healthcare financing system, budgetary pressures and/or programmatic changes diminishing the scope of program benefits, or limiting payment integrity initiatives, could reduce the need for and the price of our services, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur projections and expectations are premised upon consistent growth rates in spending in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the current healthcare financing system and the need for our services within that existing framework. It is expected that enrollment in government healthcare programs will\ncontinue to grow, particularly under the ACA. There are a number of factors that could impact our projections, including medical utilization by the new enrollees under the ACA and any legislative action taken to reduce spending. Compounding this are budgetary pressures that may drive changes at the state level, including shifting lives from traditional fee-for-service plans into Medicaid managed care plans to achieve cost savings.\nOur experience in offering services that improve the ability of our customers to recover revenue that would otherwise be lost, often as a result of procedural inefficiencies and complexities, have contributed to the success of our service offerings. Although the complexities of the healthcare benefit and payment system continue to grow (due to factors such as the expansion of pay-for-performance programs), the need for our services, the price customers are willing to pay for them and/or the scope and profitability of our contracts could be negatively affected by: lower than projected growth in the Medicare and Medicaid programs; a simplification of the healthcare benefit and payment system through legislative or regulatory changes at the federal or state level (for example, legislative changes impacting the scope of mandatory audits, limiting or reducing the amount of reviewable claims and/or the look-back period for review in areas where we conduct audits); unanticipated reductions in the scope of program benefits (such as, for example, state decisions to eliminate coverage of optional Medicaid services or shifting lives into managed care plans); and/or limits placed on ongoing program integrity initiatives (for example, in February 2014, CMS announced a \"pause\" in operations of the Medicare RAC Program). Modifications in provider billing behavior and habits, often in response to the success of our services, could also reduce the profitability of our contracts and reduce the need for our services. Any of these factors could cause our financial projections to differ from our actual results, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operating results are subject to significant fluctuations due to factors including variability in the timing of when we recognize contingency fee revenue and the challenges associated with forecasting revenue for new products and services. As a result, you will not be able to rely on our operating results in any particular period as an indication of our future performance.\nOur operating results may fail to match our past or projected performance. We have experienced significant variations in our revenue between reporting periods due to the timing of periodic revenue recovery projects, the timing and delays in third party payers' claim adjudication and ultimate payment to our customers where our fees are contingent upon such collections and delays in receiving payment for our services. Our revenue and operating results have also been impacted from period to period as a result of a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 fluctuations in sales activity given our sales cycle of approximately six to eighteen months;\n\u2022 the commencement, completion or termination of contracts during any particular quarter;\n\u2022 expenses related to certain contracts which may be incurred in periods prior to revenue being recognized;\n\u2022 the timing of government contract awards;\n\u2022 the time required to resolve bid protests;\n\u2022 contract renewal discussions, which result in delayed payments for previously provided services;\n\u2022 technological and operational issues affecting our customers, including delays in payment receipt for previously recognized revenue due to delays in certain customers processing our findings through their systems;\n\u2022 adjustments to age/quality of receivables and accruals as a result of delays involving contract limitations and changes or subcontractor performance deficiencies or internal managerial decision not to pursue identified claim revenue from customers; and\n\u2022 regulatory changes or general economic conditions as they affect healthcare providers and payers.\nIn addition, as we introduce new products and services, we may not be able to accurately estimate the costs and timing for implementing and completing contracts, making it difficult to reliably forecast revenue under those contracts. We cannot predict the extent to which future revenue variations could occur due to these or other factors. Consequently, our results of operations are subject to significant fluctuation and our results of operations for any particular quarter or fiscal year may not be indicative of results of operations for future periods.\nOur ability to execute on business plans will be adversely affected if we fail to properly manage our growth.\nIn recent years, our size and the scope of our business operations have expanded rapidly, and we expect that we will continue to grow and expand into new areas within the government and commercial healthcare space; however, such growth and expansion carries costs and risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely affect our business. To effectively manage our business plans, we must continue to improve our operations, while remaining competitive. We must also be flexible and responsive to our customers' needs and to changes in the political, economic and regulatory environment in which we operate. The greater size and complexity of our expanding business puts additional strain on our administrative, operational and financial resources and makes the determination of optimal resource allocation more difficult. A failure to anticipate or properly address the demands that our growth and diversification may have on our resources and existing infrastructure may result in unanticipated costs and inefficiencies and could negatively impact our ability to execute on our business plans and growth goals, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we fail to maintain a high level of customer retention, lose a major customer or fail to reprocure a contract, or if customers elect to reduce the scope of our contracts or terminate them before their scheduled expiration dates.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of large customers at the federal and state level. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, our three largest customers accounted for 19.8%, 32.5% and 29.8%, respectively, of our revenue from continuing operations.\nOne of our largest customers in 2014 was CMS, primarily related to our Medicare RAC contract through our wholly owned subsidiary HDI, which after a series of contract modifications, now expires on December 31, 2015. In February 2013, CMS began the reprocurement process for the Medicare RAC Program contracts. After a protest was filed on the initial Request for Quote (\"RFQ\"), CMS took corrective action and, between December 2013 and January 2014, issued five new RFQs for the Medicare RAC Program contracts. HDI and one of HDI's prospective competitors protested certain terms of the new RFQs, and these protests were denied by the Government Accountability Office (\"GAO\") in April 2014. On April 28, 2014, HDI's prospective competitor filed a lawsuit at the U.S. Court of Federal Claims challenging the terms of the solicitations for CMS Regions 1, 2, and 4 and seeking an injunction against CMS. On August 21, 2014, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims entered judgment in favor of the GAO and HDI's prospective competitor appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on August 26, 2014. On September 2, 2014, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims granted a stay that prohibited CMS from awarding contracts for Regions 1, 2, and 4 pending the outcome of the appeal.\nUnder the existing Medicare RAC contracts, on February 18, 2014, CMS announced its decision to pause the operations of the current Medicare RACs establishing June 1, 2014 as the last day that RAC contractors could transmit improper payment files for processing. On August 4, 2014, CMS announced that due to the continued delay in awarding new Recovery Auditor contracts, it was initiating contract modifications to allow the Medicare RACs to restart certain reviews through December 31, 2014. CMS stated that most reviews will be done on an automated basis, but a limited number will be complex reviews\nof topics selected by CMS. On January 12, 2015, we entered into a new modification that extended our auditing services to CMS through December 31, 2015 and requires us to assist CMS with the appeals process through April 30, 2017.\nGiven that HDI's Medicare RAC contract with CMS is one of our largest contracts and represents a significant potential business opportunity for us, if HDI is not awarded a region, or is awarded a region but on substantially different terms from HDI's current contract, or if the contract awards continue to be delayed, or if CMS imposes or implements other changes to the Medicare RAC Program that materially reduce our revenue or profitability associated with such program, then our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be materially adversely affected.\nIn August 2013, CMS issued CMS Rule 1599-F Hospital Inpatient Admission Order and Certification and Two Midnight Benchmark for Inpatient Hospital Admissions for the Fiscal Year 2014 Inpatient Prospective Payment System (\"IPPS\")/Long-Term Care Hospital (\"LTCH\"). Under this final rule, CMS redefined the requirements for an inpatient stay with a new formal time-based standard. The new rule, termed the \"Two Midnight Rule,\" states that surgical procedures, diagnostic tests and other treatments (in addition to services designated as inpatient-only), are generally appropriate for inpatient hospital admission and payment under Medicare Part A when a physician (i) expects the beneficiary to require a stay that crosses at least two midnights, and (ii) admits the beneficiary to the hospital based upon that expectation. As part of the implementation of the new rule, effective October 2013, CMS suspended the review by Medicare RACs of inpatient hospital claims paid between October 1, 2013 and September 30, 2014 for a determination of whether the inpatient hospital admission and patient status was appropriate. In connection with this audit suspension, CMS announced that it had initiated a provider education and compliance review program and stated that it would re-evaluate the retrospective review strategy after it evaluated the results of the compliance review. On April 1, 2014, the \"Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014,\" was signed into law. A provision of this act further delayed the Two Midnight Rule's enforcement and RAC review of Two Midnight Rule claims until March 31, 2015.\nThese reviews have historically been a significant finding for the Recovery Audit Program; as a result, the Two Midnight Rule and the suspension of these reviews by the Medicare RACs could have a material negative impact on our future revenue if HDI is awarded a new Medicare RAC Contract, depending upon, among other factors, how the Two Midnight Rule is applied by providers and the review strategies ultimately approved by CMS.\nIn addition, on August 29, 2014, CMS announced it would settle with hospitals willing to withdraw inpatient status claims currently pending in the appeals process by offering to pay hospitals 68% for all eligible claims that they have billed to Medicare. Although we accrue an estimated liability for appeals based on the amount of fees that are subject to appeals, closures or other adjustments, which we estimate are probable of being returned to providers following a successful appeal, and we similarly accrue an allowance against accounts receivables related to fees yet to be collected, the impact of CMS' settlement offer to hospitals remains uncertain and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we are required to return certain fees we have already been paid under HDI's existing Medicare RAC contract or we are unable to collect fees for audits we have already performed. There could be a material negative impact on our revenue if under the current Medicare RAC contract, HDI is unable to obtain full payments for properly provided services or is required to repay a portion of prior fees associated with the hospital settlement program or if future fees payable to HDI by CMS are reduced.\nOur success also depends on relationships we develop with our customers that enable us to understand our customers' needs and deliver solutions and services that are tailored to meet those needs. If a customer is dissatisfied with the quality of our work, or if our products, technical infrastructure or services do not comply with the provisions of our contractual agreements or applicable regulatory requirements, we could incur additional costs that may impair the profitability of a contract and damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer, or other current or prospective customers. For\nexample, some of our contracts contain liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to performance failures, which if triggered, could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If liquidated damages or other financial penalties are assessed against us, we may be required to disclose these damages or penalties in connection with future bids for services with other customers, which may reduce our chances of winning such procurements. Although we have liability insurance, the policy coverage and limits may not be adequate to provide protection against all potential liabilities. Under the terms of one of our contracts, we have an outstanding irrevocable letter of credit for $4.6 million, which we established against our existing revolving credit facility. If a claim is made against this letter of credit or any similar instrument that we obtain in the future, we would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit for the amount of the claim.\nFrom time to time, government customers may face financial pressures or pressure from stakeholders that may cause them to redefine or reduce the scope of our contracts (by, for example, significantly reducing the volume of data that we are permitted to audit) or terminate contracts for our services that may be regarded as non-essential. We also occasionally face challenges in obtaining timely or full payments for our properly provided services from customers and parties who we provide services to, despite our right to prompt and full payment under the terms of our contracts. Since several of our contracts, including those with many of our largest customers, may be terminated upon short notice for convenience, dissatisfied customers might seek to exit existing contracts prior to their scheduled expiration date and could direct future business to our competitors.\nIf we lose a major customer; if we fail to maintain a high level of customer retention; if we fail to reprocure a contract; if our customers reduce the scope of our contracts or limit future contracting opportunities; or if we are exposed to significant costs, liabilities or negative publicity, our ability to compete for new contracts with current or prospective customers could be damaged and our business, financial condition, reputation, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face significant competition for our services and we expect competition to increase.\nCompetition among U.S. healthcare insurance benefit cost containment service providers is increasing and we expect to encounter additional competition as new competitors enter this area as it continues to grow with advances in technology. Our current competitors include the other Medicare RACs; other claim audit vendors; fraud, waste and abuse claim edit and predictive analysis companies; primary claims processors; numerous regional utilization management companies; as well as healthcare consulting firms and other third-party liability service providers. In addition, some customers can compete by electing to perform some or all of their recovery and cost avoidance functions in-house.\nWe must remain competitive with our existing business and service capabilities and develop new products and services, which will require not only that we make substantial financial and resource investments, but that we quickly respond to new or emerging technologies and to changes in customer requirements and the healthcare industry. There is also increasing sophistication in certain services and our competitors are constantly developing products and services that may become more efficient or appealing to our customers. We cannot provide assurance that our new or modified product and service innovations will be responsive to customer preferences or industry changes, or that the product development initiatives that we prioritize will yield the gains that we anticipate, if any.\nMany of the cost containment services we provide are being targeted by formidable competitors with national reputations, and their success in attracting business or winning contract bids could significantly and/or adversely affect our business. In addition, for some of the services that we provide or hope to provide, current and prospective customers could develop in-house capacities and could therefore decide not to engage us. Some of our competitors have also merged or formed business alliances with other competitors, which may affect our ability to work with potential customers. In certain cases, our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater resources and market recognition than we\nhave, and may be in a position to bundle services that compete with our product and services offerings, or may be able to devote greater resources to the sale of their services and to developing and implementing new and improved systems and solutions for the customers that we serve. In some areas of our business, we could face potential competition from our current or former subcontractors or teaming partners, who may use their position to establish their own relationships with our customers and seek to become prime contractors on similar work in the future. Although we attempt to protect ourselves against such conduct through the terms of our subcontracts and teaming agreements, a subcontractor or teaming partner may determine that the benefits of violating its contract with us outweigh the costs and risks.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competitors. In addition, we may be forced to lower our pricing or the demand for our services may decrease as a result of increased competition. Further, a failure to be responsive to our existing and potential customers' needs could hinder our ability to maintain or expand our customer base, hire and retain new employees, pursue new business opportunities, complete future acquisitions and operate our business effectively. Any inability to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe must comply with laws and regulations regarding individual privacy and information security, including taking steps to ensure that our workforce, vendors, subcontractors and other business associates who obtain access to sensitive information about individuals maintain its confidentiality. Our failure, or a failure by our business associates, to comply with those laws and regulations, whether or not inadvertent, could subject us to legal actions, fines and penalties and negatively impact our reputation and operations.\nAs a service provider, we often receive, process, transmit and store protected health information (\"PHI\") of individuals, as well as other financial, confidential and proprietary information belonging to our customers, our subsidiaries and third parties (e.g., private insurance companies, financial institutions) from which we obtain information. The use and disclosure of that information is regulated through federal and state laws and rules, which are changed frequently by legislation, regulatory issuances and/or administrative interpretation. Various state laws address the use and disclosure of individually identifiable financial and health data. Some are derived from the privacy and security provisions such as in the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"HIPAA\"), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\"HITECH\"), and the regulations implementing these laws. HIPAA also imposes standards and requirements on our business associates (as this term is defined in the HIPAA regulations), including our subcontractors and many of our vendors.\nIn January 2013, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued Final Omnibus Privacy, Security, Breach Notification, and Enforcement Rules that modified and supplemented many of the standards and regulations under HIPAA and HITECH. These new rules significantly increased the risk of liability to us and our business associates and subcontractors and made more incidents of inadvertent disclosure reportable and subject to penalties. Even though we take measures to comply with all applicable regulations and to ensure our business associates and subcontractors comply with these laws, regulations and rules, we have less than complete control over our business associates' and subcontractors' actions and practices. In addition, we could also be exposed to data breach risk if there is unauthorized access to one of our or our subcontractors' secure facilities or from lost or stolen laptops, other portable media from current or former employee theft of data containing PHI, from misdirected mailings containing PHI, or other forms of administrative or operational error. If we or our subcontractors fail to comply with applicable laws; if unauthorized parties gain physical access to one of our facilities and steals or misuses confidential information; if we erroneously use or disclose data in a way that is inconsistent with our granted rights; or if such information is misdirected, lost or stolen during transmission or transport, we may suffer damage to our reputation, potential loss of existing customers and difficulty attracting new customers. We could also be exposed to, among other things, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry\nand oversight, allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations, costs to provide notifications to affected individuals, or litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for damages or indemnification obligations related to the theft or misuse of such information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, as regulatory focus on privacy issues continues to increase and laws and regulations concerning the protection of personal information expand and become more complex, these potential risks to our business could intensify. Changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as healthcare data or other personally identifiable information, along with increased customer demands for enhanced data security infrastructure, could greatly increase our cost of providing our services. See Risk Factor-\"Our systems and networks may be subject to cyber security breaches and other disruptions that could compromise our information and harm our business\" for additional information.\nOur business depends on effective information processing systems that are compliant with current HIPAA transaction and code set standards and the integrity of the data in, and operations of, our information systems, as well as those of other entities that provide us with data or receive data from us.\nOur ability to conduct our operations and accurately report our financial results depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems and the integrity of the processes performed by those systems. These information systems and applications require continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs, satisfy customer requests and handle our expansion and growth. Despite our testing and quality control measures, we cannot be certain that errors or system deficiencies will not be found and that remediation can be done in a timeframe that is acceptable to our customers or that customer relationships will not be impaired by the occurrence of errors or the need for remediation. In addition, implementation of upgrades and enhancements may cost more, take longer or require more testing than originally expected. Given the large amount of data we collect and manage, it is possible that hardware failures or errors or technical deficiencies in our systems could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect, utilize or disseminate to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant.\nThrough several of the services we provide, situations arise in which the accuracy of our data analysis or the content and quality of our work product is central to the disposition of claims, controversies or litigation between our customers and third parties. When such situations arise, we may be required to allocate significant resources to fulfilling our contractual obligations to provide our customers with full and complete access to records, analysis and back-up documentation of our work. Assuring our capacity to fulfill these obligations, as well as actually fulfilling such obligations, can impose significant burdens on our infrastructure for data storage, maintenance and processing, requiring us to prioritize maintenance of and access to these resources, or incur additional costs to supplement them in order to satisfy our obligations. Should the frequency or scope of situations in which customers invoke these obligations increase to a substantial degree, the resulting strain on our personnel, data storage and computing resources could negatively impact other business operations.\nMoreover, because many of the services we furnish to customers involve submitting high volumes of monetary claims to third parties (such as health insurance carriers) and processing payments from them, the efficiency and effectiveness of our own operations are to some degree dependent on the claims processing systems of these third parties and their compliance with any new transaction and code set standards. By October 1, 2015, health plans, commercial payers and healthcare providers are required to transition to the new ICD-10 coding system, which greatly expands the number and detail of diagnosis codes used for inpatient, outpatient and physician claims. The transition to the new transaction and code set standard is expensive, time-consuming and may initially result in disruptions or delays as we and other stakeholders make necessary system adjustments to be fully compliant and capable of exchanging data. In\naddition, we may experience delays in processing claims and therefore earning our fees if the third parties with whom we work are not in full compliance with these new standards in the required timeframe. Claims processing systems failures, incapacities or deficiencies internal to these third-parties could significantly delay or obstruct our ability to recover money for our customers, and thereby interfere with our performance under our contracts and our ability to generate revenue from those contracts in the timeframe we anticipate, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be precluded from bidding on and/or performing certain work due to other work we currently perform.\nVarious laws, regulations and administrative policies prohibit companies from performing work for government agencies in capacities that might be viewed to create an actual or perceived conflict of interest. In particular, CMS has stringent conflict of interest rules, which can limit our bidding for specific work for CMS, or for other contracts that might conflict, or be perceived by CMS to conflict, with contractual work for CMS. State governments and managed care organizations also have conflict of interest restrictions that could limit our ability to bid for certain work. Conflict of interest rules and standards change frequently, and are subject to varying interpretations and varying degrees and consistency of enforcement at the federal, state and municipal levels, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in navigating these restrictions.\nThe expansion and diversification of our business operations increases the potential that customers or potential customers will perceive conflicts of interest between our various subsidiaries, products, services, activities and customer relationships. Such conflicts, whether real or perceived, could result in loss of contracts or require us to divest ourselves of certain existing business in order to qualify for new contract awards. We may be required to adjust our current management and personnel structure, as well as our corporate organization and entity structure, in order to appropriately mitigate conflicts and otherwise accommodate the needs as a company that is expanding in size and complexity. Our failure to devote sufficient care, attention and resources to managing these adjustments may result in technical or administrative errors that could expose us to potential liability or adverse regulatory action. If we are prevented from expanding our business due to real or perceived conflicts of interest, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSystem interruptions or failures could expose us to liability and harm our business.\nOur data and operation centers are essential to our business and our operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect our information systems. We attempt to mitigate the potential adverse effects of a disruption, relocation or change in operating environment; however, we cannot provide assurance that the situations we plan for and the amount of insurance coverage that we maintain will be adequate in any particular case. In addition, despite system redundancy and security measures, our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from, among other sources:\n\u2022 power loss, transmission cable cuts and telecommunications failures;\n\u2022 damage or interruption caused by fire, earthquake and other natural disasters;\n\u2022 attacks by hackers or nefarious actors;\n\u2022 computer viruses and other malware, or software defects; and\n\u2022 physical break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control.\nIf we encounter a business interruption; if we fail to effectively maintain our information systems; if it takes longer than we anticipate to complete required upgrades, enhancements or integrations; or if our business continuity plans and business interruption insurance do not effectively compensate on a timely\nbasis, we could suffer operational disruptions, disputes with customers, civil or criminal penalties, regulatory problems, increases in administrative expenses, loss of our ability to produce timely and accurate financial and other reports or other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we do not successfully integrate the businesses that we acquire, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nHistorically, to achieve our strategic goals, we have made a significant number of acquisitions that have expanded the products and services we offer, provided a presence in complementary business lines, or expanded our geographic presence and/or customer base. Business acquisitions and combinations involve a number of risk factors that could affect our operations, including:\n\u2022 diversion of management's attention and other resources;\n\u2022 our ability to maintain relationships with the customers of the acquired business and further develop the acquired business;\n\u2022 our ability to cross-sell our services and the services of the acquired businesses to our respective customers;\n\u2022 compliance with regulatory requirements and avoiding potential conflicts of interest in markets that we serve;\n\u2022 our ability to integrate and coordinate organizations that are geographically diverse and may have different business cultures;\n\u2022 transition of operations, users and customers to our existing platforms or the integration of data, systems and technology platforms with ours;\n\u2022 our ability to retain or replace key personnel;\n\u2022 entry into unfamiliar markets;\n\u2022 assumption of unanticipated legal or financial liabilities and/or negative publicity related to prior acts by the acquired entity;\n\u2022 litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or third parties;\n\u2022 becoming significantly leveraged as a result of incurring debt to finance an acquisition;\n\u2022 unanticipated operating, accounting or management difficulties in connection with the acquired entities; and/or\n\u2022 impairment of acquired intangible assets, including goodwill, and dilution to our earnings per share.\nWe intend to continue our acquisition strategy to expand and diversify our business. We cannot, however, provide assurance that we will be able to identify any potential acquisition candidates or consummate any additional acquisitions or that any future acquisitions will be successfully integrated or will be advantageous to us. Entities we acquire may not achieve the revenue and earnings we anticipate or their liabilities may exceed our expectations. We could face integration issues pertaining to the internal controls and operational functions of the acquired companies and we also could fail to realize cost efficiencies or synergies that we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates. Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with a particular acquired entity could materially and adversely affect our reputation as a whole. We may be unable to profitably manage entities that we have acquired or that we may acquire, or we may fail to integrate them successfully without incurring substantial expenses, delays or other problems. If we fail to successfully integrate the businesses that we acquire, we may not\nrealize any of the benefits that we anticipate in connection with the acquisitions and that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and our government contracts are subject to audit and investigation rights. Any violation of the laws and regulations applicable to us or a negative audit or investigation finding could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMuch of our business is regulated by the federal government and the states in which we operate. The laws and regulations governing our operations are generally intended to benefit and protect individual citizens, including government program beneficiaries, health plan members and providers, rather than stockholders. The government agencies administering these laws and regulations have broad latitude to enforce them. These laws and regulations, along with the terms of our government contracts, regulate how we do business, what services we offer and how we interact with our customers, providers, other healthcare payers and the public. We are subject, on an ongoing basis, to various governmental reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with our contracts and applicable laws and regulations.\nIn addition, because we receive payments from federal and state governmental agencies, we are subject to various laws, including the Federal False Claims Act and similar state statutes, which permit government law enforcement agencies to institute suits against us for violations and, in some cases, to seek double or treble damages, penalties and assessments. In addition, private citizens, acting as whistleblowers, can sue on behalf of the government under the \"qui tam\" provisions of the Federal False Claims Act and similar statutory provisions in many states.\nThe expansion of our operations into new products and services may further expose us to requirements and potential liabilities under additional statutes and legislative schemes that have previously not been relevant to our business, such as banking and credit reporting statutes, that may both increase demands on our resources for compliance activities and subject us to potential penalties for noncompliance with statutory and regulatory standards. Increased involvement in analytic or audit work that can have an impact on the eligibility of individuals for medical coverage or specific benefits could increase the likelihood and incidence of our being subjected to scrutiny or legal actions by parties other than our customers, based on alleged mistakes or deficiencies in our work, with significant resulting costs and strain on our resources.\nIf the government discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may be subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions and debarment from doing business with the government. The risks to which we are subject, particularly under the Federal False Claims Act and similar state fraud statutes, have increased in recent years due to legislative changes that have (among other amendments) expanded the definition of a false claim to include, potentially, any unreimbursed overpayment received from, or other monetary debt owed to, a government agency. This subjects us to potential liability for a false claim, for example, where we may be overcharged for services by a subcontractor and may pass that charge on to a government customer, or where we may have a good faith disagreement with a government agency's view of whether an overpayment has occurred. If we are found to be in violation of any applicable law or regulation, or if we receive an adverse review, audit or investigation, any resulting negative publicity, penalties or sanctions could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry, impair our ability to compete for new contracts and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be a party to litigation, regulatory, or other dispute resolution proceedings. Adverse judgments or settlements in any of these proceedings could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject and may be a party to lawsuits and other claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. These may include lawsuits and claims related to, for example, contracts, subcontracts, teaming agreements, protection of confidential information or trade secrets, employment of our workforce or compliance with any of a wide array of state and federal statutes, rules and regulations that pertain to different aspects of our business. We may also be required to initiate expensive litigation or other proceedings to protect our business interests. In addition, because of the payments we receive from government customers, we may be subject to unexpected inquiries, investigations, legal actions or enforcement proceedings pursuant to the False Claims Act, healthcare fraud, waste and abuse laws or similar legislation. Any investigations, settlements or adverse judgments stemming from such legal disputes or other claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us, as well as reputational injury that could adversely affect us. There is a risk that we will not be successful in such litigation. In addition, litigation and other legal claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of currently pending legal matters may change in the future. Those uncertainties include, but are not limited to, costs of litigation, unpredictable judicial or jury decisions and the differing laws and judicial proclivities regarding damage awards among the states in which we operate. Unexpected outcomes in such legal proceedings, or changes in management's evaluation or predictions of the likely outcomes of such proceedings (possibly resulting in changes in established reserves), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur outstanding indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations.\nIn December 2011, we entered into a five-year, revolving and term secured credit agreement with certain financial institutions and Citibank, N.A. as Administrative Agent in connection with our acquisition of HDI. In May 2013, we amended and restated the credit agreement and entered into a $500 million five-year revolving credit agreement (\"Credit Agreement\"). Under specified circumstances, the revolving credit facility under the Credit Agreement can be increased or one or more incremental term loan facilities can be added. Our obligations and any amounts due under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by our material subsidiaries and secured by a security interest in all, or substantially all, of our and our subsidiaries' physical assets. As of December 31, 2014, the outstanding principal balance due on the revolving credit facility was $197.8 million.\nOur outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have important consequences for us, including, without limitation, that: we may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness; our indebtedness and leverage may increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions, as well as to competitive pressures; our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and for general corporate and other purposes may be limited; and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry may be limited.\nIn addition, our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our outstanding revolving credit facility depends upon our future performance and our ability to generate cash flows. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we are required to comply with specified financial and operating covenants, which may limit our ability to operate our business as we otherwise might operate it. For example, our obligations may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default, which includes customary events of default including, without limitation, payment defaults, failure to perform affirmative covenants, failure to refrain from actions or omissions prohibited by negative covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, cross-defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, defaults due to certain ERISA related events and a change of control default. If not cured, an event of default would result in any amounts outstanding, including any accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming\nimmediately due and payable, which would require us to, among other things: seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets, refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, sell selected assets, and/or reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, and any such financing or refinancing might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations or are forced to take additional measures to be able to service our indebtedness, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe obtain a significant portion of our business through competitive bidding in response to government requests for proposals and future contracts may not be awarded through this process on the same level and we may not re-procure certain contracts.\nIn order to market our services to customers, we are often required to respond to government-issued requests for proposals (\"RFPs\") to compete for a contract. This requires that we accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract, the time required to establish operations and the likely terms of any proposals submitted by our competitors. We must also assemble and submit a large volume of information within a RFP's rigid timetable, and our ability to provide timely and complete responses to RFPs will greatly impact our business. Should any part of our business suffer a negative event, for example, a customer dispute or a government inquiry, we may be required to disclose the occurrence of that event in a RFP, which could impact our ability to win the contract at issue. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to obtain contracts in response to government RFPs, that we will be successful in re-winning contracts after they expire, or that our proposals will result in profitable contracts. In addition, if we are unable to win particular contracts, we may be precluded from entering certain customer markets for a number of years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period, our business and prospects will be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to accurately estimate the factors upon which we base our contract pricing, we may generate less profit than expected or incur losses on those contracts.\nOur pricing is dependent on our internal forecasts and predictions about our projects and the marketplace, which might be based on limited data and could turn out to be inaccurate. A majority of our contracts are contingency fee based. For contingency fee based offerings, we receive our fee based on recoveries received by our customers. Our ability to earn a profit on a contingency fee offering requires that we accurately estimate costs involved and outcomes likely to be achieved and assess the probability of completing multiple tasks and transactions within the contracted time period. Some of our contracts with the federal government are cost-plus or time-and-material based. Revenue on cost-plus contracts is recognized based on costs incurred plus an estimate of the negotiated fee earned. To earn a profit on these contracts, we must accurately estimate costs involved and assess the probability of achieving certain milestones within the contracted time period. If we do not accurately estimate the costs and timing for completing projects, or if we encounter increased or unexpected costs, delays, failures, liabilities or risks, including those outside of our control, our contracts could prove unprofitable for us or yield lower profit margins than anticipated. Although we believe that we have recorded adequate provisions in our financial statements for losses on our fixed-price and cost-plus contracts where applicable, as required under United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"), we cannot provide assurance that our contract loss provisions will be adequate to cover all actual future losses.\nThe U.S. government's determination to award a contract may be challenged by an interested party. As a result, even if we win a bid, the contract may be delayed or may never be implemented if such a challenge is successful.\nThe laws and regulations governing procurements of goods and services by the U.S. government provide procedures by which other bidders and other interested parties may challenge the award of a government contract. Challenges or protests to government awards may be filed even if there are no valid\nlegal grounds on which to base the protest. If any such protests are filed, the government agency may decide to withhold a contract award or suspend performance under the contract while the protest is being considered by the GAO or the applicable federal court, or may choose to take corrective action on its own, in each case, potentially delaying the start of the contract. If we are the original awardee of a protested contract, we could be forced to expend considerable funds to defend a potential award, while also incurring expenses to maintain our ability to timely start implementation in case the protest is resolved in our favor. It can take many months to resolve these protests, and even if it is resolved in our favor, the resulting delay in the start-up and funding of our work under the contracts may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from those anticipated. In the event of irregularities we perceive or learn of in the award or bidding process, we also may be forced to file protests in response to RFP awards to competitors, at significant cost to us. In addition, a contract award may be terminated or the government agency may opt to solicit new bids and award a new contract if a protest is successful or the government agency chooses not to uphold its original award. We cannot provide assurance that we will prevail if a contract we are awarded is protested or that if we protest an award we will be successful. Extended implementation delays or successful challenges of our contract awards could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe depend on many different entities to supply information and an inability to successfully manage our relationships with a number of these suppliers may harm the quality and availability of our services.\nWe obtain data used in our services from many sources, including commercial insurance plans, financial institutions, managed care organizations, government entities and non-government entities. From time to time, challenges arise in managing and maintaining our relationships with entities that are not our customers and that furnish information to us pursuant to a combination of voluntary cooperation and legal obligation under laws and regulations that are often subject to differing interpretation. Our data suppliers may determine that some uses of data for our customers are not permitted by our agreements, and seek to limit or end our access and use of certain data for particular purposes or customers. They may also make errors in compiling, transmitting or accurately characterizing data, or may have technological limitations that interfere with our receipt or use of the data we are relying upon them to provide. If a number of information sources or suppliers become unable or unwilling to provide us with certain data under terms of use that are acceptable to us and our customers, or if the applicable regulatory and law enforcement regime for use and protection of this data changes in a way that imposes unacceptable or unreasonable conditions or risks on us or disincentivizes our suppliers to continue to provide us with data, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain new agreements with alternative data suppliers on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we lose our data sources or access to certain data; are unable to identify and reach the requisite agreements with suitable alternative suppliers and integrate these data sources into our service offerings; or there is a lack of integrity of data that our suppliers provide, we could experience service disruptions, increased costs, reduced quality of our services and/or performance penalties under our customer contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may rely on subcontractors and partners to provide customers with a single-source solution or we may serve as a subcontractor to a third party prime contractor.\nFrom time to time, we may engage subcontractors, teaming partners or other third parties to provide our customers with a single-source solution for a broader range of service needs. Similarly, we are and may in the future be engaged as a subcontractor to a third party prime contractor. Subcontracting arrangements pose unique risks to us because we do not have control over the customer relationship, and our ability to generate revenue under the subcontract is dependent on the prime contractor, its performance and relationship with the customer and its relationship with us. While we believe that we perform appropriate due diligence on our prime contractors, subcontractors and teaming partners and that we take adequate measures to ensure that they comply with the appropriate laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that\nthose parties will comply with the terms set forth in their agreements with us (or in the case of a prime contractor, their agreement with the customer), or that they will be reasonable in construing their contractual rights and obligations, always act appropriately in dealing with us or customers, provide adequate service, or remain in compliance with the relevant laws, rules or regulations. We may have disputes with our prime contractors, subcontractors, teaming partners or other third parties arising from the quality and timeliness of work being performed, customer concerns, contractual interpretations or other matters. Performance deficiencies or misconduct by our prime contractors or subcontractors or perceived performance deficiencies by us could result in a contract termination and/or could adversely affect our customer relationships and reputation. We may be exposed to liability if we lose or terminate a subcontractor or teaming partner due to a dispute, and subsequently have difficulty engaging an appropriate replacement or otherwise performing their functions in-house, such that we fail to fulfill our contractual obligations to our customer. In the event a prime contract, under which we serve as a subcontractor, is terminated, whether for non-performance by the prime contractor or otherwise, then our subcontract will similarly terminate and we could face contractual liability and the resulting contract loss could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe use software vendors, utility providers and network providers in our business and could be materially adversely affected if they cannot deliver or perform as expected or if our relationships with them are terminated or otherwise change.\nOur ability to service our customers and deliver and implement solutions requires that we work with certain third party providers, including software vendors, utility and network providers and depends on such third parties meeting our expectations in both timeliness and quality. Our business could be materially and adversely affected and we might incur significant additional liabilities if the services provided by these third party providers do not meet our expectations, or if they terminate or refuse to renew their relationships with us, or if they were to offer their products to us in the future on less advantageous terms. In addition, while there are backup systems in many of our operating facilities, an extended outage of utility or network services supplied by these vendors or providers may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights the value of our products and services may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur success as a company depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. Our expanding operations and efforts to develop new products and services also make protection of our intellectual property more critical. The steps we have taken to deter misappropriation of intellectual property may be insufficient to protect our proprietary information. From time to time, competitors have attempted to use state open records and/or federal Freedom of Information Act laws to obtain our proposal responses. We cannot be certain that our efforts to protect these confidential and proprietary elements will always be successful, due to the many factors that go into the various state and federal decisions to release information (even in spite of our objections and responses). In addition, misappropriation of our intellectual property by third parties, or any disclosure or dissemination of our business intelligence, queries, algorithms and other similar information by any means, could undermine any competitive advantage we currently derive or may derive. On the other hand, third parties may claim that we are infringing upon or misappropriating their intellectual property. Our exposure to risks related to the use of intellectual property may also increase as a result of acquisitions since third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology. Any of these situations could result in our expending significant time and incurring expense to defend ourselves or to enforce our intellectual property rights and could result in our being prevented from furnishing certain products and services. Although we have taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, we cannot provide assurance that others will not compete with our business by offering products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent\nunauthorized use or appropriation by third parties or our employees, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur systems and networks may be subject to cyber security breaches and other disruptions that could compromise our information and harm our business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we rely heavily upon our technology systems and networks to input, maintain and communicate the confidential and proprietary data we receive on behalf of our customers. The secure processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Our security measures could be compromised and, as a result, our data, customers' data, information technology or infrastructure could be accessed improperly, made unavailable, improperly modified, corrupted by computer hackers, computer viruses or other malicious software programs that could attack our services or breached due to employee error or malfeasance, all of which could create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service. This is also true for third-party products or services that we use. In addition, subcontractors, teaming partners or other third party vendors that receive or utilize confidential information on our behalf may become subject to a security breach, which may result in unauthorized access to such third-party's information systems and/or our customers' protected information. The occurrence of any of these events could cause our services to be perceived as vulnerable, cause our customers to lose confidence in our services, negatively affect our ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to terminate or not renew our services and damage our reputation, all of which could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses and expose us to legal claims and regulatory actions. Similarly, if our internal networks are compromised, we could be adversely affected by the loss of proprietary, trade secret or confidential technical and financial data. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. We could be forced to expend significant resources in response to a cyber-security breach, including repairing system damage, increasing cyber security protection costs by deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, paying regulatory fines and litigating and resolving legal claims and regulatory actions, all of which could increase our expenses, divert the attention of our management and key personnel away from our business operations and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe federal government or a state may limit or prohibit the outsourcing of certain programs or functions, or may refuse to grant consents and/or waivers necessary to permit private entities, such as us, to perform certain elements of government programs or functions, or there may be other state or federal limitations on our outsourcing of work or our vendor use that obstruct cost-effective performance of our contracts.\nThe federal government or a state could limit or prohibit private contractors like us from operating or performing elements of certain government functions or programs. State or local governments could be required to operate such programs with government employees as a condition of receiving federal funding. Moreover, under current law, in order to privatize certain functions of government programs, the federal government must grant a consent and/or waiver to the petitioning state or local agency. If the federal government does not grant a necessary consent or waiver, the state or local agency will be unable to outsource that function to a private entity. Such a situation could eliminate a contracting opportunity or reduce the value of an existing contract.\nSimilarly, other state or federal limitations on outsourcing certain types of work to vendors that supplement our own workforce could make it more difficult for us to fulfill our contracts in a cost-effective manner. Certain segments of our operations use or involve vendor or subcontractor personnel located outside of the United States, who may (under carefully controlled circumstances) access certain PHI in the\ncourse of assisting us with various elements of the services we provide to our customers. There is, however, increasing pressure from an expanding number of sources to prohibit the use of off-shore labor, particularly on government contracts. The federal government and a number of states have considered laws and/or issued rules and orders that would limit, restrict or wholly prohibit the use of off-shore labor in performance of government contracts, or impose sanctions for the use of such resources. Some of our customers have already chosen to contractually limit or restrict our ability to use off-shore resources. Intensified restrictions of this type or associated penalties could raise our costs of doing business, expose us to unexpected fines or penalties, increase the prices we must charge to customers to realize a profit and eliminate or significantly reduce the value of existing contracts or potential contract opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates.\nWe are a United States-based company subject to various federal, state and local tax laws and regulations in multiple U.S. jurisdictions that govern numerous aspects of our business.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax rates could affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned and taxed, by changes in, or our interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes including impairments of goodwill, by changes in U.S. GAAP or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nIn addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and other domestic tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments that may result. There can be no assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to realize the entire book value of goodwill and other intangible assets from acquisitions.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we have $361.5 million of goodwill and $74.6 million of net intangible assets. We assess goodwill and other intangible assets at least annually for impairment in the second quarter of each year, or more frequently if certain events or circumstances warrant. In the event that the book value of goodwill is impaired, any such impairment would be charged to earnings in the period of impairment. We cannot provide assurance that future impairment of goodwill will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur success may depend on the continued service and availability of key personnel and we may be unable to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel to properly operate our business.\nOur success and future growth is dependent upon the ability of our executive officers and our senior managers to generate business and execute on our business plans successfully. We have experienced executive turnover in the past year and have hired and promoted a number of new executive officers. We may face challenges in effectively managing our operations as they learn about our company and business and develop working relationships with our other executive officers and their staff. Our ability to execute on our business plans will be impacted if our management team cannot work together effectively, or if other members of our senior management team resign.\nIn addition, our success requires that we attract, develop, motivate and retain experienced and innovative executive officers, senior managers who have successfully managed or designed government services programs or who have relevant experience in other sectors of the data management or healthcare\nindustry and information technology professionals who have designed or implemented complex information technology projects. Innovative, experienced and technologically proficient individuals are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the most capable and desirable executive officers and senior managers. We may incur increased expenses in connection with the hiring, promotion or replacement of any of these key individuals. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or the loss of significant numbers of senior managers or information technology professionals could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to execute on contracts is dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees.\nOur delivery of services is labor-intensive. When we are awarded a contract, we must quickly hire project leaders, case management staff and other personnel with the specific qualifications required by our contracts. The additional staff also creates a concurrent demand for increased administrative personnel. Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability is limited by our ability to recruit, employ, train and retain the skilled personnel necessary to fulfill our contractual requirements. The success of recruitment and retention strategy depends on a number of factors, including the competitive demands for employees having the skills we need and the level of compensation required to hire and retain such employees. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to recruit the appropriate personnel in the timeframe required to fulfill our contractual obligations, we will be successful in maintaining the personnel necessary to efficiently operate and support our business, or if our recruitment and retention strategies are successful, our labor costs will not increase significantly. Our inability to hire sufficient personnel on a timely basis and without significantly increasing our labor costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur health insurance coverage and self-insurance reserves may not cover future claims.\nWe maintain various insurance policies for employee health, workers' compensation, general liability and property damage. We are self-insured for our health plans, and have purchased a fully-insured stop loss policy to help offset our liability for both individual and aggregate claim costs. We are also responsible for losses up to a certain limit for workers' compensation, general liability and property damage insurance.\nFor policies under which we are responsible for losses, we record a liability that represents our estimated cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date. Our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors, including historical trends, actuarial assumptions and economic conditions, and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances. Our significant growth rate could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected, our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and we may be required to record additional expense. Unanticipated changes may also produce materially different amounts of expense than reported under these programs, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely and may continue to do so. During the 52-week period ended February 20, 2015, the closing price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select market ranged from a high of $23.23 per share, to a low of $15.74 per share. We expect our stock price to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors, including factors beyond our control. Some of these factors are:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;\n\u2022 the gain or loss of significant contracts or the changes in the contingency fee rates or other significant terms of our business arrangements with our significant customers;\n\u2022 delays in our development and introduction of new services;\n\u2022 changes in government policies or regulations;\n\u2022 delays by government agencies of the awarding of contracts, including the impact of any protests or lawsuits filed in connection with the award of any such contracts;\n\u2022 developments in our relationships with current or future customers and suppliers;\n\u2022 operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to our company;\n\u2022 news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the healthcare industry;\n\u2022 perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022 acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022 political developments affecting healthcare at the federal, state or local level;\n\u2022 our failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\u2022 the hiring or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022 the introduction of new services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022 future sales of shares of common stock in the public market;\n\u2022 any other changes in the amount of our outstanding shares, including as a result of share repurchases;\n\u2022 securities class action or other litigation; and\n\u2022 market conditions in the industry and the economy as a whole.\nIn addition, the stock market often experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. When the market price of a company's stock drops significantly, stockholders may institute securities class action litigation against that company. Any litigation against us could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert the time and attention of our management and other resources or otherwise harm our business.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation could discourage unsolicited takeover attempts, which could depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of \"blank check\" preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined by our Board of Directors. Accordingly, our Board of Directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights, that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of holders of our common stock. In the event of issuance, preferred stock could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a change in control. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock, we cannot provide assurance that we will not do so in the future. In addition, our bylaws provide for a classified Board of Directors, which could also have the effect of discouraging a change of control.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends, you will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe have paid no cash dividends on any of our capital stock to date and currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The success of your investment in our common stock will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased your shares.\nFailure to maintain adequate internal controls may affect our ability to timely or accurately report our financial results.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. If we identify and are unable to remediate material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the SEC and NASDAQ, we could face severe consequences from those authorities. Either case may result in a material adverse effect on our business. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.", "PERMNO": 78156, "SIC": 6411, "TIC": "HMSY"}
