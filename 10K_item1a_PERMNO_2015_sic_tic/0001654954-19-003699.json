You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the financial statements and the related notes, before you decide whether to invest in our common stock. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed by any of the following risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe company lacks operations and has losses which are expected to continue into the future.\nAs a result of the sale of substantially all of the Company\u2019s operating assets, the Company has no operations from which to derive revenue. The Company\u2019s operating history is not a useful measure upon which an evaluation of its future success or failure can be made. The Company\u2019s ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon its ability to generate revenues, and the ability to raise the capital necessary to acquire an operating entity or engage in a merger or other transaction with an operating entity.\nThe Company is a \u201cshell\u201d corporation as that is defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). Based upon current plans, the Company expects to incur operating losses in future periods. The Company cannot guarantee that it will be successful in generating revenues in the future.\nIf the company does not successfully consummate a business combination, the company will require additional funds.\nFor the Company to once again engage in operations, it will either need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or sale of equity, or it will need to acquire or enter into a merger transaction with an operating entity. The Company is currently seeking to engage in such a merger with an operating entity, but there is no guarantee that this merger will reach a successful completion. If the merger fails and the Company seeks additional financing, this financing may not be available when needed. Even if this financing is available, it may be on terms that the Company deems unacceptable or materially adverse to its interests with respect to dilution of book value, dividend preference, liquidation preference, or other terms.\nThe company is not an operating company and does not have any significant capital.\nBecause the Company does not have significant capital, it must limit its operations and there is little chance that operations will begin at any time soon, as a result of such limited capital, unless the Company obtains additional funding to acquire an operating entity or enters into a merger transaction with an operating entity.\nBecause ownership of more than 50% of the company\u2019s outstanding common shares are held by a few shareholders, these shareholders will be able to decide who will be our directors, and you may not be able to elect any directors.\nOver 50% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock is held by a few shareholders, who therefore control the Company. As a result, unless the Company issues more shares and/or these shareholders sell some of their shares, they will be able to elect all of the Company\u2019s directors and control its operations. If the Company does enter into an acquisition or merger transaction, the Company may issue a significant number of shares in connection with that transaction. This could result in a reduction in value to the common stock you own because of the ineffective voting power. The concentration of holdings could adversely affect the value of your shares and prevent the Company from undergoing a change of control in the future.\nThe company has not paid dividends and none are anticipated.\nTo date, the Company has paid no cash dividends on its common stock. For the foreseeable future, the Company expects that earnings generated from the Company\u2019s operations, if any, will be retained for use in its business and not to pay dividends.\n\"Penny stock\" rules may make buying or selling the company\u2019s common stock difficult.\nTrading in the Company\u2019s securities is subject to the \u201cPenny Stock\u201d Rules.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) has adopted regulations that generally define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. These rules require that any broker-dealer who recommends our securities to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors, must, prior to the sale, make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to execute the transaction. Unless an exception is available, the regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with trading in the penny stock market. In addition, broker-dealers must disclose commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities they offer. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of our securities. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to certain types of investors are required to comply with the Commission\u2019s regulations concerning the transfer of penny stock. These regulations require broker-dealers to:\n\u25cf\nMake a suitability determination prior to selling a penny stock to the purchaser;\n\u25cf\nReceive the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction; and\n\u25cf\nProvide certain written disclosures to the purchaser.\nThese requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell the Company\u2019s common stock and may affect your ability to resell our common stock.", "PERMNO": 81502, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "WVWCQ"}
