{"cik": "96793", "company": "SUNLINK HEALTH SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-09-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to other information contained in this Annual Report, including certain cautionary and forward-looking statements, you should carefully consider the following factors in evaluating an investment in SunLink:\nConsolidated Operations Risks\nIf our operations continue to generate operating losses, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our liquidity needs.\nWe rely upon cash on hand, cash from operations and cash from asset sales to fund our cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, commitments and payments of principal and interest on borrowings. Our ability to generate cash from operations has been negatively impacted by reduced Federal and state reimbursements, uncollectible self-pay net revenues of our Healthcare Services segment, increased salary\nexpenses for employed physicians and decreased patient volume at our facilities as a result of economic conditions in the locations we serve as well as decreased sales volume and earning experienced by our Pharmacy segment. We expect that these factors will continue to have a negative impact on our business for the foreseeable future. Further deterioration would negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nSunLink would require additional debt or equity capital in order to make significant capital investments or expand our operations and the inability to make significant capital investments or expand our operations may negatively affect SunLink\u2019s competitive position, reduce earnings, and negatively affect our results of operations.\nSunLink\u2019s operations strategy may require significant capital investments from time to time. Significant capital investments may be required for on-going and planned capital improvements at existing facilities and/or in connection with future capital projects either in connection with existing operations or future acquired operations. SunLink\u2019s ability to make capital investments depends on numerous factors such as the availability of funds from operations and access to additional debt and equity financing. No assurance can be given that the necessary funds will be available. Moreover, incurrence of additional debt financing, if available, may involve additional restrictive covenants that could negatively affect SunLink\u2019s ability to operate its business in the desired manner, and raising additional equity likely would be dilutive to shareholders. The failure to obtain funds necessary for the realization of SunLink\u2019s operating strategy could impair SunLink\u2019s existing operations and could force SunLink to forego opportunities that may arise in the future. This could, in turn, have a negative impact on the competitive position of our operating subsidiaries.\nIndebtedness of one of our subsidiaries which we have guaranteed could be subject to prepayment which could require a substantial amount of our cash and any such repayment could restrict our current and future operations, which could adversely affect our ability to manage our operations and liquidity.\nThe RDA loan at our Trace Hospital subsidiary contains various terms and conditions, including financial restrictions and limitations, and affirmative and negative covenants. Currently, such subsidiary is not in compliance with the debt service coverage, fixed charge ratio and funded debt to EBITDA ratios under its RDA loan. The loan is guaranteed by SunLink, and SunLink and Trace Hospital continue to discuss a modification or waiver of this non-compliance with the lender. In the event the lender were to declare an event of default and accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness, either Trace Hospital or SunLink under its guarantee could be required to repay such loan in advance of its maturity which could require a substantial amount of our cash and any such repayment could restrict our current and future operations, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to manage our operations and liquidity.\nHealthcare reform has initiated significant changes to the United States healthcare system some of which may adversely affect our business.\nVarious healthcare reform provisions became law upon enactment of the ACA. The reforms contained in the ACA have impacted each of our businesses in some manner. Several of the reforms are very significant and could ultimately change the nature of our services, the methods of payment for our services, and the underlying regulatory environment. The reforms include the possible modifications to the conditions of qualification for payment, bundling payments to cover both acute and post-acute care, and the imposition of enrollment limitations on new providers. The ACA also provides for: (1) reductions to the annual market basket payment updates for additional annual \u201cproductivity adjustment\u201d reductions to the annual market basket payment update as determined by CMS for nursing centers (beginning in federal fiscal year 2012); (2) new transparency, reporting, and certification requirements for nursing centers, including disclosures regarding organizational structure, officers, directors, trustees, managing employees, and financial, clinical, and other related data; (3) a quality reporting system for hospitals beginning in federal fiscal year 2014; and (4) reductions in Medicare payments to hospitals beginning in federal fiscal year 2014 for failure to meet certain quality reporting standards or to comply with standards in new value-based purchasing demonstration project programs.\nIn general, a primary goal of recurrent efforts at healthcare reform is to reduce the cost to federal and state government of reimbursement to providers under various governmental programs, which includes reductions in the reimbursement paid to us and other healthcare providers. Moreover, healthcare reform could negatively impact insurance companies, other third-party payors, our customers, as well as other healthcare providers, which may in turn negatively impact our business. As such, healthcare reforms and changes resulting from the ACA, as well as other similar healthcare reforms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nSunLink conducts business in a heavily regulated industry; changes in regulations or violations of regulations may result in increased costs or sanctions that could reduce revenue and profitability.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to:\n\u2022\nlicensure;\n\u2022\nconduct of operations including patient referrals, physician recruiting practices, cost reporting and billing practices;\n\u2022\nownership, condition and operation of facilities;\n\u2022\naddition of facilities and services;\n\u2022\nconfidentiality, maintenance, and security issues associated with medical records;\n\u2022\nbilling for services; and\n\u2022\nprices for services.\nThese laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many instances, the industry does not have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations, including in particular, Medicare and Medicaid anti-fraud and abuse amendments, codified in Section 1128B(b) of the Social Security Act and known as the \u201canti-kickback statute.\u201d This law prohibits providers and others from soliciting, receiving, offering or paying, directly or indirectly, any remuneration with the intent to generate referrals of orders for services or items reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs.\nHHS regulations describe some of the conduct and business relationships immune from prosecution under the anti-kickback statute. The fact that a given business arrangement does not fall within one of these \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions does not render the arrangement illegal. However, business arrangements of healthcare service providers that fail to satisfy the applicable safe harbor criteria risk increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities.\nWe have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our subsidiaries\u2019 hospitals. We have contracts with physicians providing services under a variety of financial arrangements such as employment contracts and professional service agreements. We also provide financial incentives, including loans and minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into the communities served by our subsidiaries\u2019 facilities and other operations.\nHIPAA broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws to include all healthcare services, whether or not they are reimbursed under a federal program. In addition, provisions of the Social Security Act, known as the Stark Act, also prohibit physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated health services in which the physicians or their immediate family members have an ownership interest or certain other financial arrangements.\nIn addition, SunLink\u2019s facilities will continue to remain subject to any state laws that are more restrictive than the regulations issued under HIPAA, which vary by state and could impose additional penalties. In recent years, both federal and state government agencies have announced plans for or implemented heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts.\nGovernment officials charged with responsibility for enforcing healthcare laws could assert that SunLink or any of the transactions in which the Company or its subsidiaries or their predecessors is or was involved, are in violation of these laws. It is also possible that these laws ultimately could be interpreted by the courts in a manner that is different from the interpretations made by the Company or others. A determination that either SunLink or its subsidiaries or their predecessors is or was involved in a transaction that violated these laws, or the public announcement that SunLink or its subsidiaries or their predecessors is being investigated for possible violations of these laws, could have a material adverse effect on SunLink\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects and SunLink\u2019s business reputation could suffer significantly.\nThe industry trend towards value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues.\nThere is a trend in the healthcare industry toward \u201cvalue-based\u201d purchasing of healthcare services. These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid currently require providers under such programs to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events. Many large commercial payors currently require providers under such programs to report quality data, and several commercial payors do not reimburse providers under such programs for certain preventable adverse events.\nThe ACA contains a number of provisions intended to promote value-based purchasing. Effective July 1, 2011, the ACA prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hospital acquired conditions (\u201cHACs\u201d). An HAC is a condition that is acquired by a patient while admitted as an inpatient at a hospital, such as a surgical site infection. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, hospitals that fall into the top 25% of national risk-adjusted HAC rates for all hospitals in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total Medicare payments. Hospitals with excessive readmissions for conditions designated by HHS will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard.\nThe ACA also requires HHS to implement a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services. The Affordable Care Act requires HHS to reduce inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by a percentage beginning at 1% in federal fiscal year 2013 and increasing by 0.25% each fiscal year up to 2% in federal fiscal year 2017 and subsequent years. HHS will pool the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by HHS. HHS will determine the amount each of our subsidiaries\u2019 hospital that meets or exceeds the quality performance standards will receive from the pool of dollars created by these payment reductions.\nWe expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. We are unable at this time to predict how this trend will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe lingering effects of the economic recession could adversely affect our cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.\nThe United States economy experienced a major economic recession beginning in 2008, the economy remains relatively weak in certain respects and there is a risk that the economy could lapse back into recession. Much healthcare spending is discretionary and can be significantly impacted by economic downturns. When patients are experiencing personal financial difficulties or have concerns about general economic conditions, they may choose to defer or forego elective surgeries and other non-emergent procedures, which are generally more profitable lines of business for hospitals. In addition, employers may impose or patients may select a high-\ndeductible insurance plan or no insurance at all, which increases a hospital\u2019s dependence on self-pay revenue. Moreover, a greater number of uninsured patients may seek care in our emergency rooms.\nWe are unable to quantify the specific impact of current or recent economic conditions on our business; however we believe that the economic conditions in the service areas in which our subsidiaries operate in have had an adverse impact on our operations. Such impact can be expected to continue to affect not only the healthcare decisions of our patients and potential patients but could also have an adverse impact on the solvency of certain managed care providers and other counterparties to transactions with us.\nOur subsidiaries are subject to potential claims for professional liability, including existing or potential claims based on the acts or omissions of third parties, which claims may not be covered by insurance.\nOur subsidiaries are subject to potential claims for professional liability (medical malpractice) in connection with current operations, as well as potentially acquired or discontinued operations. To cover such claims, professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance is maintained in amounts believed to be sufficient for operations, although some claims may exceed the scope or amount of the coverage in effect. However, SunLink currently purchases limited insurance policies relating to discontinued operations exposures and may purchase such additional insurance in the future. The assertion of a significant number of claims, either within a self-insured retention (deductible) or individually or in the aggregate in excess of available insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Premiums for professional liability insurance have historically been volatile and we cannot assure you that professional liability insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The operations of hospitals also depend on the professional services of physicians and other trained healthcare providers and technicians in the conduct of their respective operations, including independent laboratories and physicians rendering diagnostic and medical services. There can be no assurance that any legal action stemming from the act or omission of a third party provider of healthcare services, would not be brought against one of our subsidiaries\u2019 hospitals or SunLink, resulting in significant legal expenses in order to defend against such legal action or to obtain a financial contribution from the third-party whose acts or omissions occasioned the legal action.\nSunLink depends heavily on its management personnel and the loss of the services of one or more of SunLink\u2019s key senior management personnel could weaken SunLink\u2019s management team.\nSunLink has been, and will continue to be, dependent upon the services and management experience of its executive officers. If any of SunLink\u2019s executive officers were to resign their positions or otherwise be unable to serve, SunLink\u2019s management could be weakened.\nRisks Related to Our Healthcare Services Operations\nSunLink depends heavily on its corporate staff and subsidiaries\u2019 healthcare services management personnel and the loss of the services of one or more of SunLink\u2019s key personnel could weaken SunLink\u2019s management team and its ability to deliver healthcare services.\nThe success of our Healthcare Services operations depends on the ability of such operations to attract and retain managers and related health care employees and information technology staff as well as on the ability of hospital-based officers and key employees to manage growth successfully. SunLink\u2019s subsidiaries have not had any material difficulties in attracting healthcare facility management; however, if the subsidiaries or corporate is unable to attract and retain affective local management, the operating performance could decline.\nSunLink\u2019s success depends on the ability of our operating subsidiaries to attract and retain qualified healthcare professionals. A shortage of qualified healthcare professionals in certain markets could weaken the ability of our subsidiaries to deliver healthcare services.\nIn addition to the management personnel which each subsidiary employs, our Healthcare Services operations are dependent on the efforts, ability, and experience of other healthcare professionals, such as physicians, nurses, therapists, pharmacists and lab technicians. Nurses, pharmacists, lab technicians and other healthcare professionals are generally employees of an individual subsidiaries\u2019 hospital. Each subsidiary\u2019s success has been, and will continue to be, influenced by its ability to attract and retain these skilled employees. A shortage of healthcare professionals in certain markets, the loss of some or all of its key employees or the inability to attract or retain sufficient numbers of qualified healthcare professionals could cause the operating performance of one or more of our subsidiaries to decline.\nA significant portion of SunLink\u2019s revenue is dependent on Medicare and Medicaid payments to its subsidiaries and possible reductions in Medicare or Medicaid payments or the implementation of other measures to reduce reimbursements may reduce our revenues.\nA significant portion of SunLink\u2019s consolidated revenues are derived from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. Approximately 84% of consolidated net patient revenues were derived from the Medicare and Medicaid programs for the year ended June 30, 2017. Previous legislative changes have resulted in, and future legislative changes may result in, limitations on and reduced levels of payment and reimbursement for a substantial portion of hospital procedures and costs. Georgia and Mississippi have not expanded Medicaid or set-up exchanges.\nFuture healthcare legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of governmental healthcare programs may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nRevenue and profitability of our subsidiaries\u2019 Healthcare Services operations may be constrained by future cost containment initiatives undertaken by purchasers of such services.\nOur subsidiaries\u2019 have been affected by the increasing number of initiatives undertaken during the past several years by all major purchasers of healthcare, including (in addition to federal and state governments) insurance companies and employers, to revise payment methodologies and monitor healthcare expenditures in order to contain healthcare costs. Our community hospital operations derived approximately 16% of their consolidated net patient revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 from private payors and other non-governmental sources who contributed less than 5% of consolidated patient days. Initiatives such as managed care organizations offering prepaid and discounted medical services packages have adversely affected hospital revenue growth throughout the country and such packages represent an increasing portion of our subsidiary\u2019s hospital\u2019s admissions and outpatient revenues and have resulted in reduced revenue growth at our current and former subsidiaries\u2019 hospitals. In addition, private payers increasingly are attempting to control healthcare costs through direct contracting with hospitals to provide services on a discounted basis, increased utilization review and greater enrollment in managed care programs such as health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations, referred to as PPOs. If our subsidiaries, specifically our hospital subsidiary operations, are unable to contain costs through increased operational efficiencies and the trend toward declining reimbursements and payments continues, the results of Healthcare Services facility segment operations and cash flow will be adversely affected and the results of our consolidated operations and our consolidated cash flow similarly likely would be adversely affected.\nOur Healthcare Services operations face intense competition from other hospitals and nursing centers which directly affect such segment and consolidated revenues and profitability.\nAlthough Trace Hospital operates in a community where it is currently the only general, acute care hospital, it faces substantial competition from other hospitals, including larger tertiary care centers. Although these\ncompeting hospitals may be as far as 30 to 50 miles away, patients in these markets may migrate to these competing facilities as a result of local physician referrals, managed care plan incentives or personal choice.\nOur nursing centers also compete on a local and regional basis with other facilities providing similar services, including hospitals, extended care centers, assisted living facilities, home health agencies, and similar institutions. Some competitors may operate newer facilities and may provide services, including skilled nursing services that we do not offer at all of our nursing centers. Our competitors include government-owned, religious organization-owned, secular nonprofit and for-profit institutions. Many of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. Although there is limited, if any, price competition with respect to Medicare and Medicaid residents (since revenues received for services provided to these residents are generally based on pre-established rates), there is substantial price competition for private payment residents. Historically our nursing centers have been located adjacent to acute care hospitals owned and operated by one of our subsidiaries. Currently, however, one of our two nursing homes operate in environment where we no longer own an adjacent hospital and the former hospital has ceased operations which could subject such center to greater competition from nursing centers located closer to hospital facilities.\nThe Healthcare Services business is highly competitive and competition among hospitals, nursing homes and other healthcare providers for patients has intensified in recent years. Some of these competing facilities offer services which are not offered by SunLink\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 facilities. Some of the competing facilities are owned or operated by tax-supported governmental bodies or by private not-for-profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions which can finance capital expenditures on a tax-exempt basis and are exempt from sales, property, and income taxes. SunLink\u2019s subsidiaries also face competition from other for-profit healthcare companies, some of which have substantially greater resources, as well as other providers such as outpatient surgery and diagnostic centers and home health agencies.\nThe intense competition from other providers Healthcare Services directly affects the market share of our subsidiaries\u2019 facilities, as well as their and our revenues and profitability.\nChanges in market demographics may increase competition for certain of our Healthcare Services subsidiaries.\nThe subsidiary which owns and operates our Parkside Ellijay facility is located in an exurban area which is becoming more suburban or metropolitan. Such market is likely to attract additional competitors. We cannot assure you that we will have the financial resources to fund capital improvements to our existing facilities of this or any other subsidiary, which may face additional competition or that even if financial resources are available to us, that projected operating results will justify such expenditures. An inability to fund or the infeasibility of funding capital improvements could directly or indirectly have an adverse impact on our revenues through lower utilization, increased difficulty in the recruitment of physicians or other service providers and otherwise as a result of increased competition.\nSunLink\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 Healthcare Services may be subject to, and depend on, certificate of need laws which could affect their ability to operate profitably.\nAll states in which SunLink subsidiaries currently operate have laws requiring approval for the purchase, construction or expansion of various Healthcare Services including hospitals, nursing homes and ambulatory surgery centers and the provision of various services. Under such certificate of need (\u201cCON\u201d) laws, prior state approval is required for the acquisition of major medical equipment or the purchase, lease, construction, expansion, sale or closure of covered healthcare facilities, based on a determination of need for additional or expanded facilities or services. The failure to obtain any required CON may impair SunLink\u2019s subsidiaries\u2019 ability to operate profitably.\nIn addition, the elimination or modification of CON laws in states in which SunLink subsidiaries operate or in the future may operate covered Healthcare Services could subject such facilities to greater competition making it more difficult to operate profitably.\nThe success of SunLink\u2019s hospital subsidiary depends upon that subsidiary\u2019s hospital\u2019s ability to maintain good relationships with the physicians and, if the hospital is unable to successfully maintain good relationships with physicians, admissions and outpatient revenues may decrease and operating performance could decline.\nBecause physicians generally direct the majority of hospital admissions and outpatient services, a hospital\u2019s success is, in part, dependent upon the number and quality of physicians on the medical staffs, the admissions and referrals practices of the physicians at our subsidiaries\u2019 hospitals, and the ability to maintain good relations with physicians. Many physicians are not employees of the hospitals at which they practice and, in many of the markets, most physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals. If one or more of the hospitals operated by our subsidiaries is unable to successfully maintain good relationships with physicians, admissions may decrease and operating performance could decline.\nChanges in the laws and regulations regarding payments for hospice services and \u201croom and board\u201d provided to hospice patients residing in skilled nursing facilities could reduce our net patient service revenue and profitability.\nFor hospice patients receiving nursing center care under certain state Medicaid programs who elect hospice care under Medicare or Medicaid, the state must pay, in addition to the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% of the Medicaid per diem skilled nursing facility rate for \u201croom and board\u201d furnished to the patient by the skilled nursing facility. The reduction or elimination of Medicare payments for hospice patients residing in skilled nursing facilities could adversely affected the revenues of our skilled nursing facility.\nRisks Relating to our Pharmacy Operations\nThe operations of our Pharmacy segment may be adversely affected by changes in government reimbursement regulations and payment levels.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2017, the operations of our Pharmacy segment derived approximately 58% of its net revenues from government payors, principally Medicare and Medicaid. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 exempted rural providers of home care related services from the competitive acquisition program to which urban providers are subject.\nWe cannot assure you that the ASP reimbursement methodology will not be extended to the provision of all specialty pharmaceuticals or to the specialty pharmaceuticals most often sold by the Pharmacy segment or that the Pharmacy segment will continue to be able to operate our Pharmacy segment profitably at either existing or at lower reimbursement rates. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Part B CAP program will not be extended to rural or exurban areas in general or to the areas in which the Pharmacy segment operates, or may seek to operate, in particular or the Pharmacy segment would be able to meet the qualifications to become a Part B CAP vendor either now or at any time in the future.\nThe operations of our Pharmacy segment could be harmed by further changes in government purchasing methodologies and reimbursement rates for Medicare or Medicaid.\nIn addition to the impact of MMA, in order to deal with budget shortfalls, some states are attempting to create state administered prescription drug discount plans, to limit the number of prescriptions per person that are covered, and to raise Medicaid co-pays and deductibles, and are proposing more restrictive formularies and reductions in pharmacy reimbursement rates. Any reductions in amounts reimbursable by other government programs for pharmacy services or changes in regulations governing such reimbursements could materially and adversely affect our Pharmacy business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe durable medical equipment service line of the Pharmacy segment may be adversely affected by further changes in government reimbursement regulations and payment levels, especially if the durable medical equipment service line becomes subject to additional competitive bidding procedures.\nThe Pharmacy segment is currently subject to the expanded provisions of the Medicare competitive acquisition program. The current provisions could be expanded or changed in the future. Any additional changes in government reimbursement or payment amounts could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.\nThe operations of our Pharmacy segment depend on a continuous supply of key products. Any shortages of key products could adversely affect the business of the Pharmacy segment.\nMany of the products distributed by the operations of our Pharmacy segment are manufactured with ingredients that are susceptible to supply shortages. In addition, the manufacturers of these products may not have adequate manufacturing capability to meet rising demand. If any products distributed by the Pharmacy segment are in short supply for long periods of time, this could result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe operations of our Pharmacy segment are highly dependent on relationships with key suppliers and the loss of any of such key suppliers could adversely affect the business of the Pharmacy segment.\nAny termination of, or adverse change in, our relationships with our key suppliers, or the loss of supply of one of our key products for any other reason, could have a material adverse effect on the business of the Pharmacy segment and our consolidated results of operations. The largest supplier for the Pharmacy segment accounted for approximately 76% of the segment\u2019s cost of goods sold in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. In addition, the Pharmacy segment has few long-term contracts with its suppliers. Arrangements with most of its suppliers may be canceled by either party, without cause and on minimal notice; and many of these arrangements are not governed by written agreements.\nThe loss of one or more of larger institutional pharmacy customers could hurt our business by reducing the revenues and profitability of the operations of our Pharmacy segment.\nAs is customary in the institutional pharmacy industry, the institutional pharmacy service line of our Pharmacy segment generally does not have long-term contracts with its institutional pharmacy customers. Significant declines in the level of purchases by one or more of the larger institutional pharmacy customers could have a material adverse effect on the business of the Pharmacy segment and our consolidated results of operations.\nThe failure of the Pharmacy segment to maintain eligibility as a Medicare and Medicaid supplier could materially adversely affect its competitive position. Likewise, its failure to maintain and expand relationships with private payors, who can effectively determine the pharmacy source for their members, could materially adversely affect its competitive position.\nChanges in average wholesale prices could reduce our pricing and margins.\nMany government payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, have paid, or continue to pay, the operations of our Pharmacy segment directly or indirectly at a rate based upon a drug\u2019s AWP less a percentage factor. The Pharmacy segment also has contracted with some private payors to sell drugs at AWP or at AWP less a percentage factor. For most drugs, AWP is compiled and published by several private companies, including First DataBank, Inc. Several states have filed lawsuits against pharmaceutical manufacturers for allegedly inflating reported AWP for prescription drugs. In addition, class action lawsuits have been brought by consumers against pharmaceutical manufacturers alleging overstatement of AWP. We are not responsible for such calculations,\nreports or payments; however, there can be no assurance that the ability of our Pharmacy segment to negotiate discounts from drug manufacturers will not be materially adversely affected by such investigations or lawsuits.\nThe federal government also has entered into settlement agreements with several drug manufacturers relating to the calculation and reporting of AWP pursuant to which the drug manufacturers, among other things, have agreed to report new pricing information, the \u201caverage sales price\u201d, to government healthcare programs. The average sales price is calculated differently than AWP.\nThe Pharmacy segment faces numerous competitors and potential competitors in the market in which our Pharmacy segment operates, many of whom are significantly larger and who have significantly greater financial resources.\nLarge national companies operate in the existing market in which our Pharmacy segment operates. We cannot assure you that one or more of such companies or other healthcare companies will not seek to compete or intensify their level of competition in the areas in which we conduct or may seek to conduct one or more of the components of the operations of our Pharmacy segment.\nThe operations of our Pharmacy segment may be adversely affected by industry trends in managed care contracting and consolidation.\nA growing number of health plans are contracting with a single provider of Pharmacy services. Likewise, manufacturers may not be eager to contract with regional providers of Pharmacy services. If the Pharmacy segment is unable to obtain managed care contracts in the areas in which we provide Pharmacy services or are unable to obtain Pharmacy products at reasonable costs or at all, the business operations of our Pharmacy segment could be adversely affected.\nThe Pharmacy segment market may grow slower than expected, which could adversely affect our revenues.\nWe cannot predict the rate of actual future growth in product availability and spending, the extent to which patient demand or spending for specialty drug services in rural or exurban areas will match national averages or whether government payors will provide reimbursement for new products under Medicare or Medicaid on a timely basis, at what rates or at all. Adverse developments in any of these areas could have an adverse impact on the business operations of our Pharmacy segment.\nThe profitability of our Pharmacy segment can be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs.\nSales and profit margins of the Pharmacy segment are materially affected by the introduction of new brand name and generic drugs. New brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales revenues, while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically result in relatively lower sales revenues, but higher gross profit margins. Accordingly, a decrease in the number of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOther Risks\nFuture developments could affect our ability to maintain adequate liquidity. Additionally, our ability to access alternative sources of capital is limited.\nHistorically our available capital has been sufficient to meet our operating expenses, lease obligations, debt service requirements, and capital expenditures and we have managed our liquidity such that our aggregate unrestricted cash at June 30, 2017, was $10,494. Future circumstances could require us to materially increase our revenues, materially reduce our expenses, or otherwise materially improve operating results, dispose of existing assets or obtain material new sources of capital in order to maintain adequate liquidity.\nThe Company is currently limited in its ability to raise capital, debt or equity, in the public or private markets on what it considers acceptable terms. Trace Hospital has been able to borrow money through facility based mortgages, each of which is guaranteed by the Company, utilizing USDA Rural Development Authority guaranties, (\u201cRDA Loan\u201d). The Company and its subsidiaries currently must fund working capital needs from cash from operations or from the sale of additional assets, and we cannot assure you that we would be successful in improving our results of operations, reducing our costs, obtaining additional credit facilities or selling additional assets.\nIf we were to go private, holders of our securities would be subject to the risks of an investment in a private rather than a public company.\nFrom time to time the Company has considered the advisability of deregistering it common shares under the Exchange Act. In the event the Company were able to deregister its common shares under the Exchange Act, holders of our securities would be subject to the risks of an investment in a private rather than a public company. Upon any such deregistration of our shares, our duty to file periodic reports with the SEC would be suspended for as long as we had fewer than 300 record shareholders, and we would no longer be a public reporting company. In addition, we would be relieved of the obligation to comply with the requirements of the proxy rules under Section 14 of the Exchange Act. When and if the Company were to deregister, SunLink shares would no longer be listed on the NYSE American, LLC stock exchange, and there might not be a sufficient number of shares outstanding and publicly traded following any deregistration to ensure a continued trading market in the shares in any over-the-counter market. The continued quotation of our common shares as well as the availability of any over-the-counter trading in our common shares would depend, in part, on the nature and extent of continued publicly available information about SunLink. Shareholders also could be adversely affected by a reduction in our \u201cpublic float,\u201d that is, the number of shares owned by outside shareholders and available for trading in the securities markets, especially if the Company makes future tender offers or private or open market purchases of its common shares. The suspension of our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act might further reduce the existing limited trading market for the Company\u2019s shares and may result in a decline in the price of the Company\u2019s shares and reduced liquidity in any trading market for our shares in the future. We might also have less access to capital markets and not be able to use the Company\u2019s shares to effect acquisitions as a non-reporting company. Although the Company is not currently pursuing an effort to deregister our common shares under the Exchange Act, there is no assurance that our Board may not again determine to pursue going private in the future.\nForward-looking statements in this annual report may prove inaccurate.\nThis document contains forward-looking statements about SunLink that are not historical facts but, rather, are statements about future expectations. Forward-looking statements in this document are based on management\u2019s current views and assumptions and may be influenced by factors that could cause actual results, performance or events to be materially different from those projected. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Important factors, some of which are beyond the control of SunLink, could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.
