Risk Factors\nThe ownership of our securities involves a number of risks and uncertainties. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this 2019 Annual Report before deciding whether to invest in our Company. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us or our operating businesses. Additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Business\nOperations, Markets and Competition\nWe may be unable to compete successfully in the competitive markets in which we operate and, as a result, we may experience pricing pressure, fewer customer orders, reduced margins and the loss of market share.\nWe may be unable to compete successfully in the competitive markets in which we operate. In these markets, we encounter competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater resources, greater brand recognition, and a larger base of customers than we do. As a result, we may lose business if we are unable to devote greater resources to the research and development, manufacturing, formulation, promotion, sale or support of our products, withstand adverse changes in economic conditions or prices of raw materials, and/or maintain competitive pricing. In addition, our competitors could enter into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers which could limit our ability to acquire necessary raw materials or to generate sales and/or significantly increase costs.\nIn order to compete successfully, we must develop new products and services that offer distinct value to our customers as the markets in which we operate are driven by consumer preferences that are rapidly changing, as well as frequent new product introductions and improvements. We seek to provide tailored products for our customers\u2019 often unique problems, which require an ongoing level of innovation. Our inability to anticipate customers\u2019 changing needs or adapt to emerging technological and business trends accurately, control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could adversely affect our ability to sustain our market positions and/or penetrate new markets. Furthermore, some customers may perceive our environmental, social and governance profile to be less robust than that of our competitors, which could influence the selection of their supplier and lead to the loss of market share to our competitors.\nConsolidation of our competitors could also place us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our profitability. We operate in industries which are fragmented on a global scale, but in which there has been a trend toward consolidation in recent years. Consolidations of our competitors may jeopardize the strength of our positions in one or more of our markets which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as our growth potential.\nIf we don't successfully execute our go-to-market strategy, our business and financial performance may suffer.\nOur go-to-market strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of products and services as well as introducing new products and services to meet the demands of a continually changing technological landscape. To successfully execute this strategy, we must emphasize the aspects of our core business where demand remains strong, identify and capitalize on organic growth, and innovate and develop new products and services that will enable us to expand beyond our existing technology categories. Any failure to successfully execute this strategy, including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe process of developing new high-technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain. After we develop a product, we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins. To accomplish this, we must accurately forecast volumes, mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements, and we may not succeed at doing so. Any delay in the development, production or marketing of a new product, service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market, which could further harm our competitive position.\nIndustry and consumer trends may cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe specialty chemical industry is subject to constant and rapid technological change, product obsolescence, price erosion, evolving standards, finite product lifecycles, raw material price fluctuations, and changes in product supply and demand. For example, the mobile device market, particularly smartphones and tablets, is characterized by rapidly changing market conditions, frequent product introductions and intense competition based on features and price which could impact our sale volumes and margins. In the automotive industry, demand for our products and services may be affected by technological advances, changing automotive OEM specifications and other factors that impact production levels of our customers that we cannot control, such as interest rates, fuel prices, shifts in vehicle mix (including shifts toward alternative energy vehicles), consumer confidence, regulatory and legislative oversight requirements and trade agreements. In addition, technological changes, in our customers\u2019 products or processes may make our specialty chemicals unnecessary or obsolete. Customers also have found, and may continue to find, alternative materials or processes which no longer require our products. Finally, the specialty chemical industry is currently being affected by globalization and a shift in customers\u2019 businesses. All these factors, consumer trends and industry characteristics may impact the demand for our products which may cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations and adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe failure to attract and retain key personnel, including our executive officers, or effectively manage succession, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business involves complex operations, and therefore the Company's success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of its executive management and other key personnel and their ability to provide the Company with uninterrupted leadership and direction. In addition, because of the specialized and technical nature of our business, our future performance is dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain skilled employees, including our specialized research and development and sales and service personnel, in order to maintain our efficient production processes, drive innovation in our product offerings and maintain our deep customer relationships. The failure to attract and retain key personnel, or effectively manage succession, could have an adverse material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we are highly dependent on the experience and track records of Martin E. Franklin, the other Board members and our executive leadership team. If one or more of our executive officers or Board members were to cease to be employed by us or to serve as directors, or if we were unable to replace them in a timely manner, our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price could be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in the supply and prices of raw materials may negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe unavailability or increased prices of raw materials could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We use a variety of specialty and commodity chemicals in our formulation processes, and such formulation operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials on a timely basis. We typically purchase our major raw materials on a contract or as needed basis from outside sources. The availability and prices of raw materials may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, the financial stability of our suppliers, new laws or regulations, protectionist nationalistic trade policies and practices, changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels. In some cases, we are limited in our ability to purchase certain raw materials from other suppliers by our supply agreements which contain certain minimum purchase requirements.\nIn addition, the requirement of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, relating to the annual disclosure of a company's use of conflict minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold) mined from covered countries (Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries) in its products, could affect the sourcing, pricing, and availability of these conflict minerals. If only a limited pool of our suppliers can demonstrate that they do not source any conflict minerals from the covered countries or as permitted under the conflict minerals rules, we may not be able to obtain conformant conflict minerals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.\nFurther, commodities and energy prices are subject to volatility caused by market fluctuations, supply and demand, currency fluctuations, production and transportation disruptions, and other world events. As we source many of our raw materials globally to help ensure quality control, if the cost of energy, shipping or transportation increases and we are unable to pass along those costs to our customers, our profit margins and working capital would be adversely impacted. Also, increasing our prices to our customers could result in long-term sales declines or loss of market share if our customers find alternative suppliers or choose to reformulate their consumer products to use fewer ingredients which could have an adverse long-term impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur reliance on certain key customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers could adversely affect our overall sales and profitability.\nAlthough we believe our business is not materially dependent upon any single customer, we rely on certain key customers, the loss of which may impair our results of operations for the affected earnings periods. In addition, there is limited available manufacturing capacity that meets our quality standards and regulatory requirements. If we are unable to arrange for sufficient production capacity among our contract manufacturers or suppliers, or if our contract manufacturers or suppliers encounter production, quality, financial or other difficulties (including labor or geopolitical disturbances), we may be unable to meet our customers' demands. Finally, we rely on independent distributors to distribute our products and to assist us with the marketing and sale of certain of our products. There can be no assurance that our distributors will focus adequate resources on selling our products to end users, or will be successful in selling our products, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or divestitures which may adversely affect our existing businesses, reputation and financial condition.\nWe have in the past completed several acquisitions and dispositions and may in the future pursue additional opportunistic strategic transactions. Our ability to benefit from acquisitions or divestitures depends on many factors, including our ability to negotiate favorable transaction terms, close such transactions in a timely and cost-effective manner and successfully integrate any businesses we acquire.\nWith respect to acquisitions, we may be exposed to successor liability relating to actions taken before the acquisition. The due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition, the controls and policies we implement and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies or assets may not be sufficient to protect us from, or compensate us for, actual liabilities. Acquisitions also involve other risks, such as differing levels of management and internal control effectiveness, systems integration risks, the risk of impairment charges relating to recorded goodwill and intangible assets, the risk of significant accounting charges and expenses resulting from the completion and integration of a sizable acquisition, the need to fund increased capital expenditures and working capital requirements, our ability to retain and motivate employees and compliance and reputational risks.\nIn addition to unanticipated delays, costs and other issues, divestitures may expose us to liabilities or claims for indemnification for retained liabilities or indemnification obligations associated with the assets or businesses that we sell. The magnitude of any such retained liability or indemnification obligation may be difficult to quantify at the time of the transaction, including certain liabilities retained in connection with the Arysta Sale and described under Note 5. Discontinued Operations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2019 Annual Report. We cannot predict the ultimate resolution of these matters, and there can be no assurance that any such resolution, which may take several years, will not adversely impact our financial position or results of operations.\nIntellectual Property and Information Security\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nProtection of our proprietary processes, methods, formulations and other technology is important to our business. We generally rely on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws of the U.S. and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. The laws of other countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Failure to protect our existing intellectual property rights, domestically or internationally, may result in the loss of valuable technologies and our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of one or more competitive advances and decreased sales and/or market shares. Additionally, we rely in some cases upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise, continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. While we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third-parties to protect our intellectual property, our confidentiality agreements could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for or adequate remedies to protect our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of information.\nFurther, protecting against the unauthorized use of our products, technology and other proprietary rights is difficult, time-consuming and expensive, and we cannot be certain that the steps that we are taking will prevent or minimize the risks of such unauthorized use. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope\nof the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could also result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could significantly harm our results of operations and reputation.\nAdditionally, we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies. If we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others, we may be liable for material damages and we may be required to change our processes, redesign our products partially or completely, pay to use the technology of others, stop using certain technologies or stop producing the infringing product entirely. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, divert the time and attention of our management and technical personnel, and result in costly litigation. Any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could also prevent us from offering certain of our products and/or require us to obtain a license to continue to use the intellectual property rights that are the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of such intellectual property rights. Any required licensing fees may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nFinally, our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may increase as a result of acquisitions, as we would have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology and the steps taken to safeguard against the risks of infringing the rights of third parties.\nIf we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems, including security breaches, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on information technology systems throughout the Company to, among other functions, control our manufacturing processes, process orders and bill, collect and make payments, interact with customers and suppliers, manage inventory and otherwise conduct business. We also depend on these systems to respond to customer inquiries, contribute to our overall internal control processes, maintain records of our property, plant and equipment and record and pay amounts due to vendors and other creditors. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers. As we upgrade or change systems, we may also experience interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality and other unforeseen material issues which could adversely impact our ability to provide quotes, take customer orders and otherwise run our business in a timely manner. In addition, if our new systems fail to provide accurate and increased visibility into pricing and cost structures, it may be difficult to improve or maximize our profit margins. As a result, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, cyber-attacks or security breaches could compromise confidential, business critical information, cause a disruption in our operations or harm our reputation. Our information technology systems are subject to potential disruptions, including significant network or power outages, cyberattacks, computer viruses, other malicious codes, and/or unauthorized access attempts, any of which, if successful, could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Despite our efforts to protect sensitive information and comply with and implement data security measures, there can be no assurance that any controls and procedures that we have in place will be sufficient to protect us. Further, as cyber threats are continually evolving, our controls and procedures may become inadequate and we may be required to devote additional resources to modify or enhance our systems in the future. We may also be required to expend resources to remediate cyber-related incidents or to enhance and strengthen our cyber security. Any such disruptions to our information technology systems, breaches or compromises of data, and/or misappropriation of information could result in violation of privacy and other laws, litigation, fines, negative publicity, lost sales or business delays, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in data privacy and data protection laws and regulations, or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely impact our business.\nOur global business is subject to a wide variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect the privacy of clients, customers, employees and other third parties. The interpretation and application of such privacy laws and regulations, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the E.U. and the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) in the U.S., which became effective on January 1, 2020, is uncertain and evolving and it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. Complying with these various laws and regulations is difficult and could require us to incur substantial costs or change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nFurther, although we have implemented internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the GDPR, the CCPA and other privacy-related laws, rules and regulations, there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures enable us to be fully compliant. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with the GDPR, the CCPA or any other applicable\nregulatory requirements or orders, including but not limited to privacy, data protection, information security, or consumer protection-related privacy laws and regulations, in one or more jurisdictions within the E.U., the U.S. or elsewhere, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or individuals; subject us to significant fines, penalties, and/or judgments; require us to change our business practices; limit access to our products and services in certain countries; or otherwise adversely affect our business, as we would be at risk to lose both customers and sales, and incur substantial costs.\nFinally, as data security events and concerns about privacy abuses by other companies are changing consumer and social expectations for enhanced privacy and data protection, even the perception of noncompliance, whether or not valid, may damage our reputation.\nGlobal Operations and Regulations\nOur substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries which could affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur products are manufactured and formulated, distributed or sold globally, and approximately 76% of our net sales were generated from non-U.S. operations in 2019. The risks inherent in international trade may reduce our international sales and harm our business, including:\n\u2022fluctuations in currency values and foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022changes in tariff regulations;\n\u2022political instability, war, terrorism and other political risks;\n\u2022additional withholding taxes or other taxes on foreign income;\n\u2022foreign exchange controls or other currency restrictions and limitation on the movement of funds, potentially leading to the inability to readily repatriate earnings from foreign operations effectively;\n\u2022establishing and maintaining relationships with local distributors and OEMs;\n\u2022the effects of tariff increases and retaliations, restrictive regulations and potential boycotts;\n\u2022instability in certain countries and negative impact on the global economy;\n\u2022import and export control and licensing requirements;\n\u2022public health crisis, including the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, such as the coronavirus whose impact on our business and operations is at this time uncertain and which, if it persists for an extended period of time, could disrupt our global supply chain and result in significant expenses and delays outside of our control;\n\u2022business cultures accepting of various levels of corruption;\n\u2022compliance with a variety of U.S. laws, including the FCPA and the Bribery Act, the anti-bribery laws of other countries and rules regarding conflict minerals by us, our employees, suppliers or distributors;\n\u2022compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including unexpected changes in taxation and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022greater difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property than in the U.S.;\n\u2022difficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations; and\n\u2022challenges in maintaining an effective internal control environment, including language and cultural differences, varying levels of GAAP expertise and internal control over financial reporting.\nAny of these risks could impact our ability to manufacture, source, sell or export our products or repatriate profits. We could also experience a loss of sales and profitability from our international operations, and/or a substantial impairment or loss of assets, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, changes in U.S. policy regarding international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade agreements, could negatively impact our business. The U.S. has imposed tariffs on certain goods imported from China and certain other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs. Despite the \"Phase 1\" trade agreement signed on January 15, 2020 between the U.S. and China, it remains unclear what the U.S. and China will or will not do with respect to tariffs or other trade agreements and policies. Additional tariffs that may be imposed by the U.S. on a broader range of imports from China or other countries, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could result in an increase in supply chain costs that we may not be able to offset or that otherwise adversely impacts our results of operations.\nSimilarly, the U.K.'s exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as \"Brexit,\" has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the U.K. and the E.U., and possibly other countries, including with respect to compliance with the regulatory regimes regarding the labeling and registration of the products we sell in these markets. The U.K. formally left the E.U. on January 31, 2020, starting an 11-month transition period. While we have taken steps to mitigate any disruption to our operations by Brexit, we could face increased regulatory costs, volatility in exchange rates, market instability and other risks, depending on the final terms of the U.K.\u2019s trade deal with the E.U., if any.\nOur net sales and gross profit have varied depending on our product, customer and geographic mix for any given period which makes it difficult to forecast future operating results.\nOur net sales and gross profit vary among our products, customers and markets, and therefore may be different in future periods from historic or current periods. Overall gross profit margins in any given period are dependent in large part on the product, customer and geographic mix reflected in that period\u2019s net sales. Market trends, competitive pressures, commoditization of products, increased component or shipping costs, regulatory conditions and other factors may also result in reductions in revenue or pressure on the gross profit margins in a given period. The varying nature of our product, customer and geographic mix between periods has materially impacted our net sales and gross profit between periods during certain recessionary times and may lead to difficulties in measuring the potential impact of market, regulatory and other factors on our business. As a result, we may be challenged in our ability to forecast our future operating results.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal and state, and other countries' and jurisdictions' income, payroll, property, sales and use, and other types of taxes. Changes in tax rates, enactment of new tax laws, revisions of tax regulations, and claims or litigation with taxing authorities may require significant judgment in determining the appropriate provision and related accruals for these taxes; and as a result, such changes could result in substantially higher taxes and, therefore, could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nCurrently, a significant amount of our net sales are generated from customers located outside of the U.S., and a large portion of our assets and employees are located outside of the U.S. The U.S., the E.U. and member states along with numerous other countries are currently engaged in establishing fundamental changes to tax laws affecting the taxation of multinational corporations. For example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the TCJA which made significant changes to certain U.S. tax laws relevant to us. While interpretation of some of the provisions of the TCJA continues to be subject to uncertainty, and regulatory guidance on certain aspects of the TCJA has not yet been issued, to date the TCJA has had an adverse effect on the U.S. federal income taxation of our operations, including significantly limiting interest expense deductions and imposing new U.S. taxes on certain earnings of non-U.S. entities on a current basis. These and other changes may have an adverse impact on our financial results and on our cash flows in the future. See Note 11, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2019 Annual Report for additional information on the TCJA and its consequences on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and foreign tax authorities in the countries and jurisdictions in which we operate and we may be subject to assessments or audits in the future. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from that which is reflected in our historical financial statements. An audit or litigation can result in significant additional income taxes payable in the jurisdictions in which we operate which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChemical manufacturing is inherently hazardous and may result in accidents, which may disrupt our operations or expose us to significant losses or liabilities.\nThe hazards associated with chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes are inherent in our operations as our research and development, manufacturing, formulating and packaging activities involve the use of hazardous materials and the generation of hazardous waste. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination, discharge or injury resulting from those materials. Also, our suppliers or contract manufacturers may use and/or generate hazardous materials in connection with producing our products. We may be required to indemnify our suppliers, contract manufacturers or waste disposal contractors against damages and other liabilities arising out of the production, handling or storage of our products or raw materials or the disposal of related wastes. Potential risks include explosions and fires, chemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, and pipeline and storage tank leaks and ruptures. Those hazards may result in personal injury and loss of life, damage to property and contamination of the environment, which may result in a suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties and other\nsanctions, cleanup costs, and claims by governmental entities or third-parties. We are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities (including third-party manufacturing on a tolling basis), and the loss or shutdown of operations over an extended period could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations currently use, and have historically used, hazardous materials and generate, and have historically generated, quantities of hazardous waste. As a result, we are subject to regulatory oversight and investigation, remediation, and monitoring obligations at our current and former Superfund sites, as well as third-party disposal sites, under federal laws and their state and local analogues, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), as well as analogous foreign laws. We are also subject to ongoing obligations at active sites in the U.S. and are conducting closure activities pursuant to the RCRA at several of our sites in the U.S. The costs and liabilities associated with these issues may be substantial and, to the extent not covered by insurance, may materially impact the financial health of the Company.\nOur products are subject to numerous, complex government regulations and compliance with these regulations could require us to incur additional costs or to reformulate or discontinue certain of our products.\nOur products are subject to numerous, complex federal, state, local and foreign customs regulations, imports and international trade laws, export control, antitrust laws, environmental and chemicals manufacturing, global climate change, health and safety requirements and zoning and occupancy laws that regulate manufacturers generally or govern the importation, promotion and sale of our products, the operation of factories and warehouse facilities and our relationship with our customers, suppliers, employees and competitors.\nOur products and manufacturing processes are also subject to numerous regulations and ongoing reviews by certain governmental authorities. These regulations include, for example, the European Union REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals) regulation, the REACH regulation\u2019s Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) program, Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act relating to the use in our products of certain \u201cconflict minerals\u201d that are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries, and similar laws in other jurisdictions. These regulations may require us to re-design our products or supply chain to ensure compliance with the applicable standards, for example by requiring the use of different types or sources of materials, which could have an adverse impact on the efficiency of our manufacturing process, the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions or other similar effects, which could materially alter our marketplace position and reputation or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we have incurred, are incurring and will incur in the future, costs and capital expenditures in complying with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. For example, we have several product lines that rely on lead-based solder and many others that historically did so. Legal claims have been brought alleging harmful exposures or contamination as a result of lead-based solder, and it is possible that we may face additional claims in the future. We are also currently involved in various environmental investigations due to historic operations. Liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be joint and several and imposed retroactively, regardless of fault or the legality of the activities that gave rise to the contamination. Some of our formulating and manufacturing facilities have an extended history of chemical formulating and manufacturing operations or other industrial activities, and contaminants have been detected at some of our sites and offsite disposal locations. Ultimate environmental costs and liabilities are difficult to predict and may significantly vary from current estimates. To the extent available, we maintain what we believe to be adequate insurance coverage. However, there can be assurance that we won\u2019t incur losses beyond the limits or outside the terms of such coverage. In addition, the discovery of additional contaminants, the inability or failure of other liable parties to satisfy their obligations, the imposition of additional cleanup obligations, or the commencement of related third-party claims could result in additional material costs and negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nAlthough it is our policy to comply with such laws and regulations, it is possible that we have not been, or may not be at all times, in material compliance with all such requirements. Additionally, these requirements and their enforcement may become more stringent in the future and the ultimate cost of compliance could be material. In particular, changes in environmental and climate laws or regulations could lead to new or additional investment in production designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures, for us and our suppliers. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could also subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur offshore oil industry products are subject to the hazards inherent in the offshore oil production and drilling industry, and we may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards.\nIn the offshore oil industry, we are subject to the hazards inherent in the offshore oil production and drilling industry. Our offshore business produces water-based hydraulic control fluids for major oil companies and drilling contractors to be used for potentially hazardous offshore deepwater production and drilling applications. Offshore deepwater oil production and drilling are subject to hazards that include blowouts, explosions, fires, collisions, capsizing, sinking and damage or loss to pipeline, subsea or other facilities from severe weather conditions. Those hazards could result in personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations. A catastrophic occurrence at a location where our products are used may expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, product liability or commercial claims. To the extent available, we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is customary in our industry. Such insurance does not, however, provide coverage for all liabilities, and there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. The occurrence of a significant offshore deepwater oil production or drilling event that results in liability to us that is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nCertain of our products may be subject to various export control regulations and exports may require a license from the U.S. Department of State or the U.S. Department of Commerce.\nAs a global company, we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the export of products, services, and technology. In the U.S., these laws include, among others, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR), administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), administered by the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. Some of our products or technology may have military or strategic applications governed by the ITAR or represent so-called \u201cdual use\u201d items governed by the EAR. Although our relevant products are currently subject to automatic approval and do not require government licenses to be exported to certain jurisdictions or persons, this may change in the future if these laws and regulations are amended or if new laws or regulations are adopted. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, investigations, adverse publicity and restrictions on our ability to export our products, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the FCPA and other similar anti-corruption laws could subject us to penalties and damage our reputation.\nOur international operations are subject to the FCPA, the Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Under these laws, companies may also be held liable for actions taken by third-parties acting on their behalf, such as strategic or local partners or representatives. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls. However, certain of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business have experienced a heightened risk for corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other improper practices and, despite our training and compliance programs, there is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. Failure by us or our intermediaries to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws may result in civil and/or criminal penalties or other sanctions, including disgorgement of profits and contract suspensions or cancellations, any of which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to comply with international trade restrictions and economic sanctions laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have operations, assets and/or make sales in countries all over the world, including countries that are or may become the target of trade and economic restrictions from the U.S. and/or other countries, which we refer to collectively as \u201cEconomic Sanctions Laws.\u201d Economic Sanctions Laws are complex and change with time as international relationships and confrontations between and among nations evolve. For example, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the U.S. State Department administer certain laws and regulations that impose penalties upon U.S. persons and entities and, in some instances, non-U.S. entities, for conducting activities or transacting business with certain countries, governments, entities, or individuals subject to Economic Sanctions Laws. We have established policies and procedures to assist with our compliance with Economic Sanctions Laws and believe we do not unlawfully conduct business in any sanctioned countries. However, given the breadth of our international operations and the scope of our sales globally, including via third-party distributors over whom we may have limited or no control, coupled with the complexity and ever-changing\nnature of Economic Sanctions Laws, there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures have prevented in the past or will prevent at all times in the future a violation of these laws. Failure to comply with Economic Sanctions Laws, or allegations of such failure, could lead to investigations and/or actions being taken against us which could materially and adversely affect our reputation or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Financial Results, Finances and Capital Structure\nFinancial Performance\nUnfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe reporting currency for our financial statements is the U.S. dollar. However, we have substantial assets, liabilities, net sales and costs denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. To prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements, we must translate those assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at then-applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases and decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our Consolidated Financial Statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency. These translations could result in significant changes to our results of operations from period to period. Additionally, volatility in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial condition, cash flows and liquidity. Although we employ a variety of techniques to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, including foreign currency hedging activities, we cannot guarantee that such risk management strategies will be effective, and our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nChanges in the method for determining London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and/or the replacement of LIBOR could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAmounts drawn under our Credit Agreement may bear interest rates in relation to LIBOR, depending on our selection of repayment options. In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would phase out the use of LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, calculated with a broad set of short-term repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our Credit Agreement and may not be able to do so with terms that are favorable to us. The overall financing market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial markets or the inability to renegotiate our Credit Agreement with favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and operating results.\nAny future impairment of our tangible or intangible long-lived assets may materially affect our results of operations.\nAs a result of our historical Acquisitions, as of December 31, 2019, we had recorded approximately $3.12 billion of intangible assets and goodwill. Under GAAP, we review our intangible assets and long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Additionally, goodwill is subject to an impairment test at least annually. Indicators such as under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, changes in our strategy for our overall business or use of acquired assets, unexpected negative industry or economic trends, decreased market capitalization relative to net book values, unanticipated competitive activities, change in consumer demand, loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired. To the extent any of our acquired assets do not perform as anticipated, whether due to internal or external factors, the value of such assets may be negatively affected and we may be required to record impairment charges. Our results of operations and financial position in future periods could be negatively impacted should future impairments of our long-lived assets, including intangible assets or goodwill, occur.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results in a timely and reliable manner, which could harm our business and adversely impact our stock price.\nWe are required by the SEC to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We are likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any material changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls. We have in the past experienced, and in the future may experience again, material weaknesses and potential problems in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required by the SEC. If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and\nour stock price could drop significantly. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the SEC and the NYSE, we could face severe consequences from those authorities, and our reputation could be harmed which in turn could affect the value of our securities.\nIndebtedness\nOur Credit Agreement and other debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe Credit Agreement, the 5.875% USD Notes Indenture and other debt agreements governing our outstanding debt contain restrictive clauses which may limit our activities and operational and financial flexibility, including, among other things, our ability to grant liens, pay cash dividends, enter new lines of business, repurchase our shares of common stock, make certain investments and engage in certain merger, consolidation or asset sale transactions. In addition, the Credit Agreement includes customary remedies, including the right of the lenders to take action with respect to the collateral securing outstanding loans, that would apply should we default or otherwise be unable to satisfy our debt obligations. These covenants may restrict our flexibility in operating our business. We may also not be able to borrow under the Credit Agreement if an event of default under the terms of this agreement occurs. As a result, we may be unable to pursue certain business initiatives or certain transactions that might otherwise be advantageous, meet extraordinary capital needs, finance future operations, plan for or react to market conditions, or otherwise take actions that we believe are in the best interest of our business which, in turn, may adversely impact our business prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement requires that we meet certain financial ratios, including a first lien net leverage ratio based on net debt to EBITDA. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measures of liquidity defined in the Credit Agreement. Our ability to meet these financial covenants depends upon the future successful operating performance of our businesses. If we fail to comply with the Credit Agreement covenants, we would be in default under the term loan and revolving credit facility, and the maturity of our outstanding debt could be accelerated unless we were able to obtain waivers from our lenders. If we were found to be in default under the term loan and revolving credit facility, it could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, which would result in additional restrictions upon our business and impact our financial condition.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for senior secured credit facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $1.08 billion, consisting of a revolving facility in an aggregate principal amount of $330 million maturing in 2024 and a term loan in an aggregate principal amount of $750 million maturing in 2026. At December 31, 2019, we had $733.4 million outstanding under the term loan and full capacity under the revolver. Despite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Credit Agreement contains restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and any indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Any significant indebtedness incurred by us or our subsidiaries could have the following material consequences:\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022increase the amount of our interest expense, because our borrowings include instruments with variable rates of interest, which, if interest rates increase, would result in higher interest expense;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022limit our ability to make strategic acquisitions, introduce new technologies or exploit business opportunities;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and\n\u2022limit, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds.\nWe may also enter into additional debt transactions or credit facilities, including equipment loans, working capital lines of credit, senior notes and other long-term debt, which may increase our indebtedness and result in additional restrictions upon our businesses. In addition, major debt rating agencies regularly evaluate our debt based on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing debt ratings, and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock and Senior Notes\nWe have numerous equity instruments outstanding that could require the future issuance of additional shares of common stock, which issuance could result in significant dilution of ownership interests and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nWe have a number of equity instruments outstanding that could require us to issue additional shares of our common stock. Depending on the equity instrument, these additional shares may either be issued for no additional consideration or based on a fixed amount of additional consideration. Specifically, at December 31, 2019, we had outstanding the following:\n\u20224,484,757 RSUs which were granted to employees under our 2013 Plan with each RSU representing a contingent right to receive one share of our common stock (assuming performance-based RSUs vest at target level) or multiple shares depending upon the Company's performance;\n\u2022349,009 options which are exercisable to purchase shares of our common stock, on a one-for-one basis, at any time at the option of the holder; and\n\u2022$60 million of potential contingent consideration agreed upon in connection with the MacDermid Acquisition which, at our option, may be paid in shares of our common stock.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had 7,212,987 shares available under the 2013 Plan (subject to increase in accordance with the terms of the 2013 Plan), net of the outstanding RSUs and options noted above, and 4,596,112 shares available under the ESPP.\nAt December 31, 2019, we also had 2,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, which were convertible at any time into shares of our common stock at the option of their holders. All outstanding Series A Preferred Stock were converted into shares of our common stock, on a one-for-one basis, on February 25, 2020.\nVolatility of our stock price could adversely affect us and our stockholders.\nFluctuations in the price of our common stock could negatively affect us and contribute to the loss of all or part of a stockholder\u2019s investment in our Company. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly as a result of:\n\u2022our operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022quarterly or annual variations in our operating results;\n\u2022the public's reaction to our press releases and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022changes in, or failure to meet, earnings estimates, or the publication of research reports by analysts who track our common stock or the stock of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022operating and securities price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations affecting our businesses;\n\u2022strategic actions by us, our customers or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring or other material events, or market rumors regarding such actions;\n\u2022sales of substantial amounts of common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur;\n\u2022shares repurchases or issuance of additional shares of common stock by the Company;\n\u2022additional debt we may incur in the future;\n\u2022changes in key personnel or business strategy;\n\u2022material litigation or governmental investigations;\n\u2022actions by stockholders; and\n\u2022the realization of any risk factors set forth in this 2019 Annual Report.\nMany of the factors listed above are beyond our control and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects. Repurchases of our shares of common stock would also reduce the number of our outstanding shares and might incrementally increase the potential for volatility in our stock by reducing the potential volumes at which our shares may trade in the public markets. There can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not decline in the future. Further, in the past, market fluctuations and price declines\nin a company's stock have led to securities class action litigation. If such a suit were to arise, it could have a substantial cost and divert our resources regardless of the outcome.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, of our common stock may depress the price of our common stock.\nIf any of our executive officers, directors or stockholders sells a large number of shares of our common stock, or if we issue a large number of shares of common stock in connection with future acquisitions, financings or other circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. Moreover, the perception in the public market that we or our stockholders might sell shares of common stock could depress the market price of those shares.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our shares of common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances or sales of our shares will have on the market price of such shares. Sales of substantial amounts of our shares, including sales by significant stockholders, and shares issued in connection with any acquisition, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our shares of common stock. Decline in the stock price of our common stock may also may make it more difficult for us to finance acquisitions with shares of common stock and/or sell additional equity or equity-related securities in future offerings at a time and price we deem necessary or appropriate.\nWe may issue preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock.\nOur Board is authorized to create and issue one or more additional series of preferred stock, and, with respect to each series, to determine the number of shares constituting the series and the designations and the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof, which may include dividend rights, conversion or exchange rights, voting rights, redemption rights and terms and liquidation preferences, without stockholder approval. If we create and issue one or more additional series of preferred stock, it could affect the rights of our common stockholders or reduce the value of our outstanding common stock. Our Board could, without stockholder approval, issue preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock and which could have certain anti-takeover effects.\nThere can be no assurance that we will declare dividends or have available cash to make dividend payments.\nTo the extent the Board, in its sole discretion, decides to pay dividends on our common stock, we will pay dividends at the times and in the amounts as the Board determines appropriate. Should any dividend be declared, we may, however, reduce or discontinue entirely the payment of such dividends at any time. Paying dividends will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements and access to capital markets, covenants associated with the Credit Agreement and other debt obligations, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and other factors that the Board may deem relevant. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will have the ability and/or sufficient funds to pay dividends or as to the amounts of these dividends, if any.\nWe have redeemed in the past, and may redeem or repurchase in the future, our outstanding debt securities which could impact the market for our senior notes and/or negatively affect our liquidity.\nWe may from time to time seek to repurchase, redeem or refinance our outstanding debt securities, including the 5.875% USD Notes due 2025, in open market purchases, accelerated repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers, partial or full calls for redemption or otherwise. Any such repurchases or redemptions and the timing and amount thereof would depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Depending on such timing and amount, our liquidity could be negatively affected.\nWe are dependent on cash flows from our operating subsidiaries to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures and ongoing operations.\nWe do not have any material assets or operations other than ownership of equity interests of our operating subsidiaries. Our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries, and our ability to generate cash to meet our obligations or to pay dividends, if any, is highly dependent on the earnings of, and receipt of funds from, our subsidiaries through dividends or intercompany loans, in particular from MacDermid. As a result, we are dependent on the income generated by our subsidiaries, and to some degree on our ability to repatriate earnings from our foreign operations effectively, to meet our debt service obligations, expenses and operating cash requirements. The amount of distributions and dividends, if any, which may be paid to us from each of our subsidiaries depends on many factors, including the results of operations and financial condition of our subsidiaries, limits on dividends or otherwise under applicable law, constitutional documents of our subsidiaries, documents governing their indebtedness, and other factors which may be outside our control. If our subsidiaries are unable to generate\nsufficient cash flows or if we are unable to repatriate earnings effectively, we may be unable to service our debt obligations, pay our expenses and/or meet our operating cash requirements.\nWe are governed by Delaware law, which has anti-takeover implications.\nWe are governed by Delaware law, the application of which may have the effect of deterring hostile takeover attempts or a change in control. In particular, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes certain restrictions on merger, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock. A Delaware corporation may opt out of that provision either with an express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or in an amendment to its certificate of incorporation or by-laws approved by its stockholders. We have not opted out of this provision. Section 203 could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts and, accordingly, may discourage attempts to acquire us, which may negatively affect our stock price.", "PERMNO": 14406, "SIC": 2890, "TIC": "ESI"}
