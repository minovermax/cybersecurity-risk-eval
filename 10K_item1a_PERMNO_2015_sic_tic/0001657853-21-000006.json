RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and should be carefully considered along with all of the information in this 2020 Annual Report. These risks and uncertainties, however, are not the only risks and uncertainties that we encounter in our operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. In such a case, you may lose all or part of your investment in Hertz Global's common stock or The Hertz Corporation's debt securities. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties. Any of the following risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow and may make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. We believe that the following information identifies the material risks and uncertainties affecting Hertz Global and Hertz; however, the following risks and uncertainties are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us and it is possible that other risks and uncertainties might significantly affect us.\nWe believe that the following information identifies the material risks and uncertainties affecting Hertz Global and Hertz; however, the following risks and uncertainties are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us and it is possible that other risks and uncertainties might significantly affect us.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BANKRUPTCY\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11 Cases and operating under Chapter 11 may restrict our ability to pursue strategic and operational initiatives.\nFor the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases, our operations and our ability to execute our business strategy will be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These risks include:\n\u2022our ability to obtain Bankruptcy Court approval with respect to motions filed in Chapter 11 Cases from time to time;\n\u2022our ability to comply with and operate under the requirements and constraints of the Bankruptcy Code and under any cash management, cash collateral, adequate protection, or other orders entered by the Bankruptcy Court from time to time;\n\u2022our ability to engage in intercompany transactions and to fund operations from cash on hand or from financings and, in the event of such financings, our ability to comply with the terms of such financings;\n\u2022our ability to negotiate and consummate a Chapter 11 plan;\n\u2022our ability to develop, fund, and execute our business plan; and\n\u2022our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThese risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways. For example, negative events or publicity associated with the Chapter 11 Cases have adversely affected certain of our relationships with our suppliers, customers and employees. In particular, critical vendors, suppliers, and/or customers have determined not to do business with us due to the Chapter 11 Cases and we may not be successful in securing alternative sources. Also, transactions outside the ordinary course of business are subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit our ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of opportunities. Additionally, uncertainty with respect to intercompany transactions may negatively impact our captive insurance companies\u2019 ability to meet insurance regulatory requirements. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 process may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and there is no certainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nProsecution of the Chapter 11 Cases has consumed and will continue to consume a substantial portion of the time and attention of our management, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we may face increased levels of employee attrition.\nWhile the Chapter 11 Cases continue, our management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort focusing on the cases. This diversion of attention may materially adversely affect the conduct of our business, and, as a result, our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the Chapter 11 Cases are protracted. During the Chapter 11 Cases, our employees have faced considerable distraction and uncertainty and we have experienced increased levels of employee attrition. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet customer expectations, thereby adversely affecting our business and results of operations. The failure to retain members of our management team and other key personnel could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, thereby having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are in the process of Chapter 11 reorganization cases under the Bankruptcy Code, which may cause our common stock to decrease in value or may render our common stock worthless.\nOn May 22, 2020, we filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court, thereby commencing the Chapter 11 Cases for the Debtors, including Hertz Global. The price of our common stock has been volatile following the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases and may decrease in value or become worthless. Accordingly, any trading in our common stock during the pendency of our Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks to purchasers of our common stock. In addition, on October 29, 2020, Hertz Global received notification from the NYSE that Hertz Global's common stock was no longer suitable for listing on the NYSE and the Company's common stock began trading exclusively on the over-the-counter market on October 30, 2020. Delisting our common stock from the NYSE may adversely impact our liquidity, impair our stockholders' ability to buy and sell our common stock, impair our ability to raise capital, and the market price of our common stock could decrease. Recoveries in the Chapter 11 Cases for holders of common stock, if any, will depend upon our ability to negotiate and confirm a plan, the terms of such plan, the recovery of our business from the COVID-19 pandemic, if any, and the value of our assets. Although we cannot predict how our common stock will be treated under a plan, we expect that common stock holders would not receive a recovery through any plan unless the holders of more senior claims and interests, such as secured and unsecured indebtedness, are paid in full, which would require a significant and rapid improvement in business conditions to pre-COVID-19 or close to pre-COVID-19 levels. We also expect our stockholders\u2019 equity to decrease as we use cash on hand to support our operations in bankruptcy. Consequently, there is a significant risk that the holders of our common stock will receive no recovery under the Chapter 11 Cases and that our common stock will be worthless.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases may limit our ability to offset future U.S. taxable income with tax losses and credits incurred prior to emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases.\nIn connection with our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, we may be able to retain a portion of our U.S. net operating loss (\"NOL\"), capital loss and tax credit carryforwards (collectively, the \u201cTax Attributes\u201d). However, Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) Sections 382 and 383 provide an annual limitation with respect to the ability of a corporation to utilize its Tax Attributes, as well as certain built-in-losses, against future U.S. taxable income in the event of a change in ownership. Our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases will likely be considered a change in ownership for purposes of IRC Section 382. Additionally, any Chapter 11 plan we may implement extinguishing pre-petition debt securities, primary credit facility and other obligations, absent an exception, would result in cancellation of indebtedness income (\u201cCODI\u201d) upon discharge of outstanding indebtedness for an amount of consideration that is less than its adjusted issue price. The IRC provides that a debtor in a bankruptcy case may exclude CODI from income but must reduce certain of its tax attributes by the amount of any CODI realized as a result of the consummation of a Chapter 11 plan. Many states adopt the federal Section 382 rules and therefore have similar limitations with respect to state tax attributes. These events under the IRC are based on the value of the corporation as of the emergence date. As a result, our future U.S. taxable income may not be fully offset by the Tax Attributes if such income exceeds our annual limitation, and we may incur a tax liability with respect to such income. In addition, subsequent changes in ownership for purposes of the IRC could further diminish our Tax Attributes.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nIf we are unable to negotiate and confirm a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, we could be required to liquidate under chapter 7 (\u201cChapter 7\u201d) of the Bankruptcy Code in which case our common stock would likely be worthless.\nWe have not yet negotiated a plan of reorganization with our creditors. If we are unable to negotiate a plan of reorganization that will result in our remaining a going concern, upon a showing of cause, the Bankruptcy Court may convert the Chapter 11 Cases to cases under Chapter 7. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution to creditors in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. Holders of our common stock would likely lose their entire investment in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\nAny Chapter 11 plan that we may implement will likely be based in large part upon assumptions and analyses developed by us. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, or adverse market conditions persist or worsen, our plan may be unsuccessful in its execution.\nAny Chapter 11 plan that we may implement will affect both our capital structure and the ownership, structure and operation of our remaining businesses and will likely reflect assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we consider appropriate under the circumstances. Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with our expectations and assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to (i) our ability to substantially change our capital structure; and (ii) the overall strength and stability of general economic conditions, both in the U.S. and in global markets. The failure of any of these factors could materially adversely affect the successful reorganization of our businesses.\nIn addition, any plan of reorganization will likely rely upon financial projections, including with respect to revenues, consolidated adjusted EBITDA, capital expenditures, debt service and cash flow. Financial forecasts are necessarily speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be accurate. In our case, the forecasts will be even more speculative than normal, because they may involve fundamental changes in the nature of our capital structure. Additionally, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the travel industry in general, and on us, make it even more challenging than usual to develop forecasts on business. Accordingly, we expect that our actual financial condition and results of operations will differ, perhaps materially, from what we have anticipated. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by any plan of reorganization we may implement will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on us and our subsidiaries or our businesses or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could materially adversely affect the successful implementation of any Chapter 11 plan.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Cases, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to confirmation of the plan of reorganization (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization and (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. Any claims not ultimately discharged through a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization could be asserted against the reorganized entities and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on a post-reorganization basis.\nOperating in bankruptcy for a long period of time may harm our business.\nProlonged operations under Bankruptcy Court protection could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. So long as we remain subject to Bankruptcy Court protection, senior management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on business operations. A prolonged period of operating under Bankruptcy Court protection also may continue to make it more difficult to retain management and other key personnel necessary to the success of our business. In addition, the longer we remain under Bankruptcy Court protection, the more likely it\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nis that customers and suppliers will lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully and will seek to establish alternative commercial relationships.\nSo long as we remain under Bankruptcy Court protection, we will be required to incur substantial costs for professional fees and other expenses associated with the administration of the Chapter 11 Cases, including potentially the cost of litigation. In general, litigation can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against. Such litigation could result in settlements or damages that could significantly affect our financial results. It is also possible that certain parties will commence litigation with respect to the treatment of their claims under a Chapter 11 plan. It is not possible to predict the potential litigation that we may become party to, nor the final resolution of such litigation. The impact of any such litigation on our business and financial stability, however, could be material.\nShould the time that we remain under Bankruptcy Court protection be protracted, we may also need to seek new financing to fund operations. If we are unable to obtain such financing on favorable terms or at all, the chances of confirming a Chapter 11 plan may be seriously jeopardized and the likelihood that we will instead be required to liquidate our assets may increase.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nThe effects of the COVID-19 outbreak have been and continue to be disruptive to our vehicle rental business and will likely continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCOVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve and we cannot anticipate with any certainty the length or severity of the effects of COVID-19. The extent to which COVID-19 continues to adversely impact our business will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, such as the following: the ultimate severity of the disease; the duration of the outbreak or future outbreaks; the efficacy of a vaccine rollout in the places that we operate; travel restrictions imposed by governments or businesses in the markets in which we operate; the duration and scope of business closures or business disruptions; changes in customer travel preferences and demand; the impact of increasing unemployment on discretionary spending; the length of time it takes for rental pricing and volume and normal economic conditions to return; technology disruptions; our relationships with vehicle manufacturers; our liquidity position; the development of effective vaccines or treatments; and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain the disease and future outbreaks. The impacts of COVID-19 could include those areas described below:\n\u2022Changes in our revenues, profitability and customer demand in our revenues, profitability and customer demand: Our revenues and profitability have been negatively impacted during 2020 and we expect this to continue for the 2021 fiscal year. We have experienced a high level of rental cancellations and a significant decline in forward bookings due to the decreased customer demand and other economic factors. Historically, we have generated a majority of our rental revenues from on-airport locations, which makes our rental car business sensitive to any decreases in air travel. Although we believe that renting a vehicle will continue to be a safe alternative and we have implemented certain procedures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, we cannot predict when or if customer demand will return to pre-COVID-19 levels.\n\u2022Changes to our liquidity: We incur ongoing costs, which we cannot reduce in line with the significant reduction in revenues we have experienced as a result of COVID-19. Such costs include our monthly fleet rental costs under our Operating Lease, facility rentals and concessions, debt service and labor costs. These costs require significant liquidity generated by operations or access to additional financing. If COVID-19 continues to have a significant negative impact on our cash flow from operations and we cannot access the capital markets, we may not be able to generate sufficient liquidity to cover our costs.\n\u2022Our peak season: The second and third quarters of the year have historically been the strongest quarters for our vehicle rental business due to increased levels of leisure travel. COVID-19 disrupted our business in the second and third quarters of 2020 and we expect that it will continue to disrupt our business unless it is eradicated in 2021. These disruptions have significantly impacted our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nWe do not expect our business to improve until customer demand increases and the global economy improves.\nOur vehicle rental business is particularly sensitive to reductions in the levels of business and leisure travel, and continued reductions in business and leisure travel could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nThe vehicle rental industry is particularly affected by reductions in business and leisure travel, especially with respect to levels of airline passenger traffic. Reductions in levels of air travel, whether caused by general economic conditions, airfare increases (e.g., capacity reductions or increases in fuel costs borne by commercial airlines) or other events (e.g., work stoppages, military conflicts, terrorist incidents, natural disasters, epidemic diseases, or the response of governments to any of these events) could materially adversely affect us. In particular, we derive a substantial proportion of our revenues from key leisure destinations in the U.S., including Florida, Hawaii, California, New York and Texas, and Europe and the level of travel to these destinations is dependent upon the ability and willingness of consumers to travel on vacation and the effect of economic cycles on consumers\u2019 discretionary travel, including shortages of fuel and increases or volatility in fuel costs. In 2020 and as a result of COVID-19, business and leisure travel were adversely affected and our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows were materially adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition that may lead to downward pricing or an inability to increase prices.\nWe believe that price is one of the primary competitive factors in the vehicle rental market and that technology has enabled cost-conscious customers, including business travelers, to compare rates available from rental companies more easily. If we try to increase our pricing, our competitors, some of whom may have greater resources and better access to capital than us, may seek to compete aggressively on the basis of pricing. In addition, our competitors may reduce prices in order to, among other things, attempt to gain a competitive advantage, capture market share or compensate for declines in rental activity. Additionally, pricing in the vehicle rental industry is impacted by the supply of vehicles available for rent. Any significant fluctuations in the supply of rental vehicles available in the market due to an unexpected decrease in demand, or actions taken by our competitors could negatively affect our pricing, operating plans or results of operations if we are unable to adjust the size of our rental fleet in response to fluctuations in supply and demand. We also compete with non-traditional companies for vehicle rental market share, including auto manufacturers, ride-hailing and car sharing companies and other competitors in the mobility industry. To the extent we do not react appropriately to our competition or optimize our revenue and pricing strategies, we may experience sub-optimal pricing decisions, sub-optimal asset utilization, poor customer satisfaction, lost revenue and other unfavorable consequences which may materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur business is highly seasonal and any occurrence that disrupts rental activity during our peak periods could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nCertain significant components of our expenses are fixed in the short-term, including minimum concession fees, real estate taxes, rent, insurance, utilities, facility-related expenses, the costs of operating our information technology systems and minimum staffing costs. Seasonal changes in our revenues do not affect those fixed expenses, typically resulting in higher profitability in periods when our revenues are higher. The second and third quarters of the year have historically been the strongest quarters for our vehicle rental business due to increased levels of leisure travel. We control certain of our costs, including fleet arrangements and availability, to manage seasonal variations in demand. Any circumstance, occurrence or situation that disrupts rental activity during these critical periods could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to a significant change in revenue. In 2020, our peak rental season was materially affected by COVID-19 and we experienced a significant reduction in demand. This disruption in rental activity resulted in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nIf we are unable to accurately estimate future levels of rental activity and adjust the number, location and mix of vehicles used in our rental operations accordingly, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could suffer.\nVehicle costs typically represent our largest expense and vehicle purchases are typically made weeks or months in advance of the expected use of the vehicle. Accordingly, our business is dependent upon the ability of our management to accurately estimate future levels of rental activity and consumer preferences with respect to the mix of vehicles used in our rental operations and the location of those vehicles. If we are unable to purchase a sufficient number of vehicles, or the right types of vehicles, to meet consumer demand, we may lose revenue or market share to our competitors. If we purchase too many vehicles, our Vehicle Utilization could be adversely affected and we may not be able to dispose of excess vehicles in a timely and cost-effective manner. In early 2020 and due to COVID-19, we experienced significant excess in our vehicle supply due to reduced demand. Increased fleet adversely affected our Vehicle Utilization and we implemented strategies to reduce our fleet to align with demand at the time. Our failure to utilize a flexible and systematic process for fleet management that accurately estimates future levels of rental activity and determines the appropriate mix of vehicles used in our rental operations may result in obsolescence and excessive aging of fleet, the inability to sell fleet at adequate prices, sub-optimal fleet utilization, increased fleet costs, lower customer satisfaction, sub-optimal fleet sizing, lost or missing fleet assets, reduced margins and cash flows and other unfavorable consequences which may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nIncreased vehicle cost due to declining values of our non-program vehicles in our operations could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nManufacturers agree to repurchase program vehicles at a specified price or guarantee the depreciation rate on the vehicles during a specified time period. We sell our non-program vehicles through various sales channels in the used vehicle market, including auctions, dealer direct sales and retail lots through our car sales program, and have an increased risk that the net amount realized upon the disposition of the vehicle will be less than its estimated residual value at such time. Any decrease in residual values of our non-program vehicles could result in a substantial loss on the sale of such vehicles or accelerated depreciation while we own the vehicles, which can materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWhile program vehicles generally cost more than comparable non-program vehicles, the use of program vehicles enables us to forecast our depreciation expense with more precision. Using program vehicles is also useful in managing our seasonal peak demand for vehicles because we may be able to sell certain program vehicles shortly after having acquired them at a higher value than what we could for a similar non-program vehicle at that time. If there were fewer program vehicles in our rental operations, these benefits would diminish and we would bear increased risk related to residual value. In addition, the related depreciation on our vehicles and our flexibility to reduce the number of vehicles used in our rental operations by returning vehicles sooner than originally expected without the risk of loss in the event of an economic downturn or to respond to changes in rental demand would be reduced.\nThe market for used vehicles is subject to economic factors, such as demand, consumer interests, pricing of new car models, fuel costs and other general economic conditions and may not produce stable vehicle prices in the future. A reduction in residual values for vehicles in our rental fleet could cause us to sustain a substantial loss on the sale of vehicles or require us to depreciate those vehicles at a higher rate. Our vehicle costs could increase due to any reduction in the market value of our vehicles, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe may fail to adequately respond to changes in technology, customer demands and market competition.\nOur industry has recently been characterized by rapid changes in technology innovation and deployment to address evolving customer demands, improve operational efficiency and disrupt competitive dynamics. Examples of such use by industry participants include addressing increasing expectations of personalized, efficient and mobile-first experiences across services; optimizing maintenance costs, improving vehicle utilization and maximizing the costs of asset ownership; and enabling traditional and non-traditional competitors to introduce new transportation\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nofferings, consumption models and vehicle platforms, including electric and autonomous vehicles and other potentially disruptive technologies. Our ability to continually improve our technology platforms, processes and products in this environment is essential to maintain a competitive position in customer satisfaction, market share and other areas. Due to natural complexity in technology innovation, potentially high costs of certain initiatives, hiring and retention challenges and impacts from our financial restructuring, we may experience technical or other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development, introduction or marketing of new products or enhanced product offerings. These challenges related to emerging technology may result in loss of competitive differentiation, margin erosion, departure of key partners, declining market share, inability to achieve growth targets, inefficient or outdated service delivery platforms, loss of key customers and brand erosion, declining employee morale, inability to attract or retain key talent and other unfavorable consequences which may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to purchase adequate supplies of competitively priced vehicles and the cost of the vehicles we purchase increases, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nOur vehicle purchase strategies can be affected by commercial, economic, market and other conditions. For example, certain vehicle manufacturers have occasionally utilized strategies to reduce sales to the vehicle rental industry, which can negatively affect our ability to obtain vehicles on competitive terms and conditions. Consequently, there is no guarantee that we can purchase a sufficient number of vehicles at competitive prices and on competitive terms and conditions. Additionally, as a result of our restructuring, we were unable to purchase vehicles until late 2020, which may affect our fleet availability and desirability in 2021. Manufacturers of vehicles are also facing a shortage of microprocessors and other digital devices used to control engines and transmissions, which may affect the availability of vehicles being produced. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of vehicles, or if we obtain less favorable pricing and other terms during the acquisition of vehicles and are unable to recover from the increased costs, then our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nThe recognition of previously-deferred tax gains on the disposition of revenue earning vehicles may not be fully offset by full expensing of newly-purchased revenue earning vehicles.\nA material and extended reduction in vehicle purchases by our U.S. vehicle rental business and Donlen business, for any reason, could require us to make material cash payments for U.S. federal and state income tax liabilities. We cannot offer assurance that allowances for the full expensing of purchased revenue earning vehicles in the future will exceed previously deferred tax gains realized upon the disposition of revenue earning vehicles maintained under the like-kind exchange (\"LKE\") program.\nBeginning in 2018, the TCJA eliminated the deferral of tax gains on the disposition of revenue earning vehicles maintained under our LKE program. While we expect that additional deductions provided by the TCJA for 100% expensing of vehicles purchased after September 27, 2017 and placed in service before December 31, 2022 could offset the previously-deferred tax gains realized upon the disposition of revenue earning vehicles maintained under the LKE program, we can offer no assurance that these deductions will fully offset tax gains realized upon the disposition of revenue earning vehicles.\nIn addition, the TCJA lowers the 100% expensing by 20% per year beginning in 2023, fully eliminating the expensing by 2027. This change could result in the Company being required to make future material cash tax payments on the sales of revenue earning vehicles. We cannot predict if or when legislation would be enacted in the future to allow full or partial expensing of purchased revenue earning vehicles or to allow deferral of tax gains on the dispositions of revenue earning vehicles.\nSection 163(j) of the TCJA also impacts our ability to fully expense the costs of purchased revenue earning vehicles. This provision generally limits the deductibility of business interest expense to a percentage of taxpayer\u2019s adjusted taxable income. However, certain financing arrangements are not eligible for 100% expensing of the costs of the purchased vehicles. Our ability to fully expense such costs may be impacted by the nature of financing transactions.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nThese events may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nThe failure of a manufacturer of our program vehicles to fulfill its obligations under a repurchase or guaranteed depreciation program could expose us to losses on those program vehicles.\nIf any manufacturer of our program vehicles does not fulfill its obligations under its repurchase or guaranteed depreciation agreement with us, whether due to default, reorganization, bankruptcy or otherwise, then we would have to dispose of those program vehicles without receiving the benefits of the associated repurchase programs. In addition, we could be left with a substantial unpaid claim against the manufacturer with respect to program vehicles that were sold and returned to the manufacturer but not paid for, or that were sold for less than their agreed repurchase price or guaranteed value.\nThe failure by a manufacturer to pay such amounts could cause a credit enhancement deficiency under our asset-backed and asset-based financing arrangements, requiring us to either reduce the outstanding principal amount of debt or provide more collateral (in the form of cash, vehicles and/or certain other contractual rights) to the creditors under any such affected arrangement.\nIf one or more manufacturers were to adversely modify or eliminate repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs in the future, our access to and the terms of asset-backed and asset-based debt financing could be adversely affected, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nManufacturer safety recalls could create risks to our business.\nThe Raechel and Jacqueline Houck Safe Rental Car Act of 2015 prohibits us from renting or selling vehicles with open federal safety recalls and requires us to repair or address these recalls prior to renting or selling the vehicle. Any federal safety recall would require us to cease renting recalled vehicles until we can react to the recall. We cannot control the number of vehicles that may be subject to manufacturer recalls. If a large number of vehicles are the subject of a recall or if needed replacement parts are not in adequate supply, we may not be able to rent recalled vehicles for a significant period of time. These types of disruptions could jeopardize our ability to fulfill existing contractual commitments or satisfy demand for our vehicles and could also result in the loss of business to our competitors. Depending on the severity of any recall, it could materially adversely affect, among other things, our revenues, create customer service problems, present liability claims, reduce the residual value of the recalled vehicles and harm our general reputation.\nWe rely on third-party distribution channels for a significant amount of our revenues.\nThird-party distribution channels account for a significant amount of our vehicle rental reservations. These third-party distribution channels include traditional and online travel agencies, third-party internet sites, airlines and hotel companies, marketing partners such as credit card companies and membership organizations and global distribution systems that allow travel agents, travel service providers and customers to connect directly to our reservations systems. Loss of access to any of these channels, changes in pricing or commission structures or a reduction in transaction volume could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations, liquidity and cash flows, particularly if our customers are unable to access our reservation systems through alternate channels.\nIf our customers develop loyalty to travel intermediaries rather than our brands, our financial results may suffer.\nCertain internet travel intermediaries use generic indicators of the type of vehicle (such as \u201cstandard\u201d or \u201ccompact\u201d) at the expense of brand identification and some intermediaries have launched their own loyalty programs to develop loyalties to their reservation system rather than to our brands. If the volume of sales made through internet travel intermediaries increases significantly and consumers develop stronger loyalties to these intermediaries rather than to our brands, our business and revenues could be affected. Additionally, if our market share suffers due to lower\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nlevels of customer loyalty, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur foreign operations expose us to risks that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur foreign operations generate revenue outside the U.S. Accordingly, operating in many different countries exposes us to varying risks, which include: (i) multiple, and sometimes conflicting, foreign regulatory requirements and laws that are subject to change and are often much different than the domestic laws in the U.S., including laws relating to taxes, automobile-related liability, insurance rates, insurance products, consumer privacy, data security, employment matters, cost and fee recovery, and the protection of our trademarks and other intellectual property; (ii) the effect of foreign currency translation risk, as well as limitations on our ability to repatriate income; (iii) varying tax regimes, including consequences from changes in applicable tax laws and our ability to repatriate cash from non-U.S. affiliates without adverse tax consequences; (iv) local ownership or investment requirements, as well as difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations; and (v) political and economic instability, natural calamities, war, and terrorism. In 2020, as a result of COVID-19, we experienced significant reduction in demand for our vehicles and as a result, our financial performance in our international operations were materially affected.\nThe effects of these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur business is heavily reliant upon communications networks and centralized information technology systems and the concentration of our systems creates risks for us.\nWe rely heavily on communication networks and information technology systems to, among other things, accept reservations, process rental and sales transactions, manage our pricing, manage our revenue earning vehicles, manage our financing arrangements, account for our activities and otherwise conduct our business. Our reliance on these networks and systems exposes us to various risks that could cause a loss of reservations, interfere with our ability to manage our vehicles, delay or disrupt rental and sales processes, adversely affect our ability to comply with our financing arrangements and otherwise materially adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively. Our major information technology systems, reservations and accounting functions are centralized in a few locations worldwide. Any disruption, termination or substandard provision of these services, whether as the result of localized conditions (e.g., fire, explosion or hacking), failure of our systems to function as designed, or as the result of events or circumstances of broader geographic impact (e.g., earthquake, storm, flood, epidemic, strike, act of war, civil unrest or terrorist act), could materially adversely affect our business by disrupting normal reservations, customer service, accounting and information technology functions or by eliminating access to financing arrangements. Any disruption or poor performance of our systems could lead to lower revenues, increased costs or other material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nFailure to maintain, upgrade and consolidate our information technology systems could adversely affect us.\nWe are continuously evaluating, upgrading and consolidating our systems, including making changes to legacy systems, replacing legacy systems with successor systems with new functionality and acquiring new systems with new functionality. In addition, we outsource a significant portion of our information technology services. These types of activities subject us to additional costs and inherent risks associated with outsourcing, replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our ability to manage our business, potential disruption of our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, additional administration and operating expenses, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems, demands on management time, potential delays or disruptions from upgrading and consolidating our systems and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to outsourcing alternatives, new systems or integrating new systems into our current systems. Failure to maintain a comprehensive technology enablement and effective processes may result in an inability to support business growth expectations, excessive overhead costs, high rates of transaction failures and rework, detrimental impact to customers, excessive write-offs and potential litigation, service quality issues, declining employee morale, loss of key talent and other unfavorable consequences. In addition, the implementation\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nof our technology initiatives and systems may cause disruptions in our business operations by severely degrading performance or a complete loss of service and have an adverse effect on our business and operations if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated and our competitive position may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain systems that allow us to manage our business in a competitive manner.\nOur commercial off airport leases and airport concession agreements expose us to risks.\nWe maintain a substantial network of vehicle rental locations at off airport and airport locations in the U.S. and internationally. If we are unable to continue operating these facilities at their current locations due to the termination of leases or vehicle rental concessions at airports, which comprise a majority of our revenues, our operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, if the costs of these leases and/or concession agreements increase and we are unable to increase our pricing structure to offset the increased costs, our financial results could suffer. In 2020 and as a result COVID-19, our restructuring and strategic decisions, we may not experience the same amount of revenue from vehicle rentals at leased locations and our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be materially.\nMaintaining favorable brand recognition is essential to our success, and failure to do so could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur business is heavily dependent upon the favorable brand recognition that our \u201cHertz\u201d, \u201cDollar\u201d and \u201cThrifty\u201d brand names have in the markets in which they participate. Factors affecting brand recognition are often outside our control, and our efforts to maintain or enhance favorable brand recognition, such as marketing and advertising campaigns, may not have their desired effects. In addition, although our licensing partners are subject to contractual requirements to protect our brands, it may be difficult to monitor or enforce such requirements, particularly in foreign jurisdictions and various laws may limit our ability to enforce the terms of these agreements or to terminate the agreements. Any decline in perceived favorable recognition of our brands could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe may face issues with our union-represented employees.\nActive labor contracts covering the terms of employment for the Company's union-represented employees in the U.S. (including those in the U.S. territories) are presently in effect, primarily with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the International Association of Machinists. These contracts are renegotiated periodically and we anticipate renegotiating labor contracts with approximately 57% of these employees in 2021. Failure to negotiate a new labor agreement when required could result in a work stoppage. Although we believe that our labor relations have generally been good, it is possible that we could become subject to additional work rules imposed by agreements with labor unions, or that work stoppages or other labor disturbances could occur in the future. In addition, our non-union-represented workforce has been subject to unionization efforts in the past, and we could be subject to future unionization, which could lead to increases in our operating costs and/or constraints on our operating flexibility.\nIf there is a determination that any of the Spin-Off or the internal spin-off transactions completed in connection with the Spin-Off (collectively with the Spin-Off, the \u201cSpin-Offs\u201d) is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes because the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings underlying the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") private letter ruling or tax opinions are incorrect or for any other reason, then Herc Holdings and its stockholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities and Hertz Global could incur significant liabilities.\nIn connection with the Spin-Offs, Herc Holdings received a private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that, subject to the accuracy of and compliance with certain representations, assumptions and covenants, (i) the Spin-Off will qualify as a tax-free transaction under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, and (ii) the internal spin-off transactions will qualify as tax free under Section 355 of the Code. A private letter ruling from the IRS generally is binding on the IRS. However, the IRS ruling did not rule that the Spin-Offs satisfied every requirement for a tax-free spin-off, and Herc Holdings and Hertz Global relied solely on opinions of professional advisors to determine that such additional requirements were satisfied. The ruling and the opinions relied on certain facts, assumptions,\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nrepresentations and undertakings from Herc Holdings and Hertz Holdings regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, Herc Holdings and Hertz Global, and their affiliates may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions of tax advisors and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax advisors, the IRS could determine on audit that the Spin-Offs and related transactions are taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for any other reason, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of Herc Holdings or Hertz Global after the Spin-Off. If the Spin-Offs or related transactions are determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Herc Holdings and Hertz Global and, in certain cases, their stockholders (at the time of the Spin-Off) could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, including taxation on the value of the Hertz Global stock distributed in the Spin-Off and the value of other companies distributed in the internal Spin-Off transactions, and Hertz Global could incur significant liabilities, either directly to the tax authorities or under a Tax Matters Agreement entered into with Herc Holdings.\nOur ability to use certain of our tax assets may have been limited or may become limited in the future, exposing some or all of the tax assets to expiration.\nOn May 26, 2020, entities affiliated with Carl Icahn filed a Schedule 13D/A indicating that they sold approximately 38.9% of our outstanding stock. Although we are still analyzing the impact of this sale, we believe that such sale resulted in an \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382 of the federal income tax rules. In general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of Hertz Global\u2019s ownership of one or more \u201cfive-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined in the Code) has increased by more than fifty percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years, calculated on a rolling basis. An \u201cownership change\u201d could significantly limit our ability to utilize tax attributes, including NOLs, capital loss carryovers, excess foreign tax carry forwards, and credit carryforwards, to offset future taxable income and tax liabilities. An entity that experiences an \u201cownership change\u201d generally should be subject to an annual limitation on its pre-ownership change tax loss carryforward equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term, tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the IRS (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation accumulates each year to the extent that there is any unused limitation from a prior year. We anticipate that any limitations under Section 382 should not limit our ability to use such tax attributes to offset future taxable income and tax liabilities. Nonetheless, our potential limitations on our ability to use such tax attributes is uncertain. If we experience a subsequent ownership change, however, it is possible that a significant portion of our tax attributes will expire before we would be able to use them to offset future taxable income. Our NOL utilization was statutorily limited under TCJA which limited a taxpayers\u2019 ability to use NOLs to 80% of taxable income, disallowed the carryback of NOLs arising after 2017, and made the carryforward of NOLs indefinite. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \"CARES Act\") temporarily suspends the TCJA\u2019s 80% limitation on the use of NOLs for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2021. Such limitations on NOL utilization may impact our cash tax position materially. Many states adopt the federal Section 382 rules and therefore have similar limitations with respect to state tax attributes.\nWe face risks related to liabilities and insurance.\nOur businesses expose us to claims for personal injury, death and property damage resulting from the use of the vehicles rented or sold by us, and for employment-related injury claims by our employees. The Company is currently a defendant in numerous actions and has received numerous claims for which actions have not yet been commenced for public liability and property damage arising from the operation of motor vehicles rented from the Company. We generally self-insure up to $10 million per occurrence globally and the Company has $200 million insurance coverage excess of retentions. We cannot assure you that we will not be exposed to uninsured liability at levels in excess of our historical levels resulting from multiple payouts or otherwise, that liabilities in respect of existing or future claims will not exceed the level of our insurance or reserves, that we will have sufficient capital available to pay any uninsured claims or that insurance with unaffiliated carriers will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all.

We cannot guarantee that the tanks will at all times remain free from leaks or that the use of these tanks will not result in significant spills or leakage. If a leak or a spill occurs, it is possible that the resulting costs of cleanup, investigation and remediation, as well as any resulting fines, could be significant. Compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations may require material expenditures by us or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows. See Item 1, \u2018\u2018Business-Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters\u2019\u2019 in this 2020 Annual Report.\nThe U.S. Congress and other legislative and regulatory authorities in the U.S. and internationally have considered, and will likely continue to consider, numerous measures related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. Should rules establishing limitations on greenhouse gas emissions or rules imposing fees on entities deemed to be responsible for greenhouse gas emissions become effective, demand for our services could be affected, our vehicle, and/or other, costs could increase, and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may pursue strategic transactions which could be difficult to implement, disrupt our business or change our business profile significantly.\nAny future strategic acquisition or disposition of assets or a business could involve numerous risks, including: (i) potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; (ii) difficulty integrating the acquired business or segregating assets and operations to be disposed of; (iii) exposure to unknown, contingent or other liabilities, including litigation arising in connection with the acquisition or disposition or against any business we may acquire; (iv) changing our business profile in ways that could have unintended negative consequences; and (v) the failure to achieve anticipated synergies. If we enter into significant strategic transactions, the related accounting charges may affect our financial condition and results of operations, particularly in the case of an acquisition. The financing of any significant acquisition may result in changes in our capital structure, including the incurrence of additional indebtedness. A material disposition could require the amendment or refinancing of our outstanding indebtedness or a portion thereof. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement to sell substantially all of the Donlen Assets and the sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. It is possible that the sale of the Donlen Assets will have unintended negative consequences to our business.\nChanges in the U.S. legal and regulatory environment that affect our operations, including laws and regulations relating to accounting principles, taxes, automobile related liability, insurance rates, insurance products, consumer privacy, data security, employment matters, licensing and franchising, used-car sales (including retail sales), cost and fee recovery and the banking and financing industry could disrupt our business, increase our expenses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of U.S. laws and regulations and changes in the level of government regulation of our business have the potential to materially alter our business practices and materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. Those changes may occur through new laws and regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations.\nIn addition, the current domestic and international political environment, including government shutdowns and changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs, has resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy. The U.S. federal government may propose additional changes to international trade\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nagreements, tariffs, taxes, and other government rules and regulations. These regulatory changes could significantly impact our business and financial performance.\nAny new, or change in existing, U.S. law and regulation with respect to optional insurance products or policies could increase our costs of compliance or make it uneconomical to offer such products, which would lead to a reduction in revenue and profitability. For further discussion regarding how changes in the regulation of insurance intermediaries may affect us, see Item 1, \u2018\u2018Business-Insurance and Risk Management\u2019\u2019 in this 2020 Annual Report. If customers decline to purchase supplemental liability insurance products from us as a result of any changes in these laws or otherwise, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe derive revenue through rental activities of our brands under franchise and license arrangements. These arrangements are subject to various international, federal and state laws and regulations that impose limitations on our interactions with counterparties. In addition, the used-vehicle sale industry, including our network of company-operated retail vehicle sales locations, is subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, such as those relating to motor vehicle sales, retail installment sales and related finance and insurance matters, advertising, licensing, consumer protection and consumer privacy. Changes in these laws and regulations that impact our franchising and licensing agreements or our used-vehicle sales could adversely affect our results.\nIn most jurisdictions where we operate, we pass-through various expenses, including the recovery of vehicle licensing costs and airport concession fees, to our rental customers as separate charges. We believe that our expense pass-throughs, where imposed, are properly disclosed and are lawful. However, in the event of incorrect calculations or disclosures with respect to expense pass-throughs, or a successful challenge to the methodology we have used for determining our expense pass-through treatment, we could be subject to fines or other liabilities. In addition, we may in the future be subject to potential legislative, regulatory or administrative changes or actions which could limit, restrict or prohibit our ability to separately state, charge and recover vehicle licensing costs and airport concession fees, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nCertain proposed or enacted laws and regulations with respect to the banking and finance industries, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (including risk retention requirements) and amendments to the SEC's rules relating to asset-backed securities, could restrict our access to certain financing arrangements and increase our financing costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nA business continuity plan is necessary for our global business.\nWe have a business continuity plan designed to (i) identify key assets, operations and underlying threats, (ii) define and assess relevant threats (e.g., natural disasters, pandemics, terrorism, etc.) on business operations, (iii) develop and categorize action plans to minimize the impact of the identified threats and (iv) test the adequacy of our action plans. Our business continuity facilitated our response to COVID-19 in 2020 but the significant reduction in demand materially affected our action plans. If our business continuity plan fails to operate as intended, we may experience significant business disruptions, release of confidential information, malicious corruption of data, regulatory intervention and sanctions, prolonged negative publicity, litigation and liabilities, product and service quality failures, irreparable harm to customer relationships and other unfavorable consequences which may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR SUBSTANTIAL INDEBTEDNESS\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows and ability to compete in our industry.\nOur substantial pre-petition indebtedness could materially adversely affect our business by making it more difficult for us to negotiate a resolution of our obligations to the holders of our outstanding debt securities and to the lenders under our various credit facilities upon emergence from Bankruptcy Court protection. Such negotiations will be\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nhighly dependent on our ability to (i) establish a restructuring plan that is satisfactory to the holders of our pre-petition indebtedness, (ii) demonstrate an ability to generate and/or project sufficient cash flows to support new or refinanced indebtedness at an appropriate level of capitalization and (iii) demonstrate an ability to generate and/or project return on capital in excess of new or refinanced debt service which can require sufficient equity capital to establish an appropriate capitalization of our balance sheet. Our ability to raise new financing, and the terms of any such refinancing, will be highly dependent on the economic environment, the state of the travel industry and related effects from COVID-19 and the resulting competitive conditions in our markets.\nTo the extent we emerge from Bankruptcy Court protection with a high level or otherwise high cost of indebtedness relative to our competitors, we will continue to face increased vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions (such as credit-related disruptions), which will place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have proportionately less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates or on better terms; and limit our ability to react to competitive pressures and make it difficult for us to carry out capital program spending that is necessary or important to our growth strategy and our efforts to improve operating margins. In 2020 and as a result of COVID-19, we experienced certain of these events and were unable to comply with certain restrictive covenants in certain of our financing agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness, which contributed to our decision to commence the Chapter 11 Cases. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, we entered into the DIP Credit Agreement, which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on October 29, 2020 and further described below. For a description of the amounts we have available under certain of our debt facilities, see Note 6, \"Debt,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this 2020 Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nOur ability to manage these risks depends on financial market conditions as well as our financial and operating performance, which, in turn, is subject to a wide range of risks, including those described under \u201cRisks Related to Our Business and Industry.\u201d\nThere is no certainty as to the amount of vehicle lease payments we will be required to make during the pendency of the bankruptcy case.\nWe leased the bulk of our vehicles used in our U.S. rental car operations under the Operating Lease. The Operating Lease requires material monthly rental payments for the use of the vehicles, and those rental payments may vary significantly under the terms of the Operating Lease. Prior to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, we failed to make the April 2020 rent payment under the Operating Lease, and the lessor has a Pre-petition claim for the unpaid April rent. In addition, under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, we were not required to make, and did not make, the May and June 2020 rent payments. Ultimately, the lessor will have the right to seek an administrative claim against us for an amount that the Bankruptcy Court determines to be equal to the actual and necessary benefit to us for the use of the vehicles during this period. We cannot predict the amount of such claim with any degree of certainty.\nOn June 11, 2020, we filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to reject the leases of approximately 144,000 cars under the Operating Lease (the \u201cOperating Lease Rejection Motion\u201d), to which certain lenders under, and other parties to, the related ABS program (collectively, the \u201cABS Lenders\u201d) objected. On July 24, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Interim Lease Order that contained an interim settlement and agreement to suspend litigation relating to the Operating Lease Rejection Motion until January 15, 2021, as well as other issues related to the Operating Lease. As part of the settlement, we agreed to, among other things, dispose of at least 182,521 vehicles leased under the Operating Lease and make certain cash lease payments in amounts less than provided under the terms of the Operating Lease. The settlement did not finally resolve our ultimate liability for rent payments under the Operating Lease.\nOn January 20, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Second Lease Order extending, with certain modifications, the terms of the settlement with respect to the Operating Lease embodied in the Interim Lease Order through September 30, 2021. There is no assurance that we will come to further agreement with the ABS Lenders after the current agreement expires on September 30, 2021 and, consequently, there is no certainty as to amount of vehicle lease payments we will be required to make under the Operating Lease.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nIf our business does not recover quickly and we are unable to successfully restructure our substantial indebtedness, obtain further waivers or forbearance or raise additional capital, there is substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern.\nAs a result of the adverse impact from COVID-19 and the uncertainty about the timing and strength of recovery in our markets, Hertz did not make certain payments in accordance with the Operating Lease, pursuant to which Hertz leases vehicles used in its U.S. rental car operations. As a result of the failure to make the full rent payments, as of May 5, 2020, an amortization event was in effect for all series of notes issued by HVF II and a liquidation event was in effect with respect to the Series 2013-A Notes issued by HVF II. As a result of the amortization event, and notwithstanding the forbearance agreement described below, proceeds of the sales of vehicles that collateralize the notes issued by HVF II must be applied to the payment of principal and interest under those notes and will not be available to finance new vehicle acquisitions for Hertz. A liquidation event means that, unless the affected noteholders otherwise agree, the affected noteholders can direct the liquidation of vehicles serving as collateral for their notes.\nOn May 4, 2020, prior to the occurrence of the liquidation event with respect to the Series 2013-A Notes, Hertz, HVF, HVF II and DTG Operations, Inc. entered into the Forbearance Agreement with the VFN Noteholders. Pursuant to the Forbearance Agreement that is effective against all VFN Noteholders, the VFN Noteholders agreed to forbear from exercising their liquidation remedies. The agreement with the VFN Noteholders expired on May 22, 2020. Concurrently with entering into the Forbearance Agreement, on May 4, 2020, Hertz entered into the Waiver Agreements with certain of the Lenders under its Facilities. Pursuant to the Waiver Agreements, the Lenders agreed to waive any default or event of default that could have resulted from the above referenced missed payment under the Operating Lease, waive certain defaults or events of default and extend the grace period to cure a default with respect to Hertz\u2019s obligation to reimburse drawings that occurred under certain letters of credit during the waiver period. The Waiver Agreements expired on May 22, 2020.\nIn connection with the expiration of the Forbearance Agreement and the Waiver Agreements and the continuing economic impact from COVID-19, on the Petition Date, the Debtors filed voluntary Petitions under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. The Bankruptcy Court approved motions filed by the Debtors that were designed primarily to mitigate the impact of the Chapter 11 Cases on the Company\u2019s operations, customers and employees. The Debtors are authorized to conduct their business activities in the ordinary course, and pursuant to orders entered by the Bankruptcy Court, the Debtors are authorized to, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions of such orders, (i) pay employees\u2019 wages and related obligations; (ii) pay certain taxes; (iii) pay critical vendors and certain fees to airport authorities and provide adequate protection; (iv) continue to maintain certain customer programs; (v) maintain insurance programs; (vi) use certain cash collateral on an interim basis; (vii) honor certain obligations to franchisees; and (viii) maintain existing cash management systems.\nAs part of its bankruptcy restructuring, Hertz has been and expects to be in discussions with key stakeholders and advisors to develop a financing strategy and structure that better reflects the economic impact of COVID-19 and Hertz\u2019s ongoing operating and financing requirements. However, there can be no assurances that Hertz will be able to successfully restructure its substantial indebtedness.\nAlthough the Operating Lease Order from the Bankruptcy Court was helpful to us, if our business does not recover and we cannot reach agreement to restructure our indebtedness, we may not be able to meet our obligations under our debt facilities and may not have sufficient cash flows from operations or liquidity to sustain our operations. In such circumstances, we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nOur reliance on asset-backed and asset-based financing arrangements to purchase vehicles subjects us to a number of risks, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe rely significantly on asset-backed and asset-based financing to purchase vehicles. If we are unable to refinance or replace our existing asset-backed and asset-based financing or continue to finance new vehicle acquisitions through asset-backed or asset-based financing on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, then our costs of\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC.

RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nfinancing could increase significantly and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, interest costs, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur asset-backed and asset-based financing capacity could be decreased, our financing costs and interest rates could be increased, or our future access to the financial markets could be limited, as a result of risks and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, including: (i) the acceptance by credit markets of the structures and structural risks associated with our asset-backed and asset-based financing arrangements; (ii) the credit ratings provided by credit rating agencies for our asset-backed indebtedness; (iii) third parties requiring changes in the terms and structure of our asset-backed or asset-based financing arrangements, including increased credit enhancement or required cash collateral and/or other liquid reserves; (iv) the insolvency or deterioration of the financial condition of one or more of our principal vehicle manufacturers; or (v) changes in laws or regulations, including judicial review of issues of first impression, that negatively affect any of our asset-backed or asset-based financing arrangements. Although we have continued to maintain access to asset-backed financing during the Chapter 11 Cases, the cost of such facilities has been in excess of costs incurred by our competitors. While we remain under the protection of the Bankruptcy Court, we expect that this competitive disadvantage will continue and there can be no assurance that upon emergence from Bankruptcy Court protection that such disadvantage will not continue.\nAny reduction in the value of certain revenue earning vehicles could effectively increase our vehicle costs, adversely affect our profitability and potentially lead to decreased borrowing base availability in our asset-backed and certain asset-based vehicle financing facilities due to the credit enhancement requirements for such facilities, which could increase if market values for vehicles decrease below net book values for those vehicles. In addition, if disposal of vehicles in the used vehicle marketplace were to become severely limited at a time when required collateral levels were rising and as a result we failed to meet the minimum required collateral levels, the principal under our asset-backed and certain asset-based financing arrangements may be required to be repaid sooner than anticipated with vehicle disposition proceeds and lease payments we make to our special purpose financing subsidiaries. If that were to occur, the holders of our asset-backed and certain asset-based debt may have the ability to exercise their right to direct the trustee or other secured party to foreclose on and sell vehicles to generate proceeds sufficient to repay such debt. We experienced these events in the first half of 2020 resulting in our financial performance being materially affected.\nThe occurrence of certain events, including those described above, resulted in the occurrence of an amortization event pursuant to which the proceeds of sales of vehicles that collateralize the affected asset-backed financing arrangement were required to be applied to the payment of principal and interest on the affected facility or series. In the case of our asset-backed financing arrangements, certain other events, including defaults by us and our affiliates in the performance of covenants set forth in the agreements governing certain vehicle debt, could result in the occurrence of a liquidation event with the passing of time or immediately pursuant to which the trustee or holders of the affected asset-backed financing arrangement would be permitted to require the sale of the assets collateralizing that series. Failure by us to have proper financing and debt management processes may result in cash shortfalls and liquidity problems, emergency financing at high interest rates, violations of debt covenants, an inability to execute strategic initiatives, which may affect our liquidity and our ability to maintain sufficient levels of revenue earning vehicles to meet customer demands and could trigger cross-defaults under certain of our other financing arrangements.\nSubstantially all of our consolidated assets secure certain of our outstanding indebtedness, which could materially adversely affect our debt and equity holders and our business.\nSubstantially all of our consolidated assets, including our revenue earning vehicles and Donlen\u2019s lease portfolio, are subject to security interests or are otherwise encumbered for the lenders under our senior credit facilities, asset-backed and asset-based financing arrangements. As a result, the lenders under those facilities have a prior claim on such assets in the Chapter 11 Cases and we may not have sufficient funds to pay in full, or at all, all of our creditors or make any amount available to holders of our equity. The same is true with respect to structurally senior obligations: in general, all liabilities and other obligations of a subsidiary must be satisfied before the assets of such subsidiary can be made available to the creditors (or equity holders) of the parent entity.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nBecause substantially all of our assets are encumbered under financing arrangements, our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial flexibility and force us to attempt to incur additional unsecured indebtedness, which may not be available to us.\nWe may not be able to deduct certain business interest expenses, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company.\nThe future limitations on the deductibility of business interest expense under Section 163(j), which was significantly modified by the TCJA and then temporarily modified by the CARES Act, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and liquidity. Section 163(j) limits the deduction for business interest expense for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 to the sum of (i) the taxpayer\u2019s business interest income, (ii) 30% of the taxpayer\u2019s adjusted taxable income (\"ATI\") and (iii) the taxpayer\u2019s floor plan financing interest. The CARES Act adjusted the ATI limitation to 50% for tax years beginning in 2019 and 2020. On July 28, 2020, the U.S. Treasury Department released final regulations with guidance on applying the limitations on the deductibility of business interest expense under Section 163(j), which included the ability to add back all tax depreciation, amortization or depletion incurred in the tax year, regardless of whether it is deducted or capitalized into inventory under Section 263A and recovered through cost of goods sold. Further limitations on the deductibility of interest on indebtedness may also result from adverse determination that debt instruments should be treated as equity for tax purposes. The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development has issued various articles generally aimed at combating what they believe is tax avoidance. Numerous jurisdictions in which we operate have been influenced by these articles as well as other factors and are increasingly active in evaluating changes to their tax laws, which may under certain fact patterns result in changes to the classification of debt instruments as equity and/or result in limitations on our ability to deduct interest expense impacting our cash tax and effective tax rate position.\nWe may not be able to raise additional capital to meet our liquidity needs, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company.\nIn connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, the Company entered into the DIP Credit Agreement, which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court on October 29, 2020. Until it emerges from Bankruptcy Court protection, the Company expects that proceeds of the DIP Credit Agreement, together with cash on hand, cash flow from operations and payments received from special purpose subsidiaries and vehicle financings, if any, will be the Company\u2019s primary source of capital to fund ongoing operations, its subordinated investments needed to support its equity interests in vehicle financings and any other capital needs and that it will have limited, if any, access to additional corporate financing and/or vehicle financings). In the event that cash on hand, cash flow from operations, payments received from special purpose subsidiaries and vehicle financings, and availability under the DIP Credit Agreement are not sufficient to meet these liquidity needs, the Company may be required to seek additional financing, and can provide no assurance that additional financing would be available or, if available, offered on acceptable terms. The amount of any such additional financing also could be limited by negative covenants in the DIP Credit Agreement, which include restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness and create liens on assets. Further, the DIP Credit Agreement contains numerous events of default. If any event of default occurs and is continuing, subject to any applicable cure period set forth in the DIP Credit Agreement, the agent and/or lenders under the DIP Credit Agreement may seek to exercise rights and remedies, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company and its Chapter 11 Cases.\nIn addition, on November 24, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the Company to enter into a new asset-based securitization facility totaling $4 billion (the \u201c2021 Fleet Financing\u201d). Together with the up to $1 billion available for fleet financing under the DIP Credit Agreement, and subject to the terms of the 2021 Fleet Financing documents and the DIP Credit Agreement, the 2021 Fleet Financing afforded the Company access to up to $5 billion in total funding to support its 2021 fleet financing needs. To the extent that such amount proves inadequate, the Company may be required to seek additional financing, and can provide no assurance that additional financing would be available or, if available, offered on acceptable terms.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nAn increase in interest rates or in our borrowing margin would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability.\nA significant portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at floating rates. As a result, to the extent we have not hedged against rising interest rates, an increase in the applicable benchmark interest rates would increase our cost of servicing our debt and could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nIn addition, we regularly refinance our indebtedness. If interest rates or our borrowing margins increase between the time an existing financing arrangement was consummated and the time such financing arrangement is refinanced, the cost of servicing our debt would increase and our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nThe interest rates of certain of our financing instruments are priced using a spread over LIBOR.\nThe London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. We typically use LIBOR as a reference rate in various of our financing transactions such that the interest due to the creditors pursuant to such financing transactions is calculated using LIBOR. Our term loan agreement also contains a stated minimum floor value for LIBOR.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist, or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021 or if replacement conventions will be developed. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities (\u201cSOFR\u201d). SOFR is observed and backward-looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. As such, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. At this time, due to a lack of consensus as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on our liquidity. However, if LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate certain of our financing agreements that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. As of December 31, 2020, we had $5.0 billion in outstanding indebtedness tied to LIBOR. Additionally, these changes may have an impact on the value of or interest earned on any LIBOR-based marketable securities, fleet leases, loans and derivatives that are included in our financial assets and liabilities.\nAn impairment of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets could have a material impact to our results of operation.\nOn an annual basis as of October 1, and at interim periods when circumstances require as a result of a triggering event, we test the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets by performing an impairment analysis. An impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value as determined using level 3 inputs under the GAAP fair value hierarchy. The reviews of fair value involve judgment and estimates, including projected revenues, royalty rates and discount rates. A significant decline in either projected revenues, projected cash flows or the weighted average cost of capital used to determine fair value could result in a material impairment charge. For details of the impairment charges incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020, see Note 5, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this 2020 Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nRISKS RELATING TO HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. COMMON STOCK\nOur common stock has been delisted from trading on the NYSE, which may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock and our stockholders.\nOn October 29, 2020, Hertz Global received notification from the NYSE that Hertz Global's common stock is no longer suitable for listing on the NYSE and that the NYSE suspended trading in Hertz Global's common stock after the market close on October 29, 2020. Although Hertz Global's common stock is deregistered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, Hertz Global's common stock remains registered under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. As a result of the delisting, Hertz Global's common stock began trading exclusively on the over-the-counter market on October 30, 2020 under the symbol HTZGQ. Delisting our common stock from the NYSE may adversely impact its liquidity, impair our stockholders\u2019 ability to buy and sell our common stock, impair our ability to raise capital, and the market price of our common stock could decrease. Delisting our common stock could also adversely impact the perception of our financial condition and have additional negative ramifications, including further loss of confidence by our employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business opportunities.\nOur post-bankruptcy capital structure is yet to be determined, and any changes to our capital structure may have a material adverse effect on existing debt and security holders.\nOur post-bankruptcy capital structure has yet to be determined and will likely be set pursuant to a Chapter 11 plan that requires Bankruptcy Court approval. The reorganization of our capital structure may include exchanges of new debt or equity securities for our existing debt, equity securities, and claims against us. Such new debt may be issued at interest rates, payment schedules and maturities different than our existing debt securities. Existing equity securities are subject to a high risk of being cancelled. The success of a reorganization through any such exchanges or modifications will depend on approval by the Bankruptcy Court and the willingness of sufficient numbers of existing debt and security holders holding sufficient amounts of debt to agree to the exchange or modification, subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, and there can be no guarantee of success. If such exchanges or modifications are successful, holders of our debt or of other claims against us may find their holdings no longer have any value or are materially reduced in value, or they may be converted to equity and be diluted or may be modified or replaced by debt with a principal amount that is less than the outstanding principal amount, longer maturities and reduced interest rates. Holders of our common stock may also find that their holdings no longer have any value and face highly uncertain or no recoveries under a plan. There can be no assurance that any new debt or equity securities will maintain their value at the time of issuance. If existing debt or equity holders are adversely affected by a reorganization, it may adversely affect our ability to issue new debt or equity in the future. Although we cannot predict how the claims and interests of stakeholders in the Chapter 11 Cases, including holders of common stock, will ultimately be resolved, we expect that common stock holders will not receive a recovery through any Chapter 11 plan unless the holders of more senior claims and interests, such as secured and unsecured indebtedness (which indebtedness is currently trading at a significant discount), are paid in full. Consequently, there is a significant risk that the holders of our common stock would receive no recovery in the Chapter 11 Cases and that our common stock will be worthless.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined Exchange Rules 13a-15(f). See Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures\" in this 2020 Annual Report for a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. As a result of the material weakness, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020. The assessment was based on criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). We are actively engaged in remediation activities designed to address the material weakness, but our remediation efforts are not complete and are ongoing. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, it may materially adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner. If we are unable to report our results in a timely and accurate manner, we may not be\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nable to comply with the applicable covenants in our financing arrangements, and may be required to seek additional waivers or repay amounts under these financing arrangements earlier than anticipated, which could adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. Although we continually review and evaluate internal control systems to allow management to report on the sufficiency of our internal controls, we cannot assure you that we will not discover additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. In 2021 when we next evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, if we identify one or more new material weaknesses or are unable to timely remediate our existing material weakness, we may be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and possibly impact our ability to obtain future financing on acceptable terms. Refer to Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures,\" for further details.\nHertz Holdings is a holding company with no operations of its own and depends on its subsidiaries for cash.\nThe operations of Hertz Holdings are conducted nearly entirely through its subsidiaries and its ability to generate cash to meet its debt service obligations or to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries via dividends or intercompany loans. However, none of the subsidiaries of Hertz Holdings are obligated to make funds available to Hertz Holdings for the payment of dividends or the service of its debt. In 2020 and as a result of COVID-19 and our inability to generate cash from its subsidiaries, Hertz Holdings filed for bankruptcy and is in the process of restructuring, In addition, certain states' laws and the terms of certain of our debt agreements significantly restrict, or prohibit, the ability of Hertz and its subsidiaries to pay dividends, make loans or otherwise transfer assets to Hertz Holdings, including state laws that require dividends to be paid only from surplus. If Hertz Holdings does not receive cash from its subsidiaries, then Hertz Holdings' financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nOur global business requires a compliance program to promote organizational adherence to applicable laws and regulations.\nWe have a compliance program designed to (i) identify applicable anti-bribery requirements (e.g., laws limiting commercial bribery and corruption), (ii) identify applicable anti-trust requirements (e.g., laws to prevent price fixing, contract rigging, market or customer allocations, etc.), (iii) interpret the application of such requirements, (iv) educate target audiences and (v) provide independent, ongoing compliance monitoring.\nOur operations in many different countries increases the risk of a violation, or alleged violation, of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, other applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations, the economic sanction programs administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the anti-boycott regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Office of Anti-Boycott Compliance. The failure of our program to operate as designed can result in a failure to comply with applicable laws, which could result in significant penalties or otherwise harm the Company\u2019s reputation and business. There can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents will comply with the Company\u2019s policies that mandate compliance with these laws. Violations of these laws could result in legal and regulatory sanctions, increased litigation and fines, prolonged negative publicity, diminished investor confidence, declining employee morale and other unfavorable consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nThe misuse or theft of information we possess, including as a result of cyber security breaches, could harm our brand, reputation or competitive position and give rise to material liabilities which may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe regularly possess, process and store non-public information about millions of individuals and businesses, including both credit and debit card information and other sensitive and confidential personal information in the normal course of our business. In addition, our customers regularly transmit sensitive and confidential information to\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nus via the internet and through other electronic means. Despite the security measures and compliance programs we currently maintain and monitor, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our facilities or systems, or those of third- parties with whom we do business, through fraud, misrepresentation, or other forms of deception. Many of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, including viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, are difficult to anticipate until launched against a target and we may be unable to implement adequate preventative measures. Our failure to have a comprehensive privacy program, whether as the result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others, could result in regulatory fines and sanctions, increased litigation, prolonged negative publicity, data breaches, declining customer confidence, loss of key customers, employee liability, shareholder derivative lawsuits and other unfavorable consequences. For example, in recent years many companies have been subject to high-profile security breaches that involved sophisticated and targeted attacks on the company\u2019s infrastructure and the compromise of non-public sensitive and confidential information. These attacks were often not recognized or detected until after the disclosure of sensitive information notwithstanding the preventive and anticipative measures the companies had maintained.\nCyber security threats in our business environment expose us to risks.\nWe encounter continuous exposure to cyber-attacks and other security threats to our information networks and systems and the information stored on those networks and systems. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-services attacks and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the availability, confidentiality and integrity or information. Cyber-attacks could also include phishing attempts or other methods to cause payments or information to be transmitted to an unintended recipient. Although we have implemented controls, policies and procedures designed to protect against, detect and mitigate these threats, at considerable cost, we face evolving and persistent attacks on our information infrastructure. The attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology assets are becoming more diverse and sophisticated. We monitor our obligations under and compliance with global laws requiring information security safeguards and notification in the event of a security breach, including the European Union's Global Data Protection Regulation (the \"GDPR\") and United States breach notification laws. We respond to potential security issues by utilizing procedures that provide for controls on detecting and addressing cyber security threats and communicating information to senior personnel and security representatives that we retain. We have also taken steps to address cyber security threats at third-parties that handle, possess, process and store our information to mitigate the potential risk to us. Such measures include contractually requiring the third-parties to maintain certain data security controls. However, because of the rapidly changing nature and sophistication of these security threats, which can be difficult to detect, there can be no assurance that our controls, policies and procedures have or will detect or prevent all of these threats, and we cannot predict the full impact of any such past or future incident. Any failure by us to effectively address, enforce and maintain our information technology infrastructure and cyber security requirements may result in substantial harm to our business, including major disruptions to business operations, loss of intellectual property, release of confidential information, malicious corruption of data, regulatory intervention and sanctions or fines, investigation and remediation costs and possible prolonged negative publicity. Although we maintain insurance coverage to address cyber security events that we believe is adequate for our business, there can be no assurance that such insurance will cover substantially all of our potential costs and expenses related to cyber security incidents that may happen in the future. In addition, privacy laws in the U.S., including the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\"), which went into effect on July 1, 2020, increasingly provide for private rights of action, with high statutory damages in the event of certain security breaches, which could increase our potential liability in the event that our information is impacted by a cyber security incident.\nWe may face particular data protection, data security and privacy risks in connection with the European Union's Global Data Protection Regulation and other privacy regulations.\nStrict data privacy laws regulating the collection, transmission, storage and use of employee data and consumers\u2019 personally-identifying information are evolving in the European Union, U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate. The GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes compliance obligations for the collection, use, retention, security, processing, transfer and deletion of personally identifiable information of individuals and\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n(DEBTORS-IN-POSSESSION)\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\ncreates enhanced rights for individuals. Additionally, the CCPA expands the definition of personal information and grants, among other things, individual rights to access and delete personal information, and the right to opt out of the sale of personal information.\nThese changes in the legal and regulatory environments in the areas of customer and employee privacy, data security, and cross-border data flows could have a material adverse effect on our business, primarily through the impairment of our marketing and transaction processing activities, the limitation on the types of information that we may collect, process and retain, the resulting costs of complying with such legal and regulatory requirements and potential monetary forfeitures and penalties for noncompliance.\nWe actively monitor compliance with data protection and privacy-related laws, including with the GDPR, CCPA and upcoming legislation (in the United States and abroad), however, these laws vary depending on the jurisdiction and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Such regulations may increase our compliance and administrative burden significantly and may require us to invest resources and management attention in order to update our IT systems to meet the new requirements. It is possible that we could encounter significant liability for failing to comply with any such requirements.\nMaintaining effective employee retention and talent management is critical to our success.\nWe develop and maintain a talent management strategy that defines current and future talent requirements (e.g., experience, skills, location requirements, timing, etc.) based on our strategic direction, coordinated recruiting and development plans across businesses and regions and considers employee mobility, centers of excellence and shared service concepts to optimize resource plans and leverage labor arbitrage. The consequences that may result from a failure of our employee retention and talent management can include inadequate staffing levels, inability to support bankruptcy and emergence strategy, lack of key talent, declining product quality and competitive differentiation, eroding employee morale and productivity, or an inability to meet/maintain internal control, regulatory or other compliance-related requirements.\nWe could face a significant withdrawal liability if we withdraw from participation in multiemployer pension plans or in the event other employers in such plans become insolvent and certain multiemployer plans in which we participate are reported to have underfunded liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows.\nWe could face a significant withdrawal liability if we withdraw from participation in one or more multiemployer pension plans or in the event other employers in such plans become insolvent, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows.\nWe participate in various \u201cmultiemployer\u201d pension plans. In the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans, then applicable law could require us to make an additional lump-sum contribution to the plan, and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statements of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan\u2019s funding of vested benefits. Our multiemployer plans could have significant underfunded liabilities. Such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability. In addition, such underfunding may increase as a result of lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. See Note 8, \"Employee Retirement Benefits,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this 2020 Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \u2018\u2018Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nWe are subject to many different forms of taxation in various jurisdictions throughout the world, which could lead to disagreements with tax authorities regarding the application of tax laws.\nIn accordance with Section 482 and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines, we have established transfer pricing policies to govern our intercompany operations.

Tax law and administration are extremely complex and often require us, together with our advisors, to make subjective determinations.\nIn addition, our estimate of tax related assets, liabilities, recoveries and expenses may incorporate significant assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the tax laws in various jurisdictions, the effect of tax treaties between jurisdictions, transfer pricing policies, taxable income projections, and the benefits of various restructuring plans. To the extent that such assumptions differ from actual results, we may have to record additional income tax expenses and liabilities.\nThe tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business might not agree with the determinations that we make with our advisors with respect to the application of tax law. Such disagreements could result in lengthy legal disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of substantial funds to the government authorities of foreign and local jurisdictions where we carry on business which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 91575, "SIC": 7510, "TIC": "HTZ"}
