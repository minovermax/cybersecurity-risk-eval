{"cik": "1407038", "company": "BG Medicine, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us. If any of the following risks actually occur, they may materially harm our business, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position\nWe need immediate additional funding to continue our operations and support our capital expenditures, which may not be available to us. Without modifications to our existing payment obligations or receipt of additional funding, our existing cash and other sources of liquidity may only be sufficient to fund our limited operations through May 2015. If additional capital is not available, we may have to further curtail our operations, or take other actions that could adversely impact our shareholders.\nOur business does not generate the cash necessary to finance our operations and has consumed substantial amounts of cash to date. We incurred net losses of $15.8 million in 2013 and $8.1 million in 2014. We expect to continue to incur losses and use cash during 2015 and beyond. Our cash utilization generally depends on the progress of our development and commercialization efforts for our cardiovascular diagnostic tests, as well as the cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory submissions for our tests and the progress of our partners for the automated versions of our tests, among several other factors.\nWithout modifications to our existing payment obligations or receipt of additional funding, we will require additional capital to continue our operations beyond May 2015. At December 31, 2014, we had cash totaling $4.1 million and an outstanding balance of $3.0 million under our secured term loan facility. At March 27, 2015, we had cash totaling $1.7 million and an outstanding balance of $1.9 million under the term loan facility having made payments totaling $1.1 million during the first three months of 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred a net loss totaling $8.1 million and used cash in operating activities totaling $8.2 million.\nOur near-term capital needs depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to carefully manage our costs;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of revenue received from sales of our galectin-3 test on Abbott\u2019s automated platform;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain compliance with the covenants of our term loan with GE Capital;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain the listing of our common stock on, and regain compliance with, the listing standards of, the NASDAQ Capital Market; and\n\u2022\nour success in promptly establishing a strategic alternative that is in our shareholders\u2019 best interests.\nAs of the date of this report and since September 11, 2014, we have implemented a reduction of approximately 68% of our workforce, or 15 people, leaving seven employees. We took these steps in order to reduce its operating expenses and extend its cash runway in anticipation of the commercial launch of automated versions of the Company\u2019s galectin-3 test.\nOn November 13, 2014, we announced that we retained Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, an investment banking firm, to assist us in reviewing and evaluating a full range of strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. The strategic alternatives could include possible joint ventures, strategic partnerships or alliances, a merger or sale of the Company or other possible transactions. There is no assurance, however, that we will be able to raise sufficient capital or engage in any strategic transaction on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate financing or engage in a strategic transaction on acceptable terms when needed, we will be required to implement further cost reduction strategies. These reductions would significantly impact activities related to the commercialization of the BGM Galectin-3 Test and the development of additional indications for the BGM Galectin-3 Test and other pipeline products, and would result in significant harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, these reductions would cause us to further curtail our operations, or take other actions that would adversely impact our shareholders.\nThere is substantial doubt concerning our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We expect to incur further losses in the commercialization of our cardiovascular diagnostic test and the operations of our business and have been dependent on funding our operations through the issuance and sale of equity securities. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result of this uncertainty and the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as of December 31, 2014, the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm included immediately prior to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes a going concern explanatory paragraph. Management\u2019s plans include focusing on increasing revenue by seeking new arrangements with commercial distribution partners and the reduction of expenditures. However, no assurance can be given at this time as to whether we will be able to achieve these objectives. Our financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nOur term loan facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that impose significant restrictions on our business and financing activities. If we default on our obligations, whether due to events beyond our control or otherwise, the lenders would have a right to foreclose on substantially all of our assets. A default could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.\nIn February 2012, as amended in May 2013, we entered into a term loan facility with General Electric Capital Corporation and Comerica Bank, or the lenders. At December 31, 2014, we have an outstanding balance of $3.0 million under the term loan facility and we are required to repay the principal monthly through maturity in August 2015. As security for our obligations under the term loan facility, we granted the lenders a lien in substantially all of our assets, other than our intellectual property, for which we have provided a negative pledge to the lenders. The term loan facility contains several affirmative and negative covenants that impose significant restrictions on our business and operations. Among others, these covenants limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness; grant liens; merge or consolidate with another entity; dispose of our business or certain assets; change our business; make certain investments or declare dividends; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; encumber our intellectual property; or repurchase stock.\nOur failure to comply with these covenants may result in the declaration of an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could cause all amounts outstanding under the term loan facility to become due and payable immediately and could cause the lenders to foreclose on the collateral securing the indebtedness, including our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. If an event of default occurs, we may not be able to cure it within any applicable cure period, if at all. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available for repayment or we may not have the ability to borrow or obtain sufficient funds to replace the accelerated indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the term loan facility may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in, expand or pursue our business activities. It may also prevent us from engaging in activities that could be beneficial to our business and our stockholders unless we repay the outstanding debt, which may not be desirable or possible.\nThe impact and results of our exploration of strategic alternatives are uncertain and may not be successful.\nOn November 13, 2014, we announced that we initiated a process to explore and consider a full range of strategic alternatives available to us to enhance shareholder value. Strategic alternatives could include possible joint ventures, strategic partnerships or alliances, a merger or sale of the Company or other possible transactions. We engaged Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated as our financial advisor to assist us in this process. There can be no assurance that this exploration process will result in any initiatives, agreements or transactions that will enhance shareholder value. Further, any strategic transaction that is completed ultimately may not deliver the anticipated benefits or enhance shareholder value.\nIn addition, there is uncertainty regarding the length and/or complexity of the strategic-alternative exploration process. We also expect that the process will continue to distract the attention of our management from operating and growing our business and may impair our relationships with our customers, partners and employees. It is also possible that we will incur significant expenses pursuing one or more transactions unsuccessfully. We do not currently intend to disclose further developments with respect to this process, unless and until our board of directors approves a specific transaction or otherwise concludes its review of strategic alternatives.\nDue in part to our limited financial resources, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable indications for our product candidates, and/or we may be unable to pursue the indications that we would like to pursue.\nWe have limited technical, managerial and financial resources to determine the indications on which we should focus the development efforts related to our product candidates. Due to our limited available financial resources and staffing, we have had to curtail development programs for our CardioSCORE test and certain additional indications for our galectin-3 test and activities that might otherwise have led to more rapid progress of our product candidates through the regulatory and development processes.\nFurthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain or regain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish. The decisions to allocate our research, management and financial resources toward particular indications for our product candidates may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better opportunities. Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate certain development programs may also cause us to miss valuable opportunities.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Strategy\nWe are an early stage commercial company with a history of losses resulting from our research and development and early commercialization efforts, we expect to incur losses for at least the next several years, and we may never achieve profitability.\nWe have incurred substantial net losses since our inception in February 2000. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we incurred net losses of $8.1 million, $15.8 million and $23.8 million, respectively. Our accumulated deficit was approximately $161.0 million at December 31, 2014. We expect to continue to incur net losses for 2015 and beyond.\nHistorically, we have generated limited revenue from our biomarker discovery and analysis services agreements. We are in the process of commercializing our first product and, to date, have generated a limited amount of product revenue. Our BGM Galectin-3 Test, received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in late 2010 as an aid in assessing the prognosis of patients suffering from chronic heart failure, and is commercially available in the United States. Our BGM Galectin-3 Test is also available in Europe under a CE Mark as an aid in assessing the prognosis of acute and chronic heart failure and as an aid in identifying individuals in the general population who are risk of developing heart failure. Automated tests for galectin-3 developed by Abbott and bioMerieux are available in Europe under a CE Mark as an aid in assessing the prognosis of chronic heart failure. The Abbott ARCHITECT automated galectin-3 test received 510(k) clearance from the FDA on December 23, 2014 as an aid in assessing the prognosis of chronic heart failure. Our BGM Galectin-3 Test is being marketed in the United States through specialty, national, regional and hospital laboratories. We will need to generate significant product revenue to achieve profitability. Even as we seek to increase our sales of our BGM Galectin-3 Test, launch automated versions of our galectin-3 test, and launch future pipeline products, we expect our losses to continue as a result of our increased manufacturing, sales and marketing, and ongoing research and development expenses. These losses, among other things, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our working capital, total assets and stockholders\u2019 equity. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our product development and commercialization efforts, we are\nunable to predict when we will become profitable, and we may never become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we are unable to achieve and then maintain profitability, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be negatively affected and the market value of our common stock will decline.\nIf we are unsuccessful in the execution of our commercial strategy, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be materially adversely affected.\nWe have implemented a commercial strategy that is intended to generate revenues through the widespread market adoption of our BGM Galectin-3 Test, automated galectin-3 testing and our future pipeline products. In support of this strategy, we support clinical research studies that have been designed to provide evidence of the clinical utility of our products, to further differentiate our products and to otherwise support the commercial introduction of our BGM Galectin-3 Test, automated galectin-3 testing and future products in our pipeline. We are unable to give any assurance that we will be successful in executing our commercial strategy or that we will be successful in providing evidence of clinical utility of our products, differentiating our products or otherwise supporting our products in the manner, timeframe or under the cost parameters we anticipate, if at all. Even if we execute this strategy as planned, we may not yield the increased revenues and market growth that we anticipate. Our failure to be commercially successful in implementing our new commercialization strategy would materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize novel diagnostic tests. If we fail to develop and commercialize these products, we may be unable to execute our business plan.\nHistorically, we have generated revenues from initiatives, collaborations and biomarker discovery and analysis services agreements with pharmaceutical companies and health care organizations. Our current business strategy, however, focuses on developing and commercializing diagnostic tests that incorporate biomarkers that we in-license and/or identify through data mining and outsourced laboratory analysis of specific patient cohorts and specimen repositories. Beginning in November 2012, we have shifted our focus from early stage biomarker discovery toward a more commercially-oriented role in which we generate and support studies that have been designed to provide evidence of clinical utility, further differentiate and support the BGM Galectin-3 Test and future products in our pipeline. Beginning in 2015, our commercial strategy will increasingly rely on the success of our automated partners to commercialize automated versions of the galectin-3 test. We do not expect to receive future revenue from performing biomarker discovery and analysis services for third parties. The success of our business will depend on our ability to develop and commercialize diagnostic tests based on the products in our current pipeline, as well as others that we may in-license in the future, and the ability of our automated partners to commercialize automated versions of our galectin-3 test.\nPrior to commercializing our diagnostic tests, we are required to undertake time-consuming and costly development activities, sometimes including clinical studies, and to obtain regulatory clearance or approval, for which the outcome is uncertain. We have limited experience in developing and commercializing diagnostic tests and there are considerable risks involved in these activities. The science and methods that we are employing are innovative and complex, and it is possible that our product development programs will ultimately not yield diagnostic tests for commercialization. Products that appear promising in early development may fail to be validated in subsequent studies, and even if we achieve positive results, we may still fail to obtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals. Few research and development projects result in commercial products, and perceived viability in early clinical studies often is not replicated in later studies. At any point, we may abandon development of a product candidate, or we may be required to expend considerable resources obtaining additional clinical and nonclinical data, which would adversely impact the timing for generating potential revenue from those product candidates. If our development programs yield fewer commercial products than we expect, we may be unable to execute our business plan, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe expect that our commercial strategy will increasingly rely on the success of our automated partners to develop and commercialize automated versions of the galectin-3 test. If our automated partners fail to perform or prioritize their collaborations or terminate their agreements with us, our ability to substantially increase customer acceptance and clinical adoption of our galectin-3 test will be undermined.\nAlthough, to date, the micro-titer plate version of the BGM Galectin-3 Test has been the primary focus of our commercialization strategy, we believe that the introduction of automated testing for galectin-3 will improve access to testing, shorten turn-around time to receive testing data, minimize objections related to the more labor intensive micro-titer plate testing method and, as a result, accelerate adoption of galectin-3 testing. To this end, we have partnered with four leading diagnostic instrument manufacturers to develop automated versions of our galectin-3 test. We also expect that the introduction of automated testing for galectin-3 will result in broader customer acceptance and clinical adoption of galectin-3 testing because the four automated partners maintain broad access to major segments of the diagnostics market, including hospital laboratories, private laboratories, reference laboratories and physician office laboratories, due to the widespread coverage of their installed bases. On December 23, 2014, the FDA granted 510(k) clearance for Abbott Laboratories\u2019 ARCHITECT\u00ae Galectin-3 assay, the first FDA cleared automated blood test for galectin-3. We anticipate U.S. market introduction of Abbott\u2019s ARCHITECT Galectin-3 automated assay in mid-2015 and expect that our commercial strategy will increasingly rely on the success of our automated partners to develop and commercialize automated versions of the galectin-3 test. Under the agreements, our partners are responsible for developing and commercializing the tests. Accordingly, we are dependent upon our automated partners to prioritize the development of their respective automated versions and the regulatory clearance of their automated versions. Our partners may experience difficulties and delays in other segments of their businesses that may negatively impact their ability to prioritize and commercialize the automated versions of our test. Our partners\u2019 delays, failures or unwillingness to prioritize or devote adequate resources to develop and obtain regulatory clearance for the automated versions of our galectin-3 test would result in a substantially smaller market opportunity for our galectin-3 testing business and would adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe expect that our commercial strategy will increasingly rely on the success of our automated partners to develop and commercialize automated versions of the galectin-3 test. Our automated partners may be unable to develop and/or obtain regulatory clearance of galectin-3 tests that can be performed on their automated platforms.\nWe have entered into worldwide license, development and commercialization agreements with Abbott Laboratories, or Abbott, bioM\u00e9rieux SA, or bioM\u00e9rieux, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc., or Siemens, and Alere, Inc., or Alere. To date, only Abbott and bioM\u00e9rieux have launched galectin-3 tests developed for their automated platforms in Europe, under CE Mark and, on December 23, 2014, the FDA granted 510(k) clearance for Abbott Laboratories\u2019 ARCHITECT\u00ae Galectin-3 assay, the first FDA cleared automated blood test for galectin-3. We anticipate U.S. market introduction of Abbott\u2019s ARCHITECT Galectin-3 automated assay in mid-2015 and expect that our commercial strategy will increasingly rely on the success of our automated partners to develop and commercialize automated versions of the galectin-3 test. There are a variety of risks and uncertainties that may cause delays in, or prevent our automated partners from, successfully developing or obtaining CE Mark or regulatory clearance from the FDA for automated versions of our galectin-3 test in the timeframes we expect, or at all. Delays may result from unanticipated problems in product development, an inability to obtain regulatory clearance or approval on a timely basis. Any material delays in our partners\u2019 receipt of regulatory clearance or approval for the automated versions of our galectin-3 test, or their failure to obtain such clearances or approvals at all, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect that our commercial strategy will increasingly rely on the success of our automated partners to develop and commercialize automated versions of the galectin-3 test. Our automated partners may be unable or decide not to commercialize automated galectin-3 tests.\nWe have entered into worldwide license, development and commercialization agreements with Abbott, bioM\u00e9rieux, Siemens and Alere. To date, only bioM\u00e9rieux and Abbott have launched galectin-3 tests developed\nfor their automated platforms in Europe, under CE Mark and, on December 23, 2014, the FDA granted 510(k) clearance for Abbott Laboratories\u2019 ARCHITECT\u00ae Galectin-3 assay, the first FDA cleared automated blood test for galectin-3. We anticipate U.S. market introduction of Abbott\u2019s ARCHITECT Galectin-3 automated assay mid-2015. Since launching in 2013, revenues from the sale of automated galectin-3 tests developed for these platforms have, thus far, been limited. While we intend to leverage the commercial capabilities of our automated partners to promote the utility of our tests to clinicians, laboratory decision makers, payers, patients and other stakeholders, even if we are able to implement this strategy, we will be largely dependent on these third parties for the commercial success of our products. They may not deploy the resources we would like them to, and our revenue would then suffer. In addition, we could become embroiled in disputes with these parties regarding the terms of any agreements, their performance or intellectual property rights. Any dispute could disrupt the sales of our products and adversely affect our reputation and revenue. Failure of our strategy to leverage the expertise, marketing resources and installed base of our automated partners would have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe royalty provisions in the agreements with our partners for the automated versions of our galectin-3 test are subject to renegotiation and following renegotiation, the royalties payable to us may not be favorable to us.\nThe agreements we entered into with our partners who are developing and commercializing the automated versions of our galectin-3 test contain provisions that, under certain circumstances, entitle our partners to reduce the royalty amounts payable to us on the sales of their tests in amounts that are subject to negotiation by us and our respective partners. In some cases, our partners\u2019 rights to reduce the royalty amounts are triggered by the CMS payment rate being below certain agreed-upon thresholds and in other cases, our partners\u2019 rights to reduce the royalty amounts payable to us are triggered by the average selling prices for the tests in certain regions being below certain agreed-upon price thresholds. Effective January 1, 2014 the payment rate at which our BGM Galectin-3 Test is reimbursed by CMS was increased to $30.01 from $17.80 per test. In 2015, national limitation amount for our BGM Galectin-3 Test was reduced to $29.93 and applies across the U.S., except in Ohio and West Virginia where rates of $23.93 and $26.33, respectively, apply. Even with the increase from 2013, the CMS payment rate for calendar years 2014 and 2015 are below the agreed-upon CMS payment rate thresholds in the agreements with our automated partners. Accordingly, the current royalty amounts payable to us under these agreements are subject to reduction by our partners, in amounts to be negotiated by us and our respective partners. There can be no assurance that in any renegotiation of these royalty provisions we will be successful in negotiating new rates that will be favorable to us.\nWe may not be able to successfully commercialize our BGM Galectin-3 Test in the timeframes we expect, or at all.\nOur first product, the BGM Galectin-3 Test, received clearance from the FDA in late 2010 and is commercially available throughout the United States as an aid in assessing the prognosis of patients suffering from chronic heart failure. In Europe, our BGM Galectin-3 Test is commercially available under a CE Mark as an aid in assessing the prognosis of patients suffering from acute and chronic heart failure and as an aid in identifying individuals in the general population who are at risk of developing heart failure. In the United States, our BGM Galectin-3 Test kits are purchased by clinical, hospital and reference laboratories, clinical research organizations and pharmaceutical manufacturers. In Europe, our BGM Galectin-3 Test kits are purchased by independent sales distributors, hospital and research laboratories, clinical research organizations and pharmaceutical manufacturers. We are unable to give any assurance that we will be successful in generating revenues from adoption of the BGM Galectin-3 Test. Even if we are successful in generating revenue from the sale of the BGM Galectin-3 Test, we may not generate the increased revenues and market growth that we anticipate. Our failure to generate revenue from the sale of the BGM Galectin-3 Test would materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn pursuing our commercialization strategy for our BGM Galectin-3 Test for heart failure, we are particularly dependent upon Health Diagnostic Laboratory, Inc., or HDL, which was responsible for approximately 80% of our galectin-3 sales in 2014. Any disruption in HDL\u2019s operations or problems that otherwise adversely affect our business relationship with HDL could result in a delay or interruption of the sales volume of our galectin-3 test.\nIn pursuing our commercialization strategy for our BGM Galectin-3 Test for heart failure, we are particularly dependent upon HDL, which was responsible for approximately 80% of our galectin-3 test sales in 2014. In March 2011, we entered into a supply agreement with HDL pursuant to which HDL agreed to make our microplate galectin-3 test available to physicians in the United States. Under the agreement, we agreed to provide HDL with certain clinical market development resources, programs and assistance as reasonably requested by HDL, and HDL agreed to perform certain sales, marketing and marketing education activities in support of our galectin-3 test. Accordingly, we may suffer significant losses as a result of any business interruptions experienced by HDL or if our relationship with HDL is otherwise adversely affected. Any prolonged disruption in HDL\u2019s operations or problems that otherwise undermine our business relationship with HDL could have a significant negative impact on our ability to execute on our commercialization strategy for our galectin-3 test in the United States and to maintain or increase the sales volume of our galectin-3 test.\nPurchases of BGM Galectin-3 Test kits made by research laboratories, clinical research organizations and pharmaceutical manufacturers who are employing the test for research purposes may fluctuate and impact sales volume of our galectin-3 test.\nThere is considerable interest in evaluating the measurement of galectin-3 as part of both heart failure and non-heart failure related preclinical and clinical research projects. Purchases of BGM Galectin-3 kits made by research laboratories, clinical research organizations and pharmaceutical manufacturers represent a potentially significant source of our revenue. However, sales related to test kit purchases made for research purposes may fluctuate significantly over time due to the fact that these purchases are typically buyer initiated, study specific and are dependent on the availability of research funding. In addition, low cost test kits containing research grade reagents that have not been cleared by regulatory authorities may be used for non-clinical testing of galectin-3 by some investigators. Accordingly, sales related to research applications of our BGM Galectin-3 Test kits may fluctuate widely over time and negatively impact on our ability to predict, maintain or increase the sales volume of our galectin-3 test.\nWe may not be able to provide evidence of clinical utility or to differentiate our BGM Galectin-3 Test through clinical research studies in the timeframes we expect, or at all.\nWe support clinical research studies performed by third party investigators that have been designed to provide evidence of the clinical utility of our BGM Galectin-3 Test and to differentiate its performance from other diagnostic products. The results of these studies are essential to our efforts to ensure customer acceptance and clinical adoption of our BGM Galectin-3 Test. The results of these studies support our efforts to promote our BGM Galectin-3 Test and to educate potential customers. We may be unable to demonstrate that our galectin-3 test provides incremental benefits over currently available heart failure diagnostic tests sufficient to ensure adoption of our test in the timeframes we expect, or at all.\nFurthermore, since we have limited technical, managerial and financial resources we may be unable to support clinical research studies that have been designed to provide evidence of the clinical utility of our BGM Galectin-3 Test and to differentiate its performance from other diagnostic products. Due to our limited technical, managerial and financial resources we have had to curtail certain clinical research activities that might otherwise have led to the development of additional evidence regarding the incremental benefits associated with galectin-3 testing.\nWe are unable to give any assurance that we will be successful in providing sufficient evidence of clinical utility of our BGM Galectin-3 Test or differentiate from other diagnostic products in the manner, timeframe or under the cost parameters we anticipate, if at all. If we are unable to provide evidence of clinical utility and differentiate\nour BGM Galectin-3 Test, we may not be able to generate the increased revenues and market growth that we anticipate. Our failure to generate revenue from the sale of the BGM Galectin-3 Test would materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may not be able to provide evidence of clinical utility or to differentiate our future pipeline products, including new indications for our BGM Galectin-3 Test and our CardioSCORE Test.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize the future pipeline products that we may develop will depend on numerous factors, including whether health care providers believe that any other diagnostic tests that we successfully develop provide sufficient incremental clinical utility; whether the medical community accepts that our diagnostic products have sufficient sensitivity, specificity and predictive value to be meaningful in patient care and treatment decisions; and whether health insurers, government health programs and other third-party payers will cover and pay for our diagnostic tests and the amount that they will reimburse. These factors may present obstacles to commercial acceptance of our diagnostic product candidates. To the extent these obstacles arise, we will need to devote substantial time and resources to overcome these obstacles, and we might not be successful. Failure to achieve widespread market acceptance of our diagnostic products would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are unable to give any assurance that we will be successful in providing sufficient evidence of clinical utility or any assurance that we will have adequate managerial, technical or financial resources to support the studies necessary to provide sufficient evidence of clinical utility of our future products including new indications for the BGM Galectin-3 Test or differentiate from other diagnostic products in the manner, timeframe or cost parameters we anticipate, if at all. If we are unable to provide evidence of clinical utility and differentiate our future products including new indications for the BGM Galectin-3 Test, we will not be able to generate the increased revenues and market growth that we seek. Our failure to generate revenue from the sale of current or future products including the BGM Galectin-3 Test would materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may not be able to successfully commercialize our BGM Galectin-3 Test because its clinical indications for use do not generate broad enough customer acceptance.\nWe believe that the measurement of the protein biomarker galectin-3 in patients with heart failure may facilitate treatment decisions that are made regarding the intensity, locale, and nature of a heart failure patient\u2019s ongoing care. We believe that results obtained from testing with our BGM Galectin-3 Test may be used to aid in the assessment of prognosis, reduce hospital readmissions, and help identify patients who may require more intense and specialized care such as referral to a heart failure specialist, the need for advanced diagnostics and therapies, and the need for other specialized forms of monitoring. We cannot be certain that these or other indications for use will generate broad enough customer acceptance to yield the increased revenues and market growth that we seek from adoption of the BGM Galectin-3 Test. Our failure to generate sufficiently broad customer acceptance and widespread market adoption of the BGM Galectin-3 Test would materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf the marketplace does not accept our BGM Galectin-3 Test or other diagnostic products we might develop, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to sustain and grow our business.\nAlthough we believe that our BGM Galectin-3 Test and potential future pipeline products represent promising commercial opportunities, our products may never gain significant acceptance in the marketplace and therefore never generate substantial revenue or profits for us. As is the case with all novel biomarkers, we must establish markets for our diagnostic tests and build those markets through physician education and awareness programs. Our ability to market our products through physician education and awareness programs is currently limited following our recent Restructuring, which eliminated our sales and marketing organization. Publication in peer reviewed journals of results from studies using our products will be an important consideration in the adoption by\nphysicians of our products, but will be dependent on the interest of third party investigators, the execution of well-designed clinical research studies, the nature of the results generated by these studies, and the extent to which third party investigators who perform these studies make the effort to communicate and publish the results of these studies. The process of publication in leading medical journals is subject to a peer review process. Peer reviewers may not consider the results of studies of our BGM Galectin-3 Test and our future pipeline products sufficiently novel or worthy of publication. Failure to have our studies published in peer reviewed journals may adversely affect adoption of our products.\nHealth insurers and other third-party payers may decide not to reimburse our diagnostic products or may provide inadequate reimbursement, which could jeopardize our commercial prospects.\nIn the United States, the regulatory process that allows diagnostic tests to be marketed is independent of any coverage determinations made by third-party payers. For new diagnostic tests, private and government payers decide whether to cover the test, the reimbursement amount for a covered test and the specific conditions for reimbursement. Physicians may order diagnostic tests that are not reimbursed by third-party payers, but coverage determinations and reimbursement levels and conditions are critical to the commercial success of a diagnostic product.\nEach third-party payer makes its own decision about which tests it will cover and how much it will pay, although many payers will follow the lead of Medicare. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that requires us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of each of our products to each payer separately, with no assurance that approval will be obtained. If third-party payers decide not to cover our diagnostic tests or if they offer inadequate payment amounts, our ability to generate revenue from our diagnostic tests could be limited. Even if one or more third-party payers decide to reimburse for our tests, a third-party payer may stop or lower payment at any time, which could reduce revenue. We cannot predict whether third-party payers will cover our tests or offer adequate reimbursement. We also cannot predict the timing of such decisions. In addition, physicians or patients may decide not to order our tests if third-party payments are inadequate, especially if ordering the test could result in financial liability for the patient.\nIn the United States, the American Medical Association assigns specific CPT codes, which are a medical nomenclature used to report medical procedures and services under public and private health insurance plans. Once the CPT code is established, the CMS establishes reimbursement payment levels and coverage rules for Medicare, and private payers establish rates and coverage rules independently. Payment for diagnostic tests furnished to Medicare beneficiaries is made based on a fee schedule set by CMS that reflects its established reimbursement payment levels and coverage rules for Medicare.\nEffective January 1, 2014, the payment rate at which our BGM Galectin-3 Test was reimbursed by CMS was increased to $30.01 from $17.80 per test. In addition, the 2014 national limitation amount was subject to a 2% sequestration applicable to Medicare services. In 2015, the national limitation amount for our BGM Galectin-3 Test was reduced to $29.93 and applies across the U.S., except in Ohio and West Virginia where rates of $23.93 and $26.33, respectively, apply. Additionally, any or all of our diagnostic tests developed in the future may not be approved for reimbursement or may be approved at a level that limits our commercial success.\nIn 2015, the national limitation for our BGM Galectin-3 Test decreased and may decrease more, which could jeopardize our commercial prospects. Reimbursement decisions in the European Union and in other jurisdictions outside of the United States vary by country and region and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining adequate reimbursement.\nWe expect to face intense competition, often from companies with greater resources and experience than us.\nThe clinical diagnostics industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change. The industry continues to expand and evolve as an increasing number of competitors and potential competitors enter the market. Many of\nthese competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, managerial and research and development resources and experience than we do. Some of these competitors and potential competitors have more experience than we do in the development of diagnostic products, including validation procedures and regulatory matters. In addition, our diagnostic products compete with product offerings from large and well-established companies that have greater marketing and sales experience and capabilities than we do. We are aware of other diagnostic tests under development, which, if successfully developed and commercialized, would compete with our products.\nOur competitors, some of whom we collaborate with and rely on to commercialize our products, may include established diagnostics companies, such as Abbott Diagnostics, Beckman Coulter, bioM\u00e9rieux, Roche Diagnostics, General Electric, Alere, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Mitsubishi, Philips and Siemens. We may also compete with national commercial laboratories with extensive service networks for diagnostic tests, such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics. Specialized cardiovascular CLIA laboratories such as Atherotech, Berkeley Heart Lab , Bioreference Lab , Boston Heart Diagnostics , Cleveland HeartLab, HDL, Liposcience,, and Cardio DX have expanded their presence and product menu in the cardiovascular market and some have developed their own tests or panels. Companies that may compete with us in the cardiovascular diagnostics market include Athena Diagnostics, Atherotech, Berkeley Heart Lab, HDL, Bioreference Lab , Dako, diaDexus, Myriad Genetics, Singulex and Critical Diagnostics. Companies that may compete with us in the research market include R&D Systems, eBioSCience, BioVendor, DRG International, Kamiya and IBL. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may be unable to sustain and grow our revenue.\nWe are dependent on third parties for the patient samples that are essential to the development and validation of our diagnostic tests.\nTo pursue our development and validation of our diagnostic tests, we need access, over time, to thousands of patient samples, including blood, blood plasma and serum, urine and other fluids. We do not have direct access to a supply of patient samples. As a result, we have made arrangements with third parties, such as academic medical centers, government programs and payers such as Humana that have given us access to a significant number of patient samples for the development and validation of our diagnostic tests. Most of the institutions and physicians from which we obtain biological specimens that we use in our research and validation work are \u201cCovered Entities\u201d under HIPAA. Under this law, these parties may have to obtain proper authorization from their patients, de-identify samples or take some other step to permit the subsequent use of those samples and associated clinical information. We are not presently a Covered Entity or a Business Associate of a Covered Entity subject to HIPAA, but we may become a Covered Entity or a Business Associate of a Covered Entity in the future. We may lose access to patient samples provided by such third parties, or have that access limited, because the third parties decrease the number of patient samples they provide, due to changes in privacy laws governing the use and disclosure of medical information or due to changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain patient samples and associated information. In certain instances, we owe the party providing the samples for our research programs payments which may be related to the sales of products derived from those research programs. In addition, we may be forced to actively pursue patient samples from other sources for the diagnostic testing indications we pursue, which could be expensive and time consuming. If we fail to secure and maintain an adequate supply of patient samples, or if our existing supply arrangements are terminated or result in access to fewer samples than expected, our ability to pursue our development efforts may be slowed or halted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if we engage in activities that make us a covered entity for HIPAA purposes, such as electronic billing of third party payers, we will have to implement a comprehensive HIPAA compliance program. HIPAA compliance is a costly and time consuming process. Failure to comply would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on laboratory contractors for testing of patient samples that are essential to the development and validation of our diagnostic tests.\nTo pursue our development and validation of our diagnostic tests, we periodically need access to test results obtained from patient samples, including blood, blood plasma and serum, urine and other fluids. We do not operate a testing laboratory. As a result, we purchase testing services from third party laboratories, such as those associated with academic medical centers, hospitals and independent reference laboratories to preform testing on patient samples for the development and validation of our diagnostic tests. The testing laboratories are typically licensed, certified per the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) and, often, also certified by the College of American Pathologists. All specimens and associated patient information are handled according to HIPAA and other regulations associated with laboratory testing. Failure to access contracted laboratory services would have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and validate our diagnostic tests.\nRisks Related To Regulatory Approval and Other Government Regulations\nThe process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market medical devices, including in vitro diagnostic test kits, from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States can be costly and time-consuming.\nIn pursuing our strategy of commercializing our products worldwide, we face various regulatory schemes and requirements. Each regulatory agency may impose its own requirements and may refuse to grant approval or may require additional data before granting marketing approval even if marketing approval has been granted by other agencies. For example, in seeking clearance from the FDA for our galectin-3 test, we relied on samples from previously concluded studies sponsored by other parties to determine the clinical utility of our galectin-3 test, and we may do so for our other product candidates. While the FDA accepted such data in support of our galectin-3 test, and we believe it has accepted such data in other cases, the FDA may require us to conduct our own prospective studies to support future product clearances or approvals, which would make the development and validation of our product candidates more costly and time-consuming. There can be no assurance that such clearances or approvals will be granted on a timely basis or at all.\nAlthough we have received FDA clearance for our BGM Galectin-3 Test for use as an aid in assessing the prognosis of patients diagnosed with chronic heart failure, we may not obtain regulatory clearance for the additional indications we are seeking when expected, if at all.\nIn the United States, we may seek FDA clearance or approval for our products prior to their launch for clinical use, whether offered as a diagnostic kit or laboratory service. The FDA process can be lengthy and unpredictable. For example, for our first product, the BGM Galectin-3 Test for heart failure, we initially filed for premarket 510(k) notification with FDA in March 2009. Upon review of our 510(k) filing, the FDA determined that our device was not substantially equivalent to the legally marketed device to which we claimed substantial equivalence and therefore denied clearance. The FDA indicated that additional clinical and other data were required in support of our filing, and we fileded a new premarket 510(k) notification in December 2009, incorporating additional data. In February 2010, we received a letter from the FDA that requested additional clinical and statistical information to support our filing. After further contact with the FDA, we submitted our formal response to the FDA letter in August 2010. We received 510(k) clearance from the FDA in November 2010 for our BGM Galectin-3 Test as an aid in assessing the prognosis of patients diagnosed with chronic heart failure. In May 2012, we filed a premarket 510(k) notification with FDA for use of the BGM Galectin-3 Test to aid in the identification of individuals who are healthy and asymptomatic at the time of testing, but, who are at increased risk for developing heart failure in the future. In July 2012, we received a letter from the FDA regarding this 510(k) filing in which FDA requested additional information, including information regarding our analytical validation and our clinical validation study, the Framingham Heart Study. We submitted our response to the FDA in November 2012, but based on our dialogue with the FDA, the nature of the additional information requested and the time required to address the FDA\u2019s questions regarding various matters including the age of\nthe blood samples used to support our 510(k) filing, we allowed the 510(k) to expire on the January 23, 2013 deadline for submitting our response to the FDA. On March 31, 2015, we filed a premarket 510(k) notification to the FDA to obtain regulatory clearance to market our BGM Galectin-3 Test in the United States for a new indication for use, as an aid in the assessment of near-term risk of fatal cardiovascular events in older adults who have no prior history of coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, or vascular disease. There can be no assurance that we will receive 510(k) clearance from the FDA for this new indication for use. There can be no assurance as to when we may be in a position to submit additional new premarket 510(k) notifications for other indications for our galectin-3 test to the FDA, if at all.\nAlthough we have received FDA clearance for our BGM Galectin-3 Test for heart failure, our automated partners may not obtain regulatory clearance for their automated tests for galectin-3 when expected, if at all.\nWe believe that automation of our galectin-3 test will broaden its acceptance by laboratory customers and, as a result, accelerate its clinical adoption. To that end, we have entered into licensing and commercialization agreements with four leading diagnostic instrument manufacturers to develop and commercialize automated instrument versions of our galectin-3 test. Commercial introduction of the automated versions of our galectin-3 test will require FDA clearance or approval. On December 23, 2014, the FDA granted 510(k) clearance for Abbott Laboratories\u2019 (Abbott) ARCHITECT\u00ae Galectin-3 assay, the first FDA cleared automated blood test for Galectin-3. There can be no assurances that our other automated partners will be successful in gaining FDA clearance.\nChanges in regulatory review procedures, approval requirements or enactment of additional regulatory approval requirements in Europe may delay or prevent us from marketing our proposed products.\nTo market our products in Europe, we must obtain a CE Mark and may, in some cases, need marketing approval from the European Medicines Agency. In October 2009, we obtained a CE Mark in Europe for our first product, the BGM Galectin-3 Test for heart failure. In December 2012, we obtained a CE Mark in Europe for our second product, the CardioSCORE test. In addition, we have partnered with four leading diagnostic instrument manufacturers to develop automated tests for galectin-3. In January 2013, bioM\u00e9rieux obtained a CE Mark in Europe. In April 2013, Abbott obtained a CE mark for its automated version of our galectin-3 test. To date, we have found the CE Mark process to be an efficient means to obtain regularly approval, thereby, allowing for market entry for our products in Europe and in other countries that recognize CE Mark. If, however, the CE Mark process becomes more onerous, costly or time-consuming, we will need to re-evaluate our ex-U.S. commercialization strategy and invest more of our limited resources before even entering the market with our products.\nOur CardioSCORE test has not been cleared by the FDA for sale in the United States.\nWe do not currently receive significant revenue from sales of our CardioSCORE test, which currently may only be marketed in Europe and other countries that recognize CE Mark. In December 2011, we filed a premarket 510(k) notification with FDA in order to obtain regulatory clearance to market the CardioSCORE test in the United States as an aid in the assessment of near-term risk for significant cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke. In response to this filing, the FDA requested that we engage an independent committee of physicians to conduct a medical review and adjudication of clinical endpoints reported in the filing. Due to the time involved in responding to this request, we withdrew the 510(k) filing on August 8, 2012. Our medical review also included the assessment of sample stability and the evaluation of other technical issues raised by FDA. The adjudication process is now complete. While we continue to explore potential opportunities to monetize CardioSCORE, we have redirected our resources to support our development and commercialization of galectin-3 testing. Currently, we are not actively engaged in development or commercialization activities related to CardioSCORE. There can be no assurance that we will receive significant revenue from sales of our CardioSCORE test in Europe, that we will succeed in otherwise monetizing CardioSCORE, that in the future we will file premarket510(k) notification withFDA to obtain regulatory clearance to market the CardioSCORE test in the United States or that we will receive such clearance.\nOur BGM Galectin-3 Test for heart failure and any future products cleared by the FDA will be subject to ongoing regulation by the FDA. Failure to comply with such regulation could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAfter a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:\n\u2022\ncompliance with FDA\u2019s quality system regulation, or QSR;\n\u2022\nlabeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses and impose other restrictions on marketing; and\n\u2022\nmedical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:\n\u2022\nwarning letters;\n\u2022\nfines, injunctions, and civil penalties;\n\u2022\nrecall or seizure of our products;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\nrefusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMAs of new products;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of 510(k) clearance or PMAs that are already granted; and\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nBeing subject to any of these sanctions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we are successful in obtaining regulatory clearance or approval for our product candidates, we will be subject to regulations under additional federal and state laws.\nIf we develop diagnostic tests suitable for commercialization, and after receiving all necessary regulatory clearances and approvals, we will be subject to national, regional and local regulations. For example, in the United States, the regulations which we may be subject to include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its related rules, regulations, guidance documents and other interpretations relating to the manufacture and marketing of medical products;\n\u2022\nthe federal Medicare and Medicaid Anti-kickback Law, and state anti-kickback prohibitions;\n\u2022\nthe federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, and the state equivalents;\n\u2022\nHIPAA;\n\u2022\nthe various state laws governing patient privacy; and\n\u2022\nthe federal civil and criminal False Claims Act.\nThe risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations.\nAny action brought against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we prevail, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to any applicable penalty associated with the violation, including civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines. We could also be required to refund any improperly received payments, and we could be required to further curtail our operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we or our third-party manufacturer fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s quality system regulation, the development and manufacture of our products could be delayed or interrupted and our products may be subject to product recalls.\nWe and our contract manufacturers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR and other regulations which cover, among other things, the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. The FDA monitors compliance with QSR through periodic inspections. If the FDA determines that we or our contractors are not in compliance with applicable regulatory standards, we could be prevented or forced to delay the development or manufacture of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, any failure to maintain QSR compliance could force us to cease the development or manufacture of our products and subject us to other enforcement sanctions, including withdrawal of our products from the U.S. or foreign markets, and delay or interrupt the development or manufacture of additional products.\nHealth care reform measures could hinder or prevent our product candidates\u2019 commercial success.\nThe U.S. government and other governments have shown significant interest in pursuing health care reform. Any government-adopted reform measures could adversely impact the pricing of health care products, including our diagnostic products, and services in the U.S. or internationally and the amount of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or other third-party payers. The continuing efforts of the U.S. and foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payers of health care services to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to set prices we believe are fair for any diagnostic products we may develop and commercialize. Changes in health care policy, such as the creation of broad limits for diagnostic products, could substantially interrupt the sale of future diagnostic tests, increase costs, divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability.\nNew laws, regulations and judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations and decisions, relating to health care availability, methods of delivery or payment for diagnostic products and services, or sales, marketing or pricing, may limit our potential revenue, and we may need to revise our research and development or commercialization programs. The pricing and reimbursement environment may change in the future and become more challenging due to several reasons, including policies advanced by the U.S. government, new health care legislation or fiscal challenges faced by government health administration authorities. Specifically, in both the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals and initiatives to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell any diagnostic products we may develop and commercialize profitably. Some of these proposed and implemented reforms could result in reduced reimbursement rates for our diagnostic products, which would adversely affect our business strategy, operations and financial results. For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law a legislative overhaul of the U.S. health care system, known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the PPACA, which may have far reaching consequences for life science companies like us. As a result of this legislation, substantial changes could be made to the current system for paying for health care in the United States, including changes made in order to extend medical benefits to those who currently lack insurance coverage. Extending coverage to a large population could substantially change the structure of the health insurance system and the methodology for reimbursing medical services, drugs and devices. These structural changes could entail modifications to the existing system of private payers and government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, the creation of a government-sponsored health care insurance source, or some combination of both, as well as other changes. Restructuring the coverage of medical care in the United States could impact the reimbursement for prescribed drugs, biopharmaceuticals, medical devices or our product candidates. If reimbursement for our approved product candidates, if any, is substantially less that we expect in the future, or rebate obligations associated with them are substantially increased, our business could be materially and adversely impacted. In addition, certain members of Congress remain fixated on the repeal of some or all of PPACA, adding further uncertainty to the law\u2019s future impact on us.\nFurther federal and state proposals and health care reforms could limit the prices that can be charged for the product candidates that we develop and may further limit our commercial opportunity. Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the PPACA, by the Medicare prescription drug coverage legislation, by the possible effect of such current or future legislation on amounts that private insurers will pay and by other health care reforms that may be enacted or adopted in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf the combination of patents, trade secrets and contractual provisions that we rely on to protect our intellectual property proves inadequate, our ability to successfully commercialize our proposed products will be harmed and we may never be able to operate our business profitably.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect proprietary methods, discoveries and diagnostic tests that we develop under the patent and other intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries, so that we can seek to prevent others from unlawfully using our inventions and proprietary information. We rely on both patents and trade secrets to protect the proprietary aspects of our methods and discoveries. As of February 28, 2015, we have six issued U.S. patents and six pending patent applications filed with the USPTO, under the PCT or with foreign patent agencies. A portion of the intellectual property that we own or license relates to our galectin-3 test. This intellectual property includes U.S. Patent Nos. 7,888,137 and 8,084,276, exclusively licensed from ACS Biomarker B.V. and nine corresponding patent applications pending in the United States and abroad, as well as issued patents in Europe, Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong and Japan. U.S. Patent No. 7,888,137 is scheduled to expire in November 2026 and U.S. Patent No. 8,084,276 is scheduled to expire in September 2024. We own a U.S. and corresponding foreign applications relating to a specific method and kit for detecting galectin-3. Any patent issuing from this U.S. application could expire as early as 2029. In addition, we own one issued U.S. patent, one pending U.S. patent application and corresponding foreign counterparts related to methods for clinical evaluation of subjects based on galectin-3 measurements. A portion of the intellectual property that we own relates to our CardioSCORE test. This intellectual property includes U.S. Patent Application No. 12/946,470, an issued patent in Europe and two corresponding patent applications abroad and U.S. Patent Application No. 13/765,366 and two corresponding patent applications abroad. Any patent issuing from the earliest-filed U.S. application could expire as early as 2030. For the diagnostic tests that we develop based on our biomarker discoveries, we expect to rely primarily on patent protection. Several of our patent applications are in an early stage of prosecution, and we cannot assure you that any of the pending patent applications will result in patents being issued. In addition, due to technological changes that may affect our proposed products or judicial interpretation of the scope of our patents, our proposed products might not, now or in the future, be adequately covered by our patents.\nThe patentability of molecular biomarkers and of test methods and products based on biomarkers is well-established in most countries. However, the issuance of any patent, including the patents for which we have applied, and the validity of the resulting patent rights depend upon a detailed interpretation of the specific patent claims and prior art, among other considerations, and generally is highly uncertain because of the complex legal and factual considerations it involves. In recent years, the United States Supreme Court has rendered several decisions in patent cases limiting the types of inventions for which patent protection is available and in particular, for claimed inventions directed to a law of nature, a natural phenomenon, or an abstract idea (collectively, the \u201cjudicial exceptions\u201d to patent eligibility). For example, on March 20, 2012, the United States Supreme Court rendered its decision in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc., in which the Court denied patent protection for patent claims covering methods that correlate the concentration of a well-known drug metabolite to the likely harm or ineffectiveness of the drug as a means of determining proper drug dosage. At issue was whether the claimed methods transformed unpatentable laws of nature into patent-eligible applications of those laws of nature. The Court held that the patent claims at issue effectively claim the underlying laws of nature themselves and thus ran afoul of the prohibition on patenting laws of nature, were not patent eligible and therefore, were determined to be invalid. In another example, on June 19, 2014, the United States Supreme Court reaffirmed in Alice Corporation Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank International that a patent claim\ndirected to a judicial exception is invalid unless the claim recites additional elements that amount to \u201csignificantly more\u201d than a law of nature, a natural phenomenon, or an abstract idea. As a result, unless the claims of our U.S. patents contain sufficient inventive content above and beyond the natural correlations underlying our claimed processes, we will not succeed in enforcing our U.S. patents. Similarly, unless the claims of our pending U.S. patent applications that involve natural correlations contain sufficient inventive content above and beyond those natural correlations, we may be unable to obtain issued U.S. patents based on those applications, which may preclude or limit the patent protection available for our diagnostic tests and therapeutic methods.\nIn addition, we cannot be certain that we hold the rights to the technology covered by pending patent applications or to other proprietary technology required for us to commercialize our proposed products. Rights in applications filed by us or our licensors may be affected adversely by patent applications filed by others which have not yet been published. For example, because certain U.S. patent applications are confidential until patents issue, such as applications filed prior to November 29, 2000, or applications filed after that date which will not be filed in foreign countries, third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of those applications, and our patent applications may not have priority over those applications. For this and other reasons, we may be unable to secure desired patent rights, thereby losing desired exclusivity or co-exclusivity. It is also possible that one or more organizations will hold patent rights to which we will need a license. If those organizations refuse to grant us a license to such patent rights on reasonable terms, we will not be able to market our products.\nIf third parties assert that we have infringed their patents and proprietary rights or challenge the validity of our patents and proprietary rights, we may become involved in intellectual property disputes and litigation that would be costly, time consuming, and delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our current and proposed products.\nOur ability to commercialize our current and proposed products depends on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our current and proposed products without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may allege that our proposed products or our methods or discoveries infringe their intellectual property rights. Numerous U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in fields that relate to our proposed products and our underlying methodologies and discoveries, including patents and patent applications claiming methods for the discovery of biomarkers or biomarker sets and assay systems and methods designed to exploit them clinically in drug discovery efforts or in selection of patients.\nA third party may sue us for infringing its patent rights. Likewise, we may need to resort to litigation to enforce a patent issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. In addition, a third party may claim that we have improperly obtained or used its confidential or proprietary information. The cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to intellectual property rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and the litigation would divert our management\u2019s attention from other aspects of our business. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue our operations.\nIf we are found to infringe upon intellectual property rights of third parties, we might be forced to pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed on such parties\u2019 patent rights. In addition to any damages we might have to pay, a court could require us to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license. Any license required under any patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, such licenses are likely to be non-exclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license and are unable to design around a patent, we may be unable to effectively market some or all of our products, which could limit our ability to generate revenue or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations. Moreover, we expect that a number of our collaborations will provide that royalties payable to us\nfor licenses to our intellectual property may be offset by amounts paid by our collaborators to third parties who have competing or superior intellectual property positions in the relevant fields, which could result in significant reductions in our revenue from products developed through collaborations.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology, pharmaceutical or diagnostic products companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. While we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed the former employer\u2019s intellectual property, trade secrets or other proprietary information. Litigation based on such allegations may be brought against us, and even if we are successful in defending ourselves, we could incur substantial costs and our management could be distracted. If we fail in defending such allegations, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license development or commercialization rights to products or technology from third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nSeveral of our collaboration agreements provide for licenses to us of intellectual property or sharing of rights to intellectual property that is important to our business, and we may enter into additional agreements in the future that provide licenses to us of valuable technology. These licenses impose, and future licenses may impose, various commercialization milestones and other obligations on us, including the obligation to terminate our use of patented subject matter under certain contingencies. If a licensor becomes entitled to, and exercises, termination rights under a license, we would lose valuable rights and our ability to develop our products. We may need to license other intellectual property to commercialize future products. Our business may suffer if any current or future licenses terminate, if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license or fail to prevent infringement by third parties, if the licensed patents or other rights are found to be invalid or if we are unable to enter into necessary licenses on acceptable terms.\nIf we are unable to protect our trade secrets, we may be unable to protect our interests in proprietary technology, processes and know-how that is not patentable or for which we have elected not to seek patent protection.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, processes and know-how, including, particularly, our biomarker discovery methodologies. In an effort to protect our unpatented proprietary technology, processes and know-how, we require our employees, consultants, collaborators, contract manufacturers and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements. These agreements, however, may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information, in particular as we are required to make such information available to a larger pool of people as we seek to validate and commercialize our proposed products. These agreements may be breached, and we may not become aware of, or have adequate remedies in the event of, any such breach. In addition, in some situations, these agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees and consultants have previous employment or consulting relationships. Also, others may independently develop substantially equivalent technology, processes and know-how or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary technology, processes and know-how, competitors may be able to use this information to develop products that compete with our products, which could adversely impact our business.\nRisks Related To the Growth of Our Management Team, Workforce, Manufacturing and Facilities\nFollowing our reduction in force since September 2014, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 68% of our headcount, we may not be able to retain our remaining employees.\nSince September 11, 2014, we have implemented a reduction of approximately 68% of our workforce, or 15 people, leaving seven employees, which we refer to as the Restructuring. We took this step in order to reduce our\noperating expenses and extend our cash runway in anticipation of the commercial launch of automated versions of our galectin-3 test. The automated galectin-3 tests are being developed and commercialized by our diagnostic instrument manufacturing partners and will be performed on our partners\u2019 automated platforms. We expect the first automated version of the galectin-3 test to be launched in the United States in mid-2015. The Restructuring primarily eliminated our sales and marketing organization and removed certain positions in other functional areas, while preserving some senior management and other critical roles to support the clinical and commercial adoption of galectin-3 testing by generating, publishing and publicizing data derived from clinical research studies and by expanding the BGM Galectin-3 Test\u2019s labeling indications for use through additional clinical studies and clearances by the FDA.\nAs a result of the Restructuring, we are heavily dependent upon our ability to retain our remaining employees. The loss of the service of any of our remaining employees may significantly delay or prevent our ability to continue our operations. Given the magnitude of our September 2014 reduction in force, the morale of our remaining employees may be lower, employees may be distracted and any one of our remaining employees could terminate his or her employment with us at any time. A departing employee\u2019s expertise would be difficult to replace and the failure to do so on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business goals. There can be no assurance that we will have the financial resources or otherwise to be successful in retaining our remaining personnel and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Restructuring may prove to be more disruptive to our operations than we anticipated. For example, cost savings measures may distract management from our core business, harm our reputation, yield unanticipated consequences, such as attrition beyond the planned Restructuring, or increased difficulties in our day-to- day operations. Any failure to retain our qualified personnel could prevent us from successfully growing our business by expanding the number of health care clinical laboratories, hospitals, and health care providers with which we do business or impair our ability to maintain sales levels of, and/or support sales growth of, our galectin-3 test.\nWe have only a limited number of employees to manage and operate our business.\nAs of March 15, 2015, we employed seven full-time employees. Due to our limited cash, we have implemented a plan designed to focus our capital resources on our most promising indications and further reduce our cash utilization. Our focus on reducing our cash utilization requires us to manage and operate our business in a highly efficient manner. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all of the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish.\nFailures in our information technology and storage systems could significantly disrupt our operations.\nOur ability to execute our business plan depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems, or IT systems. Despite the implementation of security measures, IT systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts, terrorism and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our IT systems, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data, could result in a material disruption in our operations. Furthermore, to the extent that any disruption or security breach resulted in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nWe rely on a single third party to manufacture and supply our products. Any problems experienced by this vendor could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of our products to us until this vendor cures the problem or until we locate and qualify an alternative source of supply.\nThe manufacture of our diagnostic products requires specialized equipment and utilizes complicated production processes that would be difficult, time-consuming and costly to duplicate. Corgenix Medical Corporation is\ncurrently the sole third-party manufacturer of our BGM Galectin-3 Test. Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our third-party manufacturer could have a significant negative impact on our ability to manufacture products on our own and would cause us to seek additional third-party manufacturing contracts, thereby increasing our development and any commercialization costs, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. We may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed coverage under our manufacturer\u2019s insurance policies. Events beyond our control, such as natural disasters, fire, sabotage or business accidents could have a significant negative impact on our operations by disrupting our product development and commercialization efforts until our third-party manufacturer can repair its facility or put in place third-party contract manufacturers to assume this manufacturing role, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, if we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer or the re-verification of an existing manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates or produce approved products in a timely manner. Any delay or interruption in our clinical studies for the validation and commercialization of our products or product candidates could negatively affect our business.\nIf we become subject to product liability claims, we may be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage, and such claims may harm our business in other ways.\nOur business exposes us to product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, production, marketing and sale of diagnostic products. Although we currently maintain limited product liability insurance, we anticipate needing to secure additional product liability insurance for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. We cannot be certain whether we will be able to secure such insurance on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. A product liability claim in excess of any insurance coverage we may obtain would have to be paid out of our cash reserves and would significantly harm our business. In addition, any injunction or other restriction on our ability to sell against one of our product candidates would also significantly harm our business.\nThe marketing, sale and use of our current or future diagnostic tests could lead to the filing of product liability claims if someone were to allege that our product failed to perform as it was designed. A product liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time consuming for us to defend. We cannot provide assurance that our product liability insurance would protect us from the financial impact of defending a product liability claim. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could cause injury to our reputation, result in the recall of our products, or cause current collaborators to terminate existing agreements and potential collaborators to seek other partners, any of which could impact our results of operations.\nRisks Related To Our Common Stock\nIf we fail to regain and maintain compliance with the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted.\nOur common stock is currently listed for trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market. As disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 13, 2015, we were notified by NASDAQ that, because we did not maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00, or minimum bid price deficiency, and did not meet the minimum $2.5 million in stockholders\u2019 equity, or stockholders\u2019 equity deficiency, as required by NASDAQ Listing Rules, our common stock would be subject to delisting unless we timely request a hearing before the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel, or the Panel. We have requested a hearing, at which we will request an extension within which to pursue our plan to regain and maintain compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing on NASDAQ. While our common stock will remain listed and continue to trade on NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cBGMD\u201d pending the hearing and the expiration of any extension granted by the Panel, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant our request for continued listing or that we will be able to regain compliance within any extension period granted by the Panel.\nA delisting of our common stock from The NASDAQ Capital Market could substantially further reduce the liquidity of our common stock and result in a corresponding material reduction in the price of our common stock. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers and employees and fewer business development opportunities.\nThe trading market in our common stock has been extremely limited and substantially less liquid than the average trading market for a stock listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. Additionally, our affiliates hold approximately 19% of our outstanding shares of common stock, as of March 15, 2015, which substantially reduces the liquidity of our common stock and contributes to the limited trading volume for our common stock.\nSince our initial listing on The NASDAQ Global Market on February 4, 2011 and the transfer of our listing to The NASDAQ Capital Market on January 27, 2014, the trading market in our common stock has been extremely limited and substantially less liquid than the average trading market for companies listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. The listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market does not assure that a meaningful, consistent and liquid trading market currently exists. We cannot predict whether a more active market for our common stock will develop in the future. An absence of an active trading market could adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell our common stock at current market prices in short time periods, or possibly at all. Additionally, market visibility for our common stock may be limited and such lack of visibility may have a depressive effect on the market price for our common stock.\nOur affiliates hold approximately 19% of our outstanding shares of common stock, as of March 15, 2015, which adversely affects the liquidity of the trading market for our common stock; in as much as federal securities laws restrict sales of our shares by these stockholders. If our affiliates continue to hold their shares of common stock, there will be limited trading volume in our common stock, which may make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares or increase the volatility of our stock price.\nOur stock price is likely to be volatile and the market price of our common stock may drop.\nPrior to our initial public offering in February 2011, there was no public market for our common stock and having been a publicly traded company for only three years, it is too early to determine whether an active trading market will develop and continue. There is a limited history, exacerbated by low average daily trading volume, on which to gauge the volatility of our stock price. The stock markets and the markets for medical diagnostics and biotechnology stocks in particular, have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. For example, our common stock traded as high as $2.42 and as low as $0.27 during 2014. Some of the many factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nour ability to commercialize the products, if any, that we are able to develop;\n\u2022\nthe progress and results of our product candidate development efforts;\n\u2022\nactions taken by regulatory authorities with respect to our product candidates, or our sales and marketing activities;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of legal actions to which we may become a party;\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning product development results or intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nuncertainty as to whether our common stock will remain listed on NASDAQ;\n\u2022\nuncertainty as to if and when we will engage in any strategic transaction;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of securities or the incurrence of additional debt;\n\u2022\nrestatements of our financial results and/or material weaknesses in our internal controls;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or the diagnostic products industry by securities or industry analysts;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our operating results; and\n\u2022\ndeviations in our operating results from the estimates of securities analysts or other analyst comments.\nAny broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Investors may not be able to sell when they desire due to insufficient buyer demand and may realize less than, or lose all of, their investment.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our financial condition, operating results and reputation.\nInsiders control a substantial amount of our outstanding common stock, which could delay or prevent a change in corporate control or result in the entrenchment of management and/or the board of directors.\nCertain of our directors, principal stockholders and/or their affiliates, including Flagship Ventures, or Flagship, General Electric Pension Trust, or GE, and Stelios Papadopoulos control approximately 23% of our outstanding common stock as of February 28, 2015. Accordingly, these stockholders, if acting as a group, or Flagship, which alone controls approximately 15% of our outstanding common stock as of February 28, 2015, will have control or substantial influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, and they may in some instances exercise this control or substantial influence in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control, could deprive investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for our common stock as part of a sale and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe requirements of being a public company require greater resources, increase our costs and distract our management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company with equity securities listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are required to comply with certain rules, regulations and requirements with which we were not required to comply prior to becoming a public company.\nComplying with rules, regulations and requirements requires substantial effort on the part of our board of directors and management and will continue to increase our costs and expenses. As a public company, we are required to:\n\u2022\ninstitute and maintain a more formalized function of internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nprepare and distribute periodic and current public reports;\n\u2022\nmaintain internal policies relating to disclosure controls and procedures and insider trading, among others;\n\u2022\ninvolve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities; and\n\u2022\nmaintain an investor relations function, including the provision of certain information on our website.\nCompliance with these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these new rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, the price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our industry. If one or more of the analysts who cover us or our industry make\nunfavorable comments about our market opportunity or product candidates or downgrade our common stock, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the market price of our common stock or trading volume to decline.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.\nWe may seek the additional capital necessary to fund our operations through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, and collaborative and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, existing stockholders ownership interests will be diluted and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect their rights as a stockholder. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, our stockholders will benefit from their investment in shares only if our common stock appreciates in value.\nWe have not paid dividends to our stockholders since our inception and we are currently prohibited from making any dividend payments under the terms of the term loan facility with our lenders. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove the current members of our board and management.\nCertain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. Furthermore, these provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. These provisions:\n\u2022\nallow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors, such that not all members of the board of directors may be elected at one time;\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock, the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the board of directors that, if issued, could operate as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that is not approved by our board of directors;\n\u2022\nrequire that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations to our board of directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of the holders of 80% of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote in order to amend certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may, unless certain criteria are met, prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of the voting rights on our common stock, from merging or combining with us for a prescribed period of time.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock Purchase Agreement with Aspire Capital\nThe sale of our common stock to Aspire Capital would cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders.\nIn January 2013, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement, or the purchase agreement, with Aspire Capital, which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, Aspire Capital is committed to purchase, at our option, up to an aggregate of $12 million of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock over the two-year term of the purchase agreement which expires on June 7, 2015. In addition, upon entering into the purchase agreement, we issued commitment shares to Aspire Capital for no cash consideration, and we may sell additional shares to Aspire Capital under the purchase agreement. We anticipate that the shares we issue to Aspire Capital under the purchase agreement will later be sold by Aspire Capital over approximately the same year period although we have no control over their sales process. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by us to Aspire Capital will result in immediate dilution to our existing stockholders and to purchasers of common stock in the offering contemplated hereby.\nThe sale by us of shares to Aspire Capital under the purchase agreement could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe may cause Aspire Capital to purchase all, some or none of the $12 million of common stock offered under the purchase agreement, up to a maximum of 4,106,071 total shares issued under the purchase agreement without stockholder approval. The purchase price for the common stock we may sell to Aspire Capital pursuant to the purchase agreement will fluctuate based on the trading price of our common stock in the public market. In addition, Aspire Capital may then sell all, some or none of the shares we issue to it under the purchase agreement. Depending upon market liquidity during that period, a resale of shares by Aspire Capital at any given time could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by us to Aspire Capital or by Aspire Capital in the open market, or the anticipation of such sales, could cause the price of our common stock to decline and make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect such sales.\nSecurities regulations may restrict our ability to access the full amount of our committed equity facility with Aspire Capital.\nAlthough we have entered into the purchase agreement with Aspire Capital for a maximum amount of $12 million, NASDAQ rules limit our ability to issue more than 19.99% of our currently outstanding shares to Aspire Capital without stockholder approval to exceed that amount. Similarly, SEC rules may also restrict our ability to readily access the full amount of the committed equity facility or to access the facility in a manner that would be meaningful to fund our operations and execute on our commercialization strategy to the extent we believe would be required to generate value for our stockholders. As a result, we may not realize the full value of the facility, which would undermine our ability to sufficiently address our need for additional capital, and our financial condition and results of operations would be negatively affected.", "PERMNO": 12574, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "BGMD"}
