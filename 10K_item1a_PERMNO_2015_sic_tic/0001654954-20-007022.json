RISK FACTORS\nWe are providing risk factors we believe are applicable to the company and our business even though we are not required to provide this information due to our status as a smaller reporting company.\nThe drug testing market is highly competitive.\nThe market for drug tests used at the point of collection is highly competitive. Several companies produce drug tests that compete directly with products and they produce their products outside the United State at a lower cost. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources, allowing them to devote substantially more resources to business and product development and marketing efforts. Our inability to successfully address any competitive risk factors could negatively impact sales and our ability to achieve profitability.\nPossible inability to hire and retain qualified personnel.\nWe need skilled sales and marketing, technical and production personnel to maintain and/or grow our business. If we fail to retain our present staff or hire additional qualified personnel our business could suffer; specifically in the case of sales personnel. An inability to find qualified sales representatives would negatively impact our ability to maintain and/or grow sales.\nAny adverse changes in our regulatory framework could negatively impact our business, and costs to obtain regulatory clearance are material.\nAlthough we are unaware of any recent or upcoming changes in regulatory standards related to the marketing of our drug tests, changes in regulatory requirements could negatively impact our business if we are unable to comply with the changes. Typically, the cost to comply with regulatory changes is significant; especially if additional applications for marketing clearance from FDA are required. The cost of filing a 510(k) marketing clearance is material and can have a negative impact on efforts to improve our financial performance. If regulatory standards change in the future, there can be no assurance that we will receive marketing clearances from FDA, if and when we apply for them.\nOn March 23, 2020, we announced in a press release that we were marketing, via a distribution partnership, a Rapid Test to detect Covid-19 antibodies in whole blood, serum or plasma. The test is being marketed under the March 16, 2020 Emergency Use Authorization (\u201cEUA\u201d) policy set forth by the FDA and on May 29, 2020, an EUA was issued by the FDA. The revocation of the EUA could negatively impact our business and stop any future sales of the Covid-19 antibody tests.\nWe rely on intellectual property rights and contractual non-disclosure obligations to protect our proprietary information (including customer information). These rights and obligations may not adequately protect our proprietary information, and an inability to protect our proprietary information can harm our business.\nWe rely on confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our confidential and proprietary information. Confidential and proprietary information (such as components and product costing, customer pricing structures, customer information, vendor information, internal financial information, production processes, new product developments, product enhancements and other material, non-public information) is protected under non-disclosure agreements with our personnel and consultants. If these individuals do not comply with their obligations under these agreements, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect our confidential information and the use of this information by the breaching individual may cause harm to our business. In fact, throughout Fiscal 2018 and into Fiscal 2019, we were engaged in litigation with Todd Bailey (\u201cBailey\u201d), a former Vice President, Sales & Marketing/Consultant of the Company. The complaint that we filed against Bailey was related to allegations that Bailey used our confidential and proprietary information to circumvent and interfere with long-standing ABMC customers. This interference resulted in contracts being awarded to Bailey\u2019s company, Premier Biotech Inc., thereby causing harm to our business. We incurred increased legal fees in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 as a result of this litigation and ultimately, the litigation was settled in August 2019. The terms of the settlement remain confidential.\nWe also rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products, dilute our trademarks, or otherwise infringe upon our rights. We may be required to incur significant costs to protect our intellectual property right under laws of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not ensure that our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States or abroad will be adequate. Policing and enforcement against the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and other confidential proprietary information could entail significant expenses and could prove difficult or impossible. Such significant expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOne of our customers accounted for more than 10% of our total net sales in Fiscal 2019.\nOne of our customers accounted for 44.8% and 44% of our net sales in Fiscal 2019 and in Fiscal 2018, respectively. We currently have a contract in place with this long-standing customer that does not expire in the near future. However, there can be no assurance that this customer, or any of our current customers will continue to place orders, or that orders by existing customers will continue at current or historical levels.\nWe depend on key personnel to manage our business effectively.\nWe are dependent on the expertise and experience of senior management for our future success. The loss of senior management personnel could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Melissa A. Waterhouse serves as our sole executive officer. She serves as Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer. We have an employment agreement in place with Ms. Waterhouse, but there can be no assurance that Ms. Waterhouse will continue her employment. The loss of Ms. Waterhouse could disrupt the business and have a negative impact on business results. We also have a number of other individuals in senior management positions. There can be no assurance that they too will continue their employment. We do not currently maintain key man insurance on Ms. Waterhouse.\nWe rely on third parties for raw materials used in our drug test products and in our bulk test strip contract manufacturing processes.\nWe currently have approximately 45 suppliers that provide us with the raw materials necessary to manufacture our drug-testing strips, our drug test kits and the products we supply third parties on a contract manufacturing basis. For most of our raw materials, we have multiple suppliers, but there are a few raw materials for which we only have one supplier. The loss of one or more of these suppliers, the non-performance of one or more of their materials or the lack of availability of raw materials could suspend our manufacturing process for one or more product lines. This interruption of the manufacturing process could impair our ability to fill customers\u2019 orders as they are placed, putting us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe have a significant amount of raw material and \u201cwork in process\u201d inventory on hand that may not be used in the year ended December 31, 2020 if the expected configuration of sales orders is not received at projected levels.\nWe had approximately $670,000 in raw material components for the manufacture of our products at December 31, 2019. The non-chemical raw material components may be retained and used in production indefinitely and the chemical raw materials components have lives in excess of 20 years. In addition to the raw material inventory, we had approximately $141,000 in \u201cwork in process\u201d (manufactured testing strips) inventory at December 31, 2019. The components for much of this \u201cwork in process\u201d inventory have lives of 12-36 months. If sales orders received are not for products that would utilize the raw material components, or if product developments make the raw materials obsolete, we may be required to dispose of these unused raw materials. In addition, since the components for much of the \u201cwork in process\u201d inventory have lives of 12-36 months, if sales orders within the next 12-36 months are not for products that contain the components of the \u201cwork in process\u201d inventory, we may need to discard this expired \u201cwork in process\u201d inventory. We have established an allowance for obsolete or slow moving inventory. At December 31, 2019, this allowance was $291,000. There can be no assurance that this allowance will continue to be adequate for the year ending December 31, 2020 and/or that it will not have to be adjusted in the future.\nInability to meet our operating plans could have a material adverse effect on our future performance.\nIf events and circumstances occur such that we do not meet our current operating plans, if we are unable to raise sufficient additional equity or debt financing, or our credit facilities are insufficient or not available, we may be required to further reduce expenses or take other steps which could have a material adverse effect on our future performance.\nWe incur costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nWe incur legal, accounting and other expenses as a result of our required compliance with certain regulations implemented by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d). Our executive management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance requirements, including but not limited to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Our management is required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (as a smaller reporting company, we are exempt from the requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring auditor\u2019s attestation related to internal controls over financial reporting). If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404(a), if we identify deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting, or if we are unable to comply with any other SEC regulations or requirements, the market price of our common shares could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nInability to comply with our debt obligations could result in our creditors declaring all amounts owed to them due and payable with immediate effect, or result in the collection of collateral by the creditor; both of which would have an adverse material impact on our business and our ability to continue operations.\nWe have a credit facility with Crestmark Bank consisting of revolving line of credit (the \u201cCrestmark LOC\u201d). The Crestmark LOC is secured by a first security interest in all of our receivables and inventory and security interest in all other assets of the Company (in accordance with permitted prior encumbrances), (together the \u201cCollateral\u201d). As of December 31, 2019, we were required to comply with a minimum Tangible Net Worth (\u201cTNW\u201d) Covenant of $(600,000). TNW is defined as: Total Assets less Total Liabilities less the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of non-trade accounts receivables, including accounts receivables from affiliated or related persons, (ii) prepaid expenses, (iii) deposits, (iv) net lease hold improvements, (v) goodwill and (vi) any other asset that would be treated as an intangible asset under GAAP; plus Subordinated Debt. Subordinated Debt means any and all indebtedness presently or in the future incurred by the Company to any creditor of the Company entering into a written subordination agreement with Crestmark. On June 22, 2020, we extended the Crestmark LOC and as a result of this extension, the TNW covenant was removed effective with the quarter ending June 30, 2020. We were not in compliance with the TNW covenant at December 31, 2019 and with the exception of the quarter ended June 30, 2019;we have not been in compliance with prior TNW covenants since December 31, 2017. We are in the process of obtaining a waiver from Crestmark Bank in connection with the non-compliance with the TNW covenant at December 31, 2019. If we are not compliant with the TNW covenant for the quarter ending March 31, 2020, we also expect to receive a waiver from Crestmark Bank.\nIn addition to the Crestmark LOC, we have a loan and security agreement with Cherokee Financial, LLC. (\u201cCherokee\u201d) which is secured by a first security interest in our real estate and machinery and equipment. In addition to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control, our ability to make payments to Cherokee Financial, LLC will depend primarily upon our future operating performance; which has been negatively impacted by the loss of material contracts and the increased price competition in our core markets for drug testing. In February 2020, we extended our loan facilities with Cherokee. (See Note J- Subsequent Event)\nA failure to comply with the Crestmark LOC TNW covenant as of December 31, 2019 or March 31, 2020 (that is not waived by Crestmark Bank) and/or repay any of our debt obligations could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the Company being required to pay much higher costs associated with the indebtedness and/or enable our creditors to declare all amounts owed to them due and payable with immediate effect. If we are forced to refinance our debt on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and rates. We may also be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures or seeking additional equity capital. There can be no assurances that any of these strategies could be implemented on satisfactory terms, if at all, or that future borrowings or equity financing would be available for the payment of any indebtedness we may have. In addition, in an event of default, our creditors could begin proceedings to collect the collateral securing the debt. This would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations.\nWe have a history of incurring net losses and as of December 31, 2019, we have a negative stockholders\u2019 equity.\nSince our inception and throughout most of our history, we have incurred net losses, including but not limited to, a net loss of $681,000 incurred in Fiscal 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we also reported negative stockholders\u2019 equity of $790,000. We incur substantial expenditures for sales and marketing, general and administrative and research and development purposes. Our ability to achieve profitability in the future will primarily depend on our ability to increase sales of our products. Stockholders\u2019 equity improvement will also be dependent on our ability to increase sales which will increase the value of our assets and decrease our liabilities. Future profitability is also dependent on our ability to reduce manufacturing costs and successfully introduce new products or new versions of our existing products into the marketplace. There can be no assurance that we will be able to increase our revenues at a rate that equals or exceeds expenditures. Our failure to increase sales while controlling sales and marketing, general and administrative, and research and development costs (relative to sales) would result in additional losses.\nWe may need additional funding for our existing and future operations.\nOur financial statements for Fiscal 2019 were prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. If sales do not improve, our current cash balances and cash generated from future operations may not be sufficient to fund operations through June 2021. Future events, including the expenses and difficulties which may be encountered in maintaining a market for our products could make cash on hand and cash available under our line of credit facility insufficient to fund operations. If this happens, we may be requiredto sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities. Any equity financing would result in further dilution to existing shareholders. There can be no assurance that any of these financings will be available or that we will be able to complete such financing on satisfactory terms.\nPotential issuance and exercise of new options and warrants and, exercise of outstanding options could adversely affect the value of our securities.\nWe currently have two non-statutory stock option plans, the Fiscal 2001 Non-statutory Stock Option Plan (the \u201c2001 Plan\u201d) and the 2013 Equity Compensation Plan (the \u201c2013 Plan\u201d). Both plans have been adopted by our Board of Directors and approved by our shareholders. The common shares underlying the exercise of the stock options under the 2001 Plan have been registered with the SEC; however the common shares underlying the exercise of the stock options under the 2013 Plan have not been registered with the SEC.\nBoth the 2001 Plan and the 2013 Plan have options available for future issuance. As of December 31, 2019, there were 2,252,000 options issued and outstanding under the 2001 Plan. There were no options issued under the 2013 Plan, making the total issued and outstanding options 2,252,000 as of December 31, 2019. Of the total options issued and outstanding, 2,172,000 are fully vested as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, there were 1,465,000 options available for issuance under the 2001 Plan and 4,000,000 options available for issuance under the 2013 Plan. As of December 31, 2019, we had 2,000,000 warrants issued and outstanding, however, the 2,000,000 warrants expired on January 16, 2020.\nIf outstanding stock options are exercised, the common shares issued will be freely tradable, increasing the total number of common shares issued and outstanding. If these shares are offered for sale in the public market, the sales could adversely affect the prevailing market price by lowering the bid price of our securities. The exercise of these stock options could also materially impair our ability to raise capital through the future sale of equity securities because issuance of the common shares underlying the stock options would cause further dilution of our securities. In addition, in the event of any change in the outstanding shares of our common stock by reason of any recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reorganization consolidation, combination or exchange of shares, merger or any other changes in our corporate or capital structure or our common shares, the number and class of shares covered by the stock options and/or the exercise price of the stock options may be adjusted as set forth in their plans.\nSubstantial resale of restricted securities may depress the market price of our securities.\nThere are 11,254,918 common shares presently issued and outstanding as of the date hereof that are \u201crestricted securities\u201d as that term is defined under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). These securities may be sold in compliance with Rule 144 of the Securities Act (\u201cRule 144\u201d), or pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act. Rule 144 addresses sales of restricted securities by affiliates and non-affiliates of an issuer. An \u201caffiliate\u201d is a person, such as an officer, director or large shareholder, in a relationship of control with the issuer. \u201cControl\u201d means the power to direct the management and policies of the company in question, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise. If someone buys securities from a controlling person or an affiliate, they take restricted securities, even if they were not restricted in the affiliate's hands.\nA person who is not an affiliate of the issuer (and who has not been for at least three months) and has held the restricted securities for at least one year can sell the securities without regard to restrictions. If the non-affiliate had held the securities for at least six months but less than one year, the securities may be sold by the non-affiliate as long as the current public information condition has been met (i.e. that the issuer has complied with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d)).\nWe are subject to reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Under Rule 144, if a holder of securities is an affiliate of an issuer subject to Exchange Act reporting requirements, the securities must be held for at least six months. In addition, the number of equity securities sold during any three-month period cannot exceed 1% of the outstanding shares of the same class being sold. The securities must be sold in unsolicited, routine trading transactions and brokers may not receive more than normal commission. Affiliates must also file a notice with the SEC on Form 144 if a sale involves more than 5,000 shares or the aggregate dollar amount is greater than $50,000 in any three-month period. The sale must take place within three months of filing the Form 144 and, if the securities have not been sold, an amended notice must be filed. Investors should be aware that sales under Rule 144 or pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Securities Act might depress the market price of our securities in any market for such shares.\nOur securities are currently trading on the OTC Markets Group (under their OTC Pink\u00ae Open Market), and are subject to SEC \u201cpenny stock,\u201d rules, which could make it more difficult for a broker-dealer to trade our common shares, for an investor to acquire or dispose of our common shares in the secondary market and for us to retain or attract market makers.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations that define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than $5.00, subject to certain exceptions, such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange or securities of an issuer in continuous operation for more than three years whose net tangible assets are in excess of $2 million, or an issuer that has average revenue of at least $6 million for the last three years. Our common shares are currently trading on the OTC Markets Group., under their OTC Pink Open Market. As of Fiscal 2019, our net tangible assets did not exceed $2 million, and our average revenue for the last three years was only $4,147,000, so our securities do not currently qualify for exclusion from the \u201cpenny stock\u201d definitions. Therefore, our common shares are subject to \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. For any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers, subject to certain exceptions. For these reasons, a broker-dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market. Therefore, broker-dealers may be less willing or able to sell or make a market in our securities because of the penny stock disclosure rules. Not maintaining a listing on a major stock market may result in a decrease in the trading price of our securities due to a decrease in liquidity and less interest by institutions and individuals in investing in our securities, and could also make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future. Furthermore, listing on OTC Market Group may make it more difficult to retain and attract market makers. In the event that market makers cease to function as such, public trading of our securities will be adversely affected or may cease entirely.\nIt is still uncertain what the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Company and, the degree to which the pandemic will adversely affect our business, revenues, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) spread globally. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic. To date, this global pandemic has severely impacted levels of economic activity around the world. In response to this pandemic, governments and public health officials of many countries, states, cities and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions to mitigate the spread and severity of COVID-19, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations and advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes by imposing shelter-in-place orders. We cannot presently predict the scope and ultimate severity or duration of the coronavirus pandemic and any possible related disruptions to our business, but the coronavirus pandemic and the resulting economic and commercial shutdowns to date have negatively impacted our ability to conduct business in accordance with our plans. Disruptions to our business include restrictions on the ability of our sales and marketing personnel to travel, some disruptions of our global supply chain, and reduced demand and/or suspension of operations by our customers. The primary markets for our DOA products are all negatively impacted by the suspensions (partial or whole) of operation and as of the date of this report, our DOA revenues have declined from the prior year.\nWe cannot predict the degree to, or the time period over, which our business will be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. There are numerous uncertainties associated with this outbreak, including the number of individuals who will become infected, whether a vaccine or cure that mitigates the effect of the virus will be synthesized, and, if so, when such vaccine or cure will be ready to be used, the extent of the protective and preventative measures that have been put in place by both governmental entities and other businesses and those that may be put in place in the future, whether the coronavirus\u2019 impact will be seasonal and the impact on the U.S. and world economy, and various other uncertainties. Further, even after containment of the virus any significant reduction in employee willingness to return to work would result in a reduction of manufacturing capacity.\nOn March 23, 2020, we announced in a press release that we were marketing, via a distribution partnership, a Rapid Test to detect Covid-19 antibodies in whole blood, serum or plasma. The test is being marketed under the March 16, 2020 Emergency Use Authorization (\u201cEUA\u201d) policy set forth by the FDA and on May 29, 2020, an EUA was issued by the FDA.\nWe expect COVID-19 will continue to negatively affect customer demand of our DOA products in Fiscal 2021 or at least part of Fiscal 2021, and the duration of this negative impact is uncertain, we do not yet know the full extent of the negative impact of COVID-19 on our DOA business test on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business, operating results, financial condition, or liquidity in the future will depend on future developments which are evolving and highly uncertain including the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions, business and workforce disruptions, the timing of reopening the economic regions in which we and our customers do business and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the disease. In addition, resurgence in the number of cases of COVID-19 could further negatively impact our business.\nAnd finally, while we expect the marketing of the Covid-19 test to positively impact our revenues in Fiscal 2021, we do not yet know the full extent of the positive impact of COVID-19 test sales on our business, our financial condition and results of operations. The extent to which sales of the COVID-19 test may impact our business, operating results, financial condition, or liquidity in the future will depend on future developments which are evolving and highly uncertain including the duration of the outbreak and the need for antibody testing in the future.", "PERMNO": 85671, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "ABMC"}
