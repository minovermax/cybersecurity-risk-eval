{"cik": "3453", "company": "Matson, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company\u2019s business faces the risks set forth below, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. All forward-looking statements made by the Company or on the Company\u2019s behalf are qualified by the risks described below.\nRisks Relating To Operations\nChanges in U.S., global, or regional economic conditions that result in a decrease in consumer confidence or market demand for the Company\u2019s services and products in Hawaii, the U.S. Mainland, Guam, Asia or South Pacific may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, liquidity, or cash flows.\nA weakening of the U.S., Guam, Asian, South Pacific or global economies may adversely impact the level of freight volumes and freight rates. Within the U.S., a weakening of economic drivers in Hawaii, which include tourism, military spending, construction starts, personal income growth, and employment, or the weakening of consumer confidence, market demand, the economy in the U.S. Mainland, or the effect of a change in the strength of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies, may further reduce the demand for goods to and from Hawaii and Asia, travel to Hawaii and domestic transportation of goods, adversely affecting inland and ocean transportation volumes or rates. We are unable to determine the full impact of congressional budget action on our carriage of military cargo, but we believe it continues to negatively impact us, and we could continue to be impacted by future cuts to federal programs, including Defense Department programs as a result of congressional budget action. In addition, overcapacity in the global or transpacific ocean transportation markets or a change in the cost of goods or currency exchange rates may adversely affect freight volumes and rates in the Company\u2019s China service.\nThe Company may face new or increased competition.\nThe Company may face new competition by established or start-up shipping operators that enter the Company\u2019s markets. The entry of a new competitor or the addition of ships or capacity by existing competition on any of the Company\u2019s routes could result in a significant increase in available shipping capacity that could have an adverse effect on volumes and rates.\nOne current competitor, Pasha, expects to launch a new combination container/ roll-on/roll off vessel during the first half of 2015, which will increase containership capacity in the Hawaii trade, and could affect rates and volumes in the Hawaii trade lane on an intermediate term basis. In addition, Pasha has agreed to buy Horizon\u2019s Hawaii business, which could alter the competitive dynamics in the Hawaii trade.\nThe loss of or damage to key vendor, agent and customer relationships may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are dependent on their relationships with key vendors, agents and customers, and derive a significant portion of their revenues from the Company\u2019s largest customers. The Company could be adversely affected by any changes in the services provided, or changes to the costs of services provided by key vendors and agents. Relationships with railroads and shipping companies and agents are important in the Company\u2019s intermodal business. The Company\u2019s business also relies on its relationships with the military, freight forwarders, large retailers and consumer goods and automobile manufacturers, as well as other larger customers. For 2014, the Company\u2019s Ocean Transportation segment\u2019s ten largest customers accounted for approximately 25 percent of the business\u2019 revenue. For 2014, the Company\u2019s Logistics segment\u2019s ten largest customers accounted for approximately 26 percent of the business\u2019 revenue. The loss of or damage to any of these key relationships may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and revenue.\nAn increase in fuel prices, or changes in the Company\u2019s ability to collect fuel surcharges, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s profits.\nFuel is a significant operating expense for the Company\u2019s Ocean Transportation business. The price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Increases in the price of fuel may adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations based on market and competitive conditions. Increases in fuel costs also can lead to other expense increases, for example, increased costs of energy and purchased transportation services. In the Company\u2019s Ocean Transportation and Logistics services segments, the Company is able to utilize fuel surcharges to partially recover increases in fuel expense, although increases in the fuel surcharge may adversely affect the Company\u2019s competitive position and may not correspond exactly with the timing of increases in fuel expense. Changes in the Company\u2019s ability to collect fuel surcharges also may adversely affect its results of operations.\nWork stoppages or other labor disruptions caused by unionized workers of the Company, other workers or their unions in related industries may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, Matson and its subsidiaries had 1,056 employees, of which 285 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions. Of these covered employees, 252 are subject to collective bargaining agreements that expired in 2014. In addition, at December 31, 2014, the active Matson fleet employed seagoing personnel in 235 billets. Each billet corresponds to a position on a ship that typically is filled by two or more employees, because seagoing personnel rotate between active sea-duty and time ashore. Such employees are also subject to collective bargaining agreements. Furthermore, the Company relies on the services of third-parties including SSAT and its parent company, SSA, that employ persons covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nMatson and SSAT are members of the Pacific Maritime Association (\u201cPMA\u201d), which on behalf of its members negotiates collective bargaining agreements with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (\u201cILWU\u201d) on the U.S. West Coast. The PMA/ILWU collective bargaining agreements that cover substantially all U.S. West Coast longshore labor expired on July 1, 2014. On February 20, 2015, the PMA and the ILWU announced a tentative agreement on a new five-year contract covering longshore workers at all 29 U.S. West Coast ports. The tentative agreement is subject to ratification by both the PMA and ILWU, and no assurance can be given that the tentative agreement will be ratified by both parties. If the tentative agreement is not ratified, Matson and SSAT could be subject to future slow-downs, strikes, lock-outs or other disruptions that may adversely impact Matson\u2019s or SSAT\u2019s operations.\nMatson also has collective bargaining agreements with ILWU labor in Hawaii, and ILWU office clerical workers in Oakland, each of which expired on June 30, 2014. Workers under these agreements are operating under extensions with the unions. With a tentative agreement reached between the PMA and the ILWU, negotiations with the ILWU labor in Hawaii are expected to resume, and negotiations with the ILWU office clerical workers in Oakland are expected to commence; however no assurance can be given that agreements will be reached without slow-downs, strikes, lock-outs or other disruptions that may adversely impact Matson\u2019s operations.\nThe Company is susceptible to weather and natural disasters.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are vulnerable to disruption as a result of weather and natural disasters such as bad weather at sea, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes. Such events will interfere with the Company\u2019s ability to provide on-time scheduled service, resulting in increased expenses and potential loss of business associated with such events. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters can result in interference with the Company\u2019s terminal operations, and may cause serious damage to its vessels, loss or damage to containers, cargo and other equipment, and loss of life or physical injury to its employees, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company maintains casualty and liability insurance policies, which are generally subject to large retentions and deductibles. Some types of losses, such as losses resulting from a port blockage, generally are not insured. In some cases the Company retains the entire risk of loss because it is not economically prudent to purchase insurance coverage or because of the perceived remoteness of the risk. Other risks are uninsured because insurance coverage may not be commercially available. Finally, the Company retains all risk of loss that exceeds the limits of its insurance.\nThe Company\u2019s significant operating agreements and leases could be replaced on less favorable terms or may not be replaced.\nThe significant operating agreements and leases of the Company in its various businesses expire at various points in the future and may not be replaced or could be replaced on less favorable terms, thereby adversely affecting the Company\u2019s future financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company leases a 105-acre marine terminal at Honolulu, Hawaii that expires in September 2016. The Company is currently in the process of renewing this lease.\nIf we are not able to use our information technology and communications systems effectively, our ability to conduct business might be negatively impacted.\nThe Company is highly dependent on the proper functioning of our information technology systems to enable operations and compete effectively. Our information technology systems rely on third party service providers for access to the Internet, satellite-based communications systems, the electric grid, database storage facilities and telecommunications providers. We have no control over the operations of these third-party service providers. If our information technology and communications systems experience reliability issues, integration or compatibility concerns or if our third party providers are unable to perform effectively or experience disruptions or failures, there could be an adverse impact on the availability and functioning of our information technology and communications systems, which could lead to business disruption or inefficiencies, reputational harm or a loss of customers that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur information technology systems may be exposed to cybersecurity risks and other disruptions that could impair the Company\u2019s ability to operate and adversely affect its business.\nThe Company relies extensively on its information technology systems and third party service providers, including for accounting, billing, disbursement, cargo booking and tracking, vessel scheduling and stowage, equipment tracking, customer service, banking, payroll and employee communication systems. Despite our continuous efforts to make investments in our information technology systems, the implementation of security measures to protect our data and infrastructure against breaches and other cyber threats, and our use of internal processes and controls designed to protect the security and availability of our systems, our information technology and communication systems may be vulnerable to cybersecurity risks faced by other large companies in our industry. Our systems may be susceptible to computer viruses, hacking, malware, denial of service attacks, cyber terrorism, circumvention of security systems, malfeasance, breaches due to employee error, natural disasters, telecommunications failure, or other catastrophic events at the Company\u2019s facilities, aboard its vessels or at third-party locations. Any failure, breach or unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s or third-party systems could result in the loss of confidential, sensitive or proprietary information, interruptions in its service or production or otherwise impact our ability to conduct business operations, and could result in potential reductions in revenue and profits, damage to its reputation or liability.\nLoss of the Company\u2019s key personnel could adversely affect its business.\nThe Company\u2019s future success will depend, in significant part, upon the continued services of its key personnel, including its senior management and skilled employees. The loss of the services of key personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s future operating results because of such employees\u2019 experience and knowledge of the Company\u2019s business and customer relationships. If key employees depart, the Company may have to incur significant costs to replace them, and the Company\u2019s ability to execute its business model could be impaired if it cannot replace them in a timely manner. The Company does not maintain key person insurance on any of its key personnel.\nThe Company is involved in a joint venture and is subject to risks associated with joint venture relationships.\nThe Company is involved in a terminal joint venture, SSAT, and may initiate future joint venture projects. A joint venture involves certain risks such as:\n\u00b7 The Company may not have voting control over the joint venture;\n\u00b7 The Company may not be able to maintain good relationships with its joint venture partner;\n\u00b7 The joint venture partner at any time may have economic or business interests that are inconsistent with the Company\u2019s;\n\u00b7 The joint venture partner may fail to fund its share of capital for operations or to fulfill its other commitments, including providing accurate and timely accounting and financial information to the Company;\n\u00b7 The joint venture may experience operating difficulties and financial losses, which may lead to asset write-downs or impairment charges that could negatively impact the operating results of the joint venture and the Company;\n\u00b7 The joint venture or venture partner could lose key personnel; and\n\u00b7 The joint venture partner could become bankrupt requiring the Company to assume all risks and capital requirements related to the joint venture project, and the related bankruptcy proceedings could have an adverse impact on the operation of the partnership or joint venture.\nIn addition, the Company relies on the terminal joint venture, SSAT, and SSA for its stevedoring services on the U.S. West Coast. The Company could be adversely affected by any changes in the services provided, or to the costs of such services provided by the Company\u2019s terminal joint venture, SSAT, and SSA.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with conducting business in foreign shipping markets.\nMatson\u2019s China, Micronesia and South Pacific services are subject to risks associated with conducting business in a foreign shipping market, which include:\n\u00b7 Challenges associated with operating in foreign countries and doing business and developing relationships with foreign companies;\n\u00b7 Challenges in working with and maintaining good relationships with joint venture partners in our foreign operations;\n\u00b7 Difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7 U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory restrictions, including compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and foreign laws that prohibit corrupt payments to government officials;\n\u00b7 Global vessel overcapacity that may lead to decreases in volumes and shipping rates;\n\u00b7 Competition with established and new carriers;\n\u00b7 Currency exchange rate fluctuations and our ability to manage these fluctuations;\n\u00b7 Political and economic instability;\n\u00b7 Protectionist measures that may affect the Company\u2019s operation of its wholly-owned foreign enterprise; and\n\u00b7 Challenges caused by cultural differences.\nAny of these risks has the potential to adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s Logistics segment is dependent upon third parties for equipment, capacity and services essential to operate the Company\u2019s Logistics business, and if the Company fails to secure sufficient third party services, its business could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s Logistics segment is dependent upon rail, truck and ocean transportation services provided by independent third parties. If the Company cannot secure sufficient transportation equipment, capacity or services from these third parties at reasonable rates to meet its customers\u2019 needs and schedules, customers may seek to have their transportation and logistics needs met by other third parties on a temporary or permanent basis. As a result, the Company\u2019s business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe Company is subject to risks related to a marine accident or spill event.\nThe Company\u2019s vessel and terminal operations could be faced with a maritime accident, oil or other spill, or other environmental mishap. Such event may lead to personal injury, loss of life, damage of property, pollution and suspension of operations. As a result, such event could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s Shipbuilding Agreements with Aker Philadelphia Shipyard, Inc. are subject to risks.\nOn November 6, 2013, MatNav and APSI entered into definitive agreements pursuant to which APSI will construct two new 3,600-TEU Aloha-class dual-fuel capable containerships, with expected delivery dates during the third and fourth quarters of 2018. Failure of either party to the shipbuilding agreement to fulfill its obligations under the agreement could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nHeightened security measures, war, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism and other acts of violence may adversely impact the Company\u2019s operations and profitability.\nWar, terrorist attacks and other acts of violence may cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, or may affect the ability or willingness of tourists to travel to Hawaii, thereby adversely affecting Hawaii\u2019s economy and the Company. Additionally, future terrorist attacks could increase volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets. Acts of war or terrorism may be directed at the Company\u2019s shipping operations, or may cause the U.S. government to take control of Matson\u2019s vessels for military operation. Heightened security measures potentially slow the movement and increase the cost of freight through U.S. or foreign ports, across borders or on U.S. or foreign railroads or highways and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s growth strategy includes expansion through acquisitions. Acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired assets or companies, and may result in the diversion of the Company\u2019s capital and its management attention from other business issues and opportunities. The Company may not be able to integrate companies that it acquires successfully, including their personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations and general operating procedures. The Company may also encounter challenges in achieving appropriate internal control over financial reporting in connection with the integration of an acquired company. The Company may pay a premium for an acquisition, resulting in goodwill that may later be determined to be impaired, adversely affecting the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. For a discussion of risks related to the pending acquisition of the stock of Horizon Lines, Inc., see \u201cRisks Related to the Pending Acquisition of Horizon\u201d set forth below.\nRisks Relating to the Pending Acquisition of Horizon\nThe pending acquisition of Horizon is subject to conditions that may not be satisfied on a timely basis, or at all.\nThe consummation of the pending acquisition of Horizon is subject to a number of conditions that must be satisfied or waived, including, among others, the absence of a material adverse effect in connection with Horizon\u2019s non-Hawaii business and that there is no significant financial impact as a result of Horizon operating the main engines on its Alaska ships on ultra-low-sulfur fuel (Horizon announced it received an exemption from the requirement that it operate its ships on ultra-low-sulfur fuel on January 9, 2015). There can be no assurance that the conditions to closing the merger will be satisfied or that the merger will be completed.\nIf the acquisition of Horizon is not completed on a timely basis, or at all, the Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected, and the Company will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7 We may not realize any of the benefits expected from its consummation;\n\u00b7 Time and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the acquisition of Horizon (including integration planning) could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities; and\n\u00b7 The market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the acquisition of Horizon will be completed.\nThis loss of benefits, or the increase in risks, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCompletion of the Horizon acquisition is conditioned upon the consummation of Horizon\u2019s pending transaction with Pasha, which may take longer than expected or not occur at all.\nThe consummation of the Horizon Transaction is conditioned upon the completion of the Pasha Transaction. Before the Pasha Transaction may be completed, the waiting periods (and any extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended must have been terminated or expired, Pasha must have funds necessary to pay its purchase price, and other customary closing conditions must be satisfied. On January 12, 2015, Horizon and Pasha received a second request for additional information and documentary material from the U.S. Department of Justice, which has the effect of extending the waiting period until 30 days after both Horizon and Pasha have substantially complied with the second request. Although Horizon and Pasha have agreed to use their best efforts to obtain the requisite governmental approvals, there can be no assurances that these approvals will be obtained, or to the timing of such approvals.\nThe Company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Horizon acquisition, and the continuing integration process could adversely impact our ongoing operations.\nWe may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Horizon acquisition if the integration process takes longer or is more costly than expected or otherwise fails to meet our expectations. In addition, we anticipate that the overall integration of Horizon\u2019s non-Hawaii business will be a time-consuming and expensive process that could significantly disrupt our business.\nPotential difficulties and challenges we may encounter in the integration process include the following:\n\u00b7 The integration of key employees, strategies and operations;\n\u00b7 The disruption of ongoing businesses and distraction of our management team from ongoing business concerns;\n\u00b7 The creation of a need for additional compliance, documentation, risk management and internal control procedures;\n\u00b7 Costs necessary to establish and maintain effective internal controls for Horizon;\n\u00b7 Inability to maintain the key business and customer relationships of Horizon;\n\u00b7 Harm to our existing business relationships;\n\u00b7 Litigation for activities of Horizon, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;\n\u00b7 The creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems; and\n\u00b7 The integration of corporate cultures and maintenance of employee morale.\nThe acquisition of Horizon may expose us to unknown liabilities.\nFollowing the completion of the acquisition of Horizon, we will be subject to all of the liabilities of Horizon\u2019s non-Hawaii business. If there are unknown liabilities or other obligations, including contingent liabilities, our business could be materially affected. We may learn additional information about Horizon\u2019s non-Hawaii business that adversely affects us, such as unknown liabilities or other issues that could affect our ability to comply with other applicable laws. Moreover, Horizon may not be able to collect in full on its indemnification rights against Hawaii liabilities under the agreements in the Pasha Transaction.\nWe may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if recorded goodwill associated with the Horizon Acquisition becomes impaired.\nFollowing the completion of the acquisition of Horizon, we expect to record a significant intangible asset related to goodwill. We are required to test goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less that its carrying amount. Factors that could lead to an impairment of goodwill include any significant adverse changes affecting the reporting unit\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, and future cash flows.\nWe may be required to record future charges to earnings if goodwill associated with the Horizon Acquisition become impaired. Any such charge would adversely impact our financial results.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue incurring, substantial expenses related to the pending acquisition.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue incurring, substantial expenses in connection with completing the acquisition of Horizon and integrating the operations of Horizon with our operations. While we have assumed that a certain level of transaction and integration expenses would be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of our transaction and integration expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. As a result, the transaction and integration expenses associated with the acquisition of Horizon could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the integration of Horizon following the completion of the acquisition of Horizon.\nRisks Relating to Financial Matters\nA deterioration of the Company\u2019s credit profile or disruptions of the credit markets could restrict its ability to access the debt capital markets or increase the cost of debt.\nDeterioration in the Company\u2019s credit profile may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to access the private or public debt markets and also may increase its borrowing costs. If the Company\u2019s credit profile deteriorates significantly, its access to the debt\ncapital markets or its ability to renew its committed lines of credit may become restricted, or the Company may not be able to refinance debt at the same levels or on the same terms. Because the Company relies on its ability to draw on its revolving credit facilities to support its operations, when required, any volatility in the credit and financial markets that prevents the Company from accessing funds (for example, a lender that does not fulfill its lending obligation) could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, the Company\u2019s credit agreements generally include an increase in borrowing rates if the Company\u2019s credit profile deteriorates. Furthermore, the Company incurs interest under its revolving credit facilities based on floating rates. Floating rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest rates increase, which would adversely affect the Company\u2019s cash flow and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with certain restrictive financial covenants contained in the Company\u2019s credit facilities could preclude the payment of dividends, impose restrictions on the Company\u2019s business segments, capital resources or other activities or otherwise adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants, the most restrictive of which include the maintenance of minimum shareholders\u2019 equity levels, a maximum ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and the maintenance of no more than a maximum amount of priority debt as a percentage of consolidated tangible assets. If the Company does not maintain the required covenants, and that breach of covenants is not cured timely or waived by the lenders, resulting in default, the Company\u2019s access to credit may be limited or terminated, dividends may be suspended, and the lenders could declare any outstanding amounts due and payable. The Company\u2019s continued ability to borrow under its credit facilities is subject to compliance with these financial and other non-financial covenants.\nThe Company\u2019s effective income tax rate may vary.\nVarious internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable, material or immaterial effects on the Company\u2019s effective income tax rate and, therefore, the Company\u2019s net income and earnings per share. These factors include, but are not limited to changes in tax rates; changes in tax laws, regulations, and rulings; changes in interpretations of existing tax laws, regulations and rulings; changes in the Company\u2019s evaluation of collectability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions; changes in accounting principles; changes in current pre-tax income as well as changes in forecasted pre-tax income; changes in the level of CCF deductions, non-deductible expenses, and expenses eligible for tax credits; changes in the mix of earnings among countries with varying tax rates; acquisitions and changes in the Company\u2019s corporate structure. These factors may result in periodic revisions to our effective income tax rate, which could affect the Company\u2019s cash flow and results of operations.\nChanges in the value of pension assets, or a change in pension law or key assumptions, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe amount of the Company\u2019s employee pension and post-retirement benefit costs and obligations are calculated on assumptions used in the relevant actuarial calculations. Adverse changes in any of these assumptions due to economic or other factors, changes in discount rates, higher health care costs, or lower actual or expected returns on plan assets, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. In addition, a change in federal law, including changes to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation premiums, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s single-employer and multiemployer pension plans and plan funding. These factors, as well as a decline in the fair value of pension plan assets, may put upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits and may increase future pension expense and required funding contributions. There can be no assurance that it will be successful in limiting future cost and expense increases, and continued upward pressure in costs and expenses could further reduce the profitability of the Company\u2019s businesses.\nThe Company may have exposure under its multiemployer pension and post-retirement plans in which it participates that extends beyond its funding obligation with respect to the Company\u2019s employees.\nThe Company contributes to various multiemployer pension plans. In the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by the Company from any plan that is underfunded, the Company would be liable for a proportionate share of such plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits. Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which the Company cannot independently validate, the Company believes that its portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination may be material to its financial position and results of operations. If any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan that is underfunded, and such employer (or any member in its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal, then the Company, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be liable for its proportionate share of such plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits. In addition, if a multiemployer plan fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service will impose certain penalties and taxes.\nRisks Relating to Legal and Legislative Matters\nThe impact of the molasses release in September 2013 may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe Company could be faced with regulatory compliance obligations, third party or governmental agency claims, disputes, legal or other proceedings, fines, penalties, natural resource damages, inquiries or investigations or other regulatory actions in connection with the release of molasses into Honolulu Harbor in September 2013. The Company cannot currently estimate the potential impact of any such events, but such events could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matson\u2019s tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d below.\nThe Company is subject to, and may in the future be subject to, disputes, legal or other proceedings, or government inquiries or investigations, that could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nThe nature of the Company\u2019s business exposes it to the potential for disputes, legal or other proceedings, or government inquiries or investigations, relating to antitrust matters, labor and employment matters, personal injury and property damage, environmental and other matters, as discussed in the other risk factors disclosed in this section or in other Company filings with the SEC. For example, Matson is a common carrier, whose tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers are governed by extensive and complex foreign, federal, state and local regulations, which may be the subject of disputes or administrative or judicial proceedings. If these disputes develop into proceedings, these proceedings, individually or collectively, could involve or result in significant expenditures or losses by the Company, or result in significant changes to Matson\u2019s tariffs, rates, rules and practices in dealing with its customers, all of which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s future operating results, including profitability, cash flows, and financial condition. For a description of significant legal proceedings involving the Company, see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d below.\nRepeal, substantial amendment, or waiver of the Jones Act or its application could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nIf the Jones Act was to be repealed, substantially amended, or waived and, as a consequence, competitors were to enter the Hawaii or Alaska markets with lower operating costs by utilizing their ability to acquire and operate foreign-flag and foreign-built vessels, the Company\u2019s business would be adversely affected. In addition, the Company\u2019s advantage as a U.S.-citizen operator of Jones Act vessels could be eroded by periodic efforts and attempts by foreign interests to circumvent certain aspects of the Jones Act. If maritime cabotage services were included in the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the North American Free Trade Agreement or other international trade agreements, or if the restrictions contained in the Jones Act were otherwise altered, the shipping of cargo between covered U.S. ports could be opened to foreign-flag or foreign-built vessels.\nNon-compliance with, or changes to, federal, state or local law or regulations, including passage of climate change legislation or regulation, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including cabotage laws, government rate regulations, and environmental regulations including those relating to air quality initiatives at port locations, including, but not limited to, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation & Liability Act of 1980, the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, the Clean Water Act, the Invasive Species Act and the Clean Air Act. Continued compliance with these laws and regulations may result in additional costs and changes in operating procedures that may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Noncompliance with, or changes to, the laws and regulations governing the Company\u2019s business could impose significant additional costs on the Company and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes in environmental laws impacting the business, including passage of climate change legislation or other regulatory initiatives that restrict emissions of greenhouse gasses, may require costly vessel modifications, the use of higher-priced fuel and changes in operating practices that may not be recoverable through increased payments from customers. Further changes to these laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company. Climate change legislation, such as limiting and reducing greenhouse gas emissions through a \u201ccap and trade\u201d system of allowances and credits, if enacted, may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nRisks Related to Capital Structure\nThe Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected if the Company were determined not to be a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act.\nCertain provisions of the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation protect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain its status as a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act. Although the Company believes it currently is a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act, if non-U.S. citizens were able to defeat such articles of incorporation restrictions and own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Company\u2019s common stock, the Company would no longer be considered a U.S. citizen under the Jones Act. Such an event could result in the Company\u2019s ineligibility to engage in coastwise trade and the imposition of substantial penalties against it, including seizure or forfeiture of its vessels, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operation.", "PERMNO": 11691, "SIC": 4400, "TIC": "MATX"}
