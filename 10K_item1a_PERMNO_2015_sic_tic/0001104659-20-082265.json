{"cik": "1711012", "company": "Senmiao Technology Ltd", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-07-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our company is subject to a high degree of risk. The risk factors described below and similar risk factors we may face are important to understanding other statements in this Report and should be reviewed carefully. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nOur business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.\nBecause of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting our financial condition and operating results, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe voluntarily assumed all the outstanding loans due to the investors on our online lending platform for our discontinued Online Lending Services but may not have enough cash to pay for the liabilities.\nOn October 17, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a plan submitted by management to wind down and discontinue our online P2P lending business. In connection with the plan, we have ceased facilitation of loan transactions on our online lending platform and voluntarily assumed all the outstanding loans due to the investors on the platform since October 17, 2019. As of the date of this Report, the aggregate balance of the loans we assumed was approximately $5.6 million.\nThere is no regulation or law in China which requires the online lending platform to take the responsibility on behalf of the borrowers to pay for investors. Pursuant to the Notice on the Risks of Online Lending Industry issued by the Leading Group Office of Online Lending Risk Response of Sichuan on December 4, 2019, any disputes between investors and a P2P online lending platform, investors and borrowers, and between borrowers and a P2P online lending platform can be resolved through legal actions, such as conciliation, application for arbitration and litigation. In common practice, in order to protect the rights of investors and avoid further conflicts, certain online lending platforms, such as Mintou Financial Service in Shenzhen and Juyouqian in Beijing, have decided to take responsibility to pay the outstanding balance due to investors.\nAs of March 31, 2020, we have used cash generated from our Automobile Transaction and Related Services and payments collected from borrowers in the aggregate of approximately $1.9 million to repay our platform investors. Based on recent repayments collected from borrowers, we also recognized bad debt expenses of approximately $3.7 million for those receivables. We expect to make 90% of repayment due to investors by December 31, 2021.\nHowever, if we could not generate enough cash flow to pay investors on time in accordance with the plan, we may incur additional commitment liabilities before we fully fulfill the commitment. The amount and timing of the actual allowance for bad debt may change based on collectability of the subject loans during the execution of the plan.\nWe face intense competition, which may lead to loss of market share, reduced service fees and revenue, increased expenses, departures of qualified employees, and disputes with competitors.\nWe face intense competition in the automobile transaction and financing industry. Our competitors may have significantly more resources than we do, including financial, technological, marketing and others and may be able to devote greater resources to the development and promotion of their services. As a result, they may have deeper relationships with automobile dealers, automobile financing partners and other third-party service providers than we do. This could allow them to develop new services, adapt more quickly to changes in technology and to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, which may render our services less attractive to consumers and cause us to lose market share. Moreover, intense competition in the markets we operate in may reduce our service fees and revenue, increase our operating expenses and capital expenditures, and lead to departures of our qualified employees. We may also be harmed by negative publicity instigated by our competitors, regardless of its validity. We may in the future continue to encounter disputes with our competitors, including lawsuits involving claims asserted under unfair competition laws and defamation which may adversely affect our business and reputation. Failure to compete with current and potential competitors could materially harm our business, financial condition and our results of operations.\nOur relationship with Didi, a leading Chinese ride-hailing service platform, third party sales teams and financing partners is crucial to our ability to grow our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur strategic relationship with Didi, a leading ride-hailing service platform in China, is crucial to our business as most of the cars we provide services to are used as ride-hailing vehicles for Didi. Our cooperative arrangement with Didi is on a non-exclusive basis, and Didi may have cooperative arrangements with our competitors. If our collaboration with Didi was terminated, we may not be able to maintain our existing customers or attract new customers who are and will be Didi drivers, which could materially and adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operations.\nWe also cooperate with third party sales teams, automobile dealers and financial institutions and others to provide automobile transaction and financing services. Our ability to acquire consumers depends on our own marketing efforts through online advertising and billboard advertising, as well as the network of different third party sales teams. Our ability to attract and maintain customers also depends on whether our financing partners provide timely and sufficient funding to automobile purchase. We intend to strengthen relationships with existing financing partners and develop new relationships for our automobile transaction and financing business. If we are not able to attract or retain cooperative third party sales teams or financing partners as new business partners on acceptable terms, our business growth will be hindered and our results of operations and financial condition will suffer.\nUnder the terms of the JKL Investment Agreement, we may be required to sell Jinkailong or take it public in the future, and failing that, or if other redemption triggers occur, we may be required to participate in a repurchase of the investor\u2019s interest in Jinkailong.\nOn July 4, 2020, we entered into the JKL Investment Agreement with Jinkailong\u2019s other shareholders and Hongyi, pursuant to which Hongyi agreed to subscribe a 27.03% equity interest of Jinkailong for a consideration of RMB 50 million (approximately $7 million) with the payments to be made in tranches. The JKL Investment Agreement provides Hongyi certain shareholder rights, including a redemption right which provides that the other shareholders of Jinkailong may be required to purchase Hongyi\u2019s equity interest in Jinkailong in the event that Jinkailong (i) fails to become public through an IPO for a valuation of no less than RMB350 million (approximately $49.5 million) or merge with a public company for a valuation of no less than RMB300 million (approximately $42.5 million) within the six months following the performance commitment period, (ii) fails to achieve an accumulated net profit of RMB24 million (approximately $3.4 million) for the first two years of the performance commitment period or a net profit of RMB20 million (approximately $2.9 million) for the third year of the performance commitment period, or (iii) has any material and adverse change to its core business, including but not limited to being included in the list of dishonest persons and loss of over one third of its online ride-hailing taxi operating licenses, as well as bankruptcy, liquidation or cessation of operations, Hongyi shall have the right to require certain shareholders of Jinkailong (including Hunan Ruixi) to repurchase all of its equity interest in Jinkailong. Based on a repurchase formula provided for in the JKL Investment Agreement, the maximum repurchase amount that Hunan Ruixi would be subject to is RMB28,320,000 (approximately $4.0 million).\nThere is no assurance that Jinkailong will be able to become listed or merged with a public company with the stipulated valuation within the timeframe provided in the JKL Investment Agreement, and even if we are forced into such transactions, there is a risk that such merger or going public event might not be in the interests of our shareholders at that time. Moreover, there is a risk if such merger or going public event does not occur, or that the other redemption triggers occur, we may be required to participate in the repurchase Hongyi\u2019s equity interest in the future. We may not have the funds to participate in such redemption at the required time, which would leave us subject to claims of breach of contract by Hongyi or force to us to raise new funding to meet our obligations, which funding might not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nMoreover, our ability to dispose of our equity interest in Jinkailong is restricted. Specifically, under the JKL Investment Agreement, we are prohibited from disposing of our equity interest in Jinkailong until six months after the performance commitment period. These limitations could further prevent us from obtain the funding necessary to meet our redemption obligations under the JKL Investment Agreement.\nOur business operations have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).\nAn outbreak of respiratory illness caused by COVID-19 emerged in China in late 2019 and has expanded within the rest of China and globally. Our principal operations are located in China. COVID-19 is considered to be highly contagious and poses a serious public health threat. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, expanding its assessment of the threat beyond the global health emergency it had announced in January 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has materially and adversely affected the global economy, our markets in China and our business. Restrictions on the movement of people and goods in certain regions may require us to adjust certain of our service processes in the future. Our offices in Chengdu, Sichuan and Changsha, Hunan were closed from late January 2020 to late February, 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. A prolonged outbreak of COVID-19 could result in decrease of client demand for our services, restrictions on our travel to support our clients, and delays in our services. All these factors adversely impacted our results of operations during our fourth fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2020 and may adversely affect our business and results of operations during 2020 and beyond, although we cannot quantify the overall impact at this time.\nWe cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 will continue to be effectively contained in China, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its impact. If the outbreak of COVID-19 is not effectively and timely controlled, our business operations and financial condition may continue to be materially and adversely affected as a result of the deteriorating market outlook, the slowdown in regional and national economic growth, weakened liquidity and financial condition of our customers and other factors that we cannot foresee. Any of these factors and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the overall business environment, cause uncertainties in the regions in China where we conduct business, cause our business to suffer in ways that we cannot predict and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not have written agreements in place with certain financing partners and adverse change in our relationship with such financing partners may materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on a limited number of financing partners to fund automobile transactions for automobile purchasers. However, we do not have written agreements in place with these financing partners obligating them to provide financing. For example, one of our top financing partners has been funding the automobile purchases by purchasers referred by us through an agreement with a related party of Jinkailong. Because such financing partners are not contractually bound by any specific commitment to provide financing, they may determine not to collaborate with us or limit the funding that is available for financing transactions we facilitate, which will materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customers\u2019 failure to fully comply with PRC taxi-related laws may expose us to potential penalties and negatively affect our operations.\nAccording to the guidelines issued by the Municipal Communications Commission of Chengdu in November 2016, online reservation taxi operating license, automobile certificate and online reservation taxi driver\u2019s license are required to operate the online ride-hailing business. Approximately 5% of the automobiles used for online ride-hailing that are affiliated with us do not have the automobile certificates and approximately 68% of our ride-hailing drivers have not obtained the online reservation taxi driver\u2019s licenses as of March 31, 2020. We are in the process of assisting the drivers to obtain the required certificate and license. However, there is no guarantee that all of the drivers affiliated without us would be able to obtain all the certificate and license. Our ability and method to provide the automobile transaction related services might be affected or restricted if our affiliated drivers or automobiles do not possess the requisite license. Our business and results of operations will be materially affected if our affiliated drivers are suspended from providing ride-hailing services or imposed substantial fines.\nWe advance payments for over 90% of the automobile purchases for our customers and we can provide no assurances that our current financial resources will be adequate to support this operation.\nWe prepay all the purchase price and expenses on behalf of the automobile purchasers when we provide purchase services and collect all the advance payment and relevant services fees from the proceeds disbursed by the financial institutions upon the closing of the financing and/or when the monthly installment payment made by automobile purchasers during the lease term. As of March 31, 2020, we had advanced payments of approximately RMB12.3 million (approximately $1.7 million) for the automobile purchases. We funded those advance payments by proceeds of our initial public offering, the June 2019 Offering, loans from financial institutions and capital contributions from shareholders.\nOur liquidity may be negatively impacted as a result of the increases in advance payments for automobile purchases in addition to general economic and industry factors. We anticipate that, to the extent that we require additional liquidity, it will be funded through the incurrence of other indebtedness, additional equity financings or a combination of these potential sources of liquidity. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or convertible debt, our stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, would result in increased fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. The covenants under future credit facilities may limit our ability to obtain additional debt financing. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Any failure to raise capital in the future could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nOur failure to raise additional capital and in sufficient amounts may significantly impact our ability to maintain and expand our business.\nPrior consent from financial institutions which provided financing to our online ride-hailing driver customers for the purchase of automobiles has not been obtained for us to sublease or sell the drivers\u2019 automobiles.\nAs described in the section titled \u201cBusiness\u201d above, due to the intense competition and the COVID-19 pandemic, during the year ended March 31, 2020, certain ride-hailing drivers (primarily in Chengdu, our principal area of operations in China) exited the online ride-hailing business and tendered their purchased automobile to us for sublease or sales in order to offset monthly payment owed to us and the financial institutions. Their Financing Agreements with the financial institutions are still valid and in effect. Pursuant to the Financing Agreements, the right of the automobile collateral to the financial institution belongs to the financial institution and without their consent, we may not dispose of, use, or take possession of those automobiles. To prevent the default in payments to the financial institutions and us, the drivers authorized us orally or in writing to sublease or sell the automobiles to other parties, and use the cash generated from the sublease or sales to cover the monthly installment payments to the financial institution and the monthly installment service fees as well as the automobile registration related fees that we previously advanced during the remaining original lease terms to us. As prior consent from the financial institutions have not been obtained, the financial institutions may require us to stop sublease and return the automobiles immediately. We may also be required to pay penalties to the financial institutions. Although we have not received any demand from any financial institution to stop the sublease practice, there is no assurance that future demand to stop such practice may not come along; if so, we may experience economic loss and reputation damage as a result.\nJinkailong uses the bank accounts of its related parties for daily operations and inability to use such accounts may have an adverse impact on our operations.\nJinkailong has been using the bank accounts of its shareholder or companies owned by its shareholders (other than us) to receive and remit payments during its daily operations. Jinkailong has authorization from these related parties to use the bank accounts and has designated its own accounting staff to manage such accounts. However, if owners of the bank accounts revoke their authorization, prohibit or limit Jinkailong\u2019s access to the bank accounts, we may not receive payments timely or at all from financial institutions or the automobile purchasers, which may adversely affect our operations. Jinkailong may lose all or part of the funds in the accounts in the event that such accounts are subject to creditor\u2019s claims and frozen or closed by court order.\nWe may need additional capital to pursue business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, and financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe have been financing our Automobile Transaction and Related Services through borrowing from third parties and related parties and proceeds from our IPO and follow-on public offering. As we intend to continue to make investments to support the growth of our automobile business, we may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, including developing new solutions and services, increasing the amount of financing transactions we facilitate, further enhance our risk management capabilities, increasing our sales and marketing expenditures to improve brand awareness and engage automobile purchasers through expanded online channels, enhancing our operating infrastructure and acquiring complementary businesses and technologies. We plan to expand our Automobile Transaction and Related Services, and we may need to make additional capital contribution as a result. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. However, additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Repayment of the debts may divert a substantial portion of cash flow to repay principal and service interest on such debt, which would reduce the funds available for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; and we may suffer default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating cash flow is insufficient to service debt obligations, which could in turn result in acceleration of obligations to repay the indebtedness and limit our sources of financing.\nVolatility in the credit markets may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing shareholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur automobile financing facilitation services may subject us to regulatory and reputational risks, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe provide automobile financing facilitation services to finance consumers\u2019 car purchases. The PRC laws and regulations concerning financial services are evolving and the PRC government authorities may promulgate new laws and regulations in the future. We cannot assure you that our practices would not be deemed to violate any PRC laws or regulations either now or in the future. The financing products of our financial partners referred by us may be deemed to exceed the stipulated cap on the financing amount relative to the car purchase price, in which case we may be required to make adjustments to our cooperation arrangements or cease to cooperate with these financing partners. If we are required to make adjustments to our automobile financing facilitation referral business model or withdraw, discontinue or change some of our automobile financing facilitation referral services, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if the financing products referred by us and our cooperation with financing partners were to be deemed as in violation of applicable PRC laws or regulations, our reputation would suffer.\nMoreover, developments in the financial service industry may lead to changes in PRC laws, regulations and policies or in the interpretation and application of existing laws, regulations and policies, which may limit or restrict consumer financing or related facilitation services like those we offer. We may, from time to time, be required to adjust our arrangement with third-party financing partners, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we cannot rule out the possibility that the PRC government will institute a new licensing regime covering services we provide in the future. If such a licensing regime were introduced, we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain any newly required license in a timely manner, or at all, which could materially and adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operations.\nWe are exposed to credit risk in our auto financing facilitation and auto financing businesses. Our current risk management system may not be able to accurately assess and mitigate all risks to which we are exposed, including credit risk.\nWe are exposed to credit risk as we provide automobile financing facilitation to automobile purchasers and are required to provide guarantees to most of our financing partners on the financing for automobile purchases facilitated by us. As of March 31, 2020, the maximum contingent liabilities we would be exposed to was approximately $18.6 million, assuming all the automobile purchasers were in default, and for the year ended March 31, 2020, we recognized estimated provisions loss of approximately $225,000 for the guarantee services as a result of default by the automobile purchasers. Customers may default on their lease/loan payments for a number of reasons including those outside of their or our control. The credit risk may be exacerbated in automobile financing due to the relatively limited credit history and other available information of many consumers in China.\nIf we are unable to repossess the car collateral for delinquent financing payments of the automobile purchasers referred by us or do so in a cost-effective manner or if our ability to collect delinquent financing payments is impaired, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. We may also be subject to risks relating to third-party debt collection service providers who we engage for the recovery and collection of loans.\nUnder most of the Financing agreements between the automobile purchasers and third-party financing partners, we guarantee the lease/loan payments including principal and the accrued and unpaid interest for the automobile purchase funded by these financing partners. Therefore, failure to collect lease/loan payments or to repossess the collateral may have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial positions. Although the lease/loan payments are secured by the cars, we may not be able to repossess the car collateral when our customers default. Our measures to track the cars include installing GPS trackers on cars. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully locate and recover the car collateral. We have in the past failed to repossess one car as the GPS trackers failed to function properly or had been disabled, and we cannot assure you that this incident will not happen again the future. We also cannot assure you that there will not be regulatory changes that prohibit the installation of GPS trackers, or the realized value of the repossessed cars will be sufficient to cover our customers' payment obligations. If we cannot repossess some of these cars or the residual values of the repossessed cars are lower than we expected and not sufficient to cover the automobile purchaser' payment obligation, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nMoreover, the current regulatory regime for debt collection in the PRC remains unclear. We aim to ensure our collection efforts carried out by our asset management department comply with the relevant laws and regulations in the PRC. However, if our collection methods are viewed by the automobile purchasers or regulatory authorities as harassments, threats or other illegal means, we may be subject to risks relating to our collection practice, including lawsuits initiated by the borrowers or prohibition from using certain collection methods by the regulatory authorities. Any perception that our collection practices are aggressive and not compliant with the relevant laws and regulations in the PRC may result in harm to our reputation and business, decrease in the willingness of prospective customers to apply for and utilize our service, or fines and penalties imposed by the relevant regulatory authorities, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to enforce our rights against our automobile purchaser clients.\nWe offer automobile purchasers desiring to enter the ride-hailing business in our areas of operation in China various value-added services associated with purchasing a car with financing. Such services include, among others, credit assessment, preparation of financing application materials, assistance with closing of financing transactions, license and plate registration, payment of taxes and fees, purchase of insurance, installment of GPS devices, ride-hailing driver qualification and other administrative procedures. We charge automobile purchaser fees for such services, but we do not enter into agreements with such automobile purchaser regarding the provision and payment of the purchase services. In the event a legal dispute arises between the purchaser and us, we may not be able to enforce our rights against the purchaser, which may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nWe are required to obtain certain licenses and permits in China for our business operations, and we may not be able to obtain or maintain such licenses or permits.\nWe may be deemed to operate financing guarantee business by the PRC regulatory authorities. Under certain arrangements in our services, we provide guarantees to our customers who apply for financing with certain of our financing partners. In August, 2017, the PRC State Council promulgated the Regulations on the Administration of Financing Guarantee Companies (the \u201cFinancing Guarantee Rules\u201d), which became effective on October 1, 2017. Pursuant to the Financing Guarantee Rules, \u201cfinancing guarantee\u201d refers to the activities in which guarantors provide guarantee to the guaranteed parties as to loans, bonds or other types of debt financing, and \u201cfinancing guarantee companies\u201d refer to companies legally established and operating financing guarantee business. According to the Financing Guarantee Rules, the establishment of financing guarantee companies are subject to the approval by the relevant governmental authority, and unless otherwise stipulated, no entity may operate financing guarantee business without such approval.\nWe do not believe that the Financing Guarantee Rules apply to our car financing facilitation business as we provide guarantees to our financing partners in connection with the financing of the purchase of automobiles and such guarantees are not provided independently as our principal business. However, due to the lack of further interpretations, the exact definition and scope of \u201coperating financing guarantee business\u201d under the Financing Guarantee Rules is unclear. It is uncertain whether we would be deemed to operate financing guarantee business in violation of relevant PRC laws or regulations because of our current arrangements with certain financial institutions. If the relevant regulatory authorities determine that we are operating financing guarantee business, we may be required to obtain approval or license for financing guarantee business to continue our collaboration arrangement with certain financial institutions.\nIn addition, based on our current business model, we prepay the purchase price of automobiles and all service related expenses and collect the advance payment (without any interest) through monthly installment payments from the automobile purchaser.\nPursuant to Provisions on Several Questions Concerning the Application of Law in the Trial of Private Lending Cases released by the Supreme People's Court in June 2015, private lending refers to the act of financing between natural persons, legal persons and other organizations and among them. According to the Approval on How to Confirm the Effectiveness of Lending Behavior between Citizens and Enterprises issued by the PRC Supreme People\u2019s Court in 1999, the private lending refers to the lending between citizens and non-financial enterprises (hereinafter referred to as enterprises). As long as all parties' declaration of intention is true, it can be recognized as valid (the \u201cPrivate Lending Rules\u201d).\nWe do not believe that the Private Lending Rules apply to our automobile purchase services business as we need to pay in advance to different suppliers to complete our services such as preparation of financing application materials, assistance with closing of financing transactions, license and plate registration, payment of taxes and fees, purchase of insurance, installment of GPS devices, ride-hailing driver qualification and other administrative procedures. We have no intention to lend money to and gain interest from automobile purchasers. We collect payments in a period longer than 12 months based on current product designs.\nHowever, it is uncertain whether we would be deemed to operate private lending business in violation of relevant PRC laws or regulations because we prepay on behalf of automobile purchasers and collect payments over a period of more than 12 months. If the relevant regulatory authorities determine that we are operating private lending business, we may be penalized for engaging in businesses out of the scope of our business license. Pursuant to the Regulations on the Registration of Enterprise Legal Persons, we may be given warnings, fined, confiscated of illegal income, required to suspension and rectification, or our business license might be withheld and revoked by relevant regulatory authorities.\nConsequently, we may be required to obtain approval or license for financing business to continue our current collection method of payments. If we are no longer able to maintain our current collection method of payments, or become subject to penalties, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur failure to sell cars that we purchased from dealers may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn January 2019, we started to purchase automobiles from automotive dealers for sales. We primarily purchase automobile models that are reliable, affordable and based on the preference of Didi, feedback from and market analysis as to perception and demand for such models, and that will appeal to car buyers in lower-tier cities. We price automobiles based on our automotive transaction data associated with providing automotive transaction services. We have limited experience in the purchase of automobiles for sale to purchasers, and there is no assurance that we will be able to do so effectively. Demand for the type of automobiles that we purchase can change significantly between the time the automobiles are purchased and the date of sale. Demand may be affected by new automobile launches, changes in the pricing of such automobiles, defects, changes in consumer preference and other factors, and dealers may not purchase them in the quantities that we expect. We may also need to adopt more aggressive pricing strategies for these cars than originally anticipated. We also face inventory risk in connection with the automobiles purchased, including the risk of inventory obsolescence, a decline in values, and significant inventory write-downs or write-offs. If we were to adopt more aggressive pricing strategies, our profit margin may be negatively affected as well. We may also face increasing costs associated with the storage of these automobiles. Any of the above may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe assist automobile purchasers in obtaining financing from financing institutions, which may constitute provision of intermediary service, and our agreements with these financial institutions may be deemed as intermediation contracts under the PRC Contract Law.\nWe assist automobile purchasers in obtaining financing from financing institutions, which may constitute an intermediary service, and such services may be deemed as intermediation contracts under the PRC Contract Law. Under the PRC Contract Law, an intermediary may not claim for service fee and is liable for damages if it conceals any material fact intentionally or provides false information in connection with the conclusion of an intermediation contract, which results in harm to the client\u2019s interests. Therefore, if we fail to provide material information to financial institutions, or if we fail to identify false information received from automobile purchasers or others and in turn provide such information to financial institutions, and in either case if we are also found to be at fault, due to failure or deemed failure to exercise proper care, such as to conduct adequate information verification or employee supervision, we could be held liable for damage caused to financial institutions as an intermediary pursuant to the PRC Contract Law. In addition, if we fail to complete our obligations under the agreements entered into with financial institutions, we could also be held liable for damages caused to financial institutions pursuant to the PRC Contract Law.\nIf data provided by automobile purchasers and other third-party sources or collected by us are inaccurate, incomplete or fraudulent, the accuracy of our credit assessment could be compromised, customer trust in us could decline, and our business, financial position and results of operations would be harmed.\nChina\u2019s credit infrastructure is still at an early stage of development. The Credit Reference Center established by the PBOC in 2002 has been the only credit reporting system in China. This centrally managed nationwide credit database operated by the Credit Reference Center only records limited credit information, such as tax payments, civil lawsuits, foreclosures and bankruptcies. Moreover, this credit database is only accessible to banks and a limited number of market players authorized by the Credit Reference Center and does not support sophisticated credit scoring and assessment. In 2015, the PBOC announced that it would open the credit reporting market to private sectors with a view to spurring competition and innovation, but it may be a long-term process to establish a widely-applicable, reliable and sophisticated credit infrastructure in the market we operate.\nFor the purpose of credit assessment, we obtain credit information from prospective automobile buyers, and with their authorization, obtain credit data from external parties to assess applicants\u2019 creditworthiness. We may not be able to source credit data from such external parties at a reasonable cost or at all. Such credit data may have limitations in measuring prospective automobile purchasers\u2019 creditworthiness. If there is an adverse change in the economic condition, credit data provided by external parties may no longer be a reliable reference to assess an applicant\u2019s creditworthiness, which may compromise our risk management capabilities. As a result, our assessment of an automobile purchaser\u2019s credit profile may not reflect that particular car buyer\u2019s actual creditworthiness because assessment may be based on outdated, incomplete or inaccurate information.\nTo the extent that automobile purchasers provide inaccurate or fraudulent information to us, or the data provided by third-party sources is outdated, inaccurate or incomplete, our credit evaluation may not accurately reflect the associated credit risks of automobile purchasers. Among other things, we rely on data from external sources, such as the personal credit report from PBOC. These checks may fail and fraud may occur as we may fail to discover or reveal fake documents or identities used by fraudulent automobile purchasers. Additionally, once we have obtained an automobile purchaser's information, the automobile purchaser may subsequently (i) become delinquent in the payment of an outstanding obligation; (ii) default on a pre-existing debt obligation; (iii) take on additional debt; or (iv) experience other adverse financial events, making the information we previously obtained inaccurate. We also collect car collateral location data by installing GPS trackers for lease/loan payment monitoring purposes. The location data we collected may not be accurate. As a result, our ability to repossess the car collateral could be severely impaired. If we are unable to collect the lease/loan payments we facilitated or repossess the car collateral due to inaccurate or fraudulent information, our results of operations and profitability would be harmed.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims if people or property are harmed by vehicles purchased through us.\nVehicles purchased through us may be defectively designed or manufactured. As a result, we may be exposed to product liability claims relating to personal injury or property damage. Third parties subject to such injury or damage may bring claims or legal proceedings against us because we facilitate the financing/purchase of the product. Although we would have legal recourse against the automobile manufacturers or dealers under PRC law, attempting to enforce our rights against the automobile manufacturers or dealers may be expensive, time-consuming and ultimately futile. In addition, we do not currently maintain any third-party liability insurance or product liability insurance in relation to vehicles purchased through us. As a result, any material product liability claim or litigation could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds and managerial efforts in defending them and could have a negative impact on our reputation.\nIf the ride-hailing drivers engage in, or are subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, our ability to attract and retain new customers may be harmed, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe are not able to control or predict the actions of the ride-hailing drivers and third parties, either during the process of providing services or otherwise. Such actions may result in injuries, property damage, or loss of life for passengers and third parties, or business interruption, brand and reputational damage, or significant liabilities for us. Our screen and evaluation of the drivers may not expose all potentially relevant information and may fail to disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility. In addition, we do not independently test drivers\u2019 driving skills.\nIf the ride-hailing drivers engage in criminal activity, misconduct, or inappropriate conduct, and we may receive negative press coverage as a result of our business relationship with such drivers, which would adversely impact our brands, reputation, and business. There have been numerous incidents and allegations of Didi drivers sexually assaulting, abusing, and kidnapping consumers, or otherwise engaging in criminal activity. If other criminal, inappropriate, or other negative incidents occur due to the conduct of ride-hailing drivers or third parties, our ability to attract customers may be harmed, and our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nFurther, we may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, deaths, injuries, or other incidents that are caused by ride-hailing drivers, consumers, or third parties. Our auto liability and general liability insurance policies may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liabilities. These incidents may subject us to liability and negative publicity, which would increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business, operating results, and future prospects. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we will incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them.\nGovernment policies on automobile purchases and ownership may materially affect our results of operations.\nGovernment policies on automobile purchases and ownership may have a material effect on our business due to their influence on consumer behaviors. Since 2009, the PRC government has changed the purchase tax on automobiles with 1.6 liter or smaller engines several times. In addition, in August 2014, several PRC governmental authorities jointly announced that from September 2014 to December 2017, purchases of new energy automobiles designated on certain catalogs will be exempted from the purchase taxes. In April 2015, several PRC governmental authorities also jointly announced that from 2016 to 2020, purchasers of new energy automobiles designated on certain catalogs will enjoy subsidies. In December 2016, relevant PRC governmental authorities further adjusted the subsidy policy for new energy automobiles. On March 26, 2019, the PRC governmental authorities updated government subsidy policy for new energy automobiles which raises the threshold for the subsidy and reduces the amount of subsidies. On April 23, 2020, relevant PRC governmental authorities issue a notice, amongst others, that the subsidy policy for new energy automobiles will be extended to the end of 2022, while the amount of subsidies will be reduced year by year. We cannot predict whether government subsidies will remain in the future or whether similar incentives will be introduced, and if they are, their impact on automobile retail transactions in China. It is possible that automobile retail transactions may decline significantly upon expiration of the existing government subsidies if consumers have become used to such incentives and delay purchase decisions in the absence of new incentives. If automobile retail transactions indeed decline, our revenues may fluctuate and our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nSome local governmental authorities also issued regulations and relevant implementation rules in order to control urban traffic and the number of automobiles within particular urban areas. For example, local Beijing governmental authorities adopted regulations and relevant implementing rules in December 2010 to limit the total number of license plates issued to new automobile purchases in Beijing each year. Local Guangzhou governmental authorities also announced similar regulations, which came into effect in July 2013. There are similar policies that restrict the issuance of new automobile license plates in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Guiyang and Shenzhen. In September 2013, the State Council released a plan for the prevention and remediation of air pollution, which requires large cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, to further restrict the number of motor vehicles. In March 2018, the Beijing government issued an additional regulation to limit the total number of vehicles in Beijing to no more than 6.1 million, 6.2 million and 6.3 million by the end of 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. We cannot assure you that similar measures will not be adopted in Sichuan and Hunan Provinces. Such regulatory developments, as well as other uncertainties, may adversely affect the growth prospects of China\u2019s automobile industry, which in turn may have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe ride-hailing service market is still in a relatively early stage of growth with intense competition in metropolitan cities in China and if such market does not continue to grow, grow more slowly than we expect or fail to grow as large as we expect, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAccording to the Chinese Academy of Industry Economy Research Institute, the ride-hailing service market in China has grown rapidly since 2015. However, it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow, if at all. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of people to widely-adopt ride-hailing. If the public does not perceive ridesharing as beneficial, or chooses not to adopt it as a result of concerns regarding safety, affordability or for other reasons, whether as a result of incidents on the ride-hailing service platform or otherwise, then the ride-hailing service market may not further develop, or may develop more slowly than we expect or may not achieve the growth potential we expect, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to risks related to China's automobile leasing and financing industry, including industry-wide and macroeconomic risks.\nWe operate in China\u2019s automobile leasing and financing industry. We cannot assure you that this market will continue to grow rapidly in the future. Further, the growth of China\u2019s automobile leasing and financing industry could be affected by many factors, including:\n\u00b7 general economic conditions in China and around the world;\n\u00b7 the growth of disposable household income and the availability and cost of credit available to finance car purchases;\n\u00b7 the growth of China's automobile industry;\n\u00b7 taxes and other incentives or disincentives related to car purchases and ownership;\n\u00b7 environmental concerns and measures taken to address these concerns;\n\u00b7 the cost of energy, including gasoline prices, and the cost of car license plates in various cities with license plate lottery or auction systems in China;\n\u00b7 the improvement of the highway system and availability of parking facilities;\n\u00b7 other government policies relating to automobile leasing and financing in China;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in the sales and price of new and used cars;\n\u00b7 consumer acceptance of financing car purchases;\n\u00b7 changes in demographics and preferences of car purchasers;\n\u00b7 ride sharing, transportation networks, and other fundamental changes in transportation pattern; and\n\u00b7 other industry-wide issues, including supply and demand for cars and supply chain challenges.\nAny adverse change to these factors could reduce demand for used cars and hence demand for our services, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nFraudulent activity in our Automobile Transaction and Related Services could negatively impact our operating results, brand and reputation and cause the use of our loan products and services to decrease.\nWe are subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with users and third parties handling user information. Our resources, technologies and fraud detection tools may be insufficient to accurately detect and prevent fraud. Significant increases in fraudulent activity could negatively impact our brands and reputation, reduce the automobile transactions facilitated through us and lead us to take additional steps to reduce fraud risk, which could increase our costs. High profile fraudulent activity could even lead to regulatory intervention, and may divert our management's attention and cause us to incur additional expenses and costs. Although we have not experienced any material business or reputational harm as a result of fraudulent activities in the past, we cannot rule out the possibility that any of the foregoing may occur causing harm to our business or reputation in the future. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our results of operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected. We have incurred net losses and may continue to incur net losses in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses and may continue to incur net losses in the future.\nWe had net losses of $9,935,802 and $4,542,525 in the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and may continue to incur losses in the future. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we seek to continue to grow our business, attract more customers and further enhance and develop our Automobile Transaction and Related Services. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. Our net revenue growth may slow, our net income margins may decline or we may incur additional net losses in the future and may not be able to achieve and maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, our net revenue growth rate will likely decline as our net revenue grows to higher levels.\nWe may need additional capital, and financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nIn the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds from our IPO, the June 2019 Offering, capital contribution from our stockholders and borrowings from financial institutions. As of March 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $844,027, compared with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $5,020,510 as of March 31, 2019. With the proceeds from our June 2019 Offering and anticipated cash flows from operating activities, we have been able to meet our anticipated working capital requirements and capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business to the date of the Report. If we fail to do so due to unexpected situations, we anticipate to receive loans from our stockholders to fund our operations. However, we cannot assure you this will be the case. We may need additional cash resources in the future if we experience changes in business conditions or other developments. We may also need additional cash resources in the future if we find and wish to pursue opportunities for investment, acquisition, capital expenditure or similar actions. If we determine that our cash requirements exceed the amount of cash and cash equivalents we have on hand at the time, we may seek to issue equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities. The issuance and sale of additional equity would result in further dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nFluctuations in interest rates could negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe charge service fees to automobile purchasers for facilitating financing transactions. If prevailing market interest rates increase, automobile purchasers would be less likely to finance automobile purchases with credit or we may need to reduce our service fees to mitigate the impact of increased interest rates. If we do not sufficiently lower our service fees and keep our fees competitive in such instances, automobile purchasers may decide not to utilize our services because of our less competitive service fees and may take advantage of lower service fees offered by other companies, and our ability to attract prospective automobile purchasers as well as our competitive position may be severely undermined. On the other hand, if prevailing market interest rates decline, the operating margins of financial institutions may decrease, which may make the financial institutions less likely to finance automobile purchases. Under either circumstance, our financial condition and profitability could also be materially and adversely affected.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur quarterly results of operations, including the levels of our net revenues, expenses, net (loss)/income and other key metrics, may vary significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside of our control, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, especially given our limited operating history. Accordingly, the results for any one quarter are not necessarily an indication of future performance. Fluctuations in quarterly results may adversely affect the price of our common stock. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results include:\n\u00b7 our ability to attract new customers and maintain relationships with existing customers;\n\u00b7 our ability to maintain existing relationship with existing financing partners and establish new relationships with additional financial partners for our Automobile Transaction and Related Services;\n\u00b7 the amount of automobile financing transactions we facilitate;\n\u00b7 overdue ratios of automobile financing transactions/loans we facilitate;\n\u00b7 financial institutions\u2019 willingness and ability to fund financing transactions through us on reasonable terms;\n\u00b7 changes in our services and introduction of new products and services;\n\u00b7 the amount and timing of operating expenses related to acquiring customers and the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u00b7 our ability to manage transaction volume growth during the period;\n\u00b7 the timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses;\n\u00b7 network outages or security breaches;\n\u00b7 general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u00b7 our emphasis on customer experience instead of near-term growth; and\n\u00b7 the timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses.\nIf we fail to promote and maintain our brands in an effective and cost-efficient way, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe believe that developing and maintaining awareness of our brands effectively is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. Successful promotion of our brands and our ability to attract customers depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and the success of the channels we use to promote our services. Our efforts to build our brands have caused us to incur expenses, and it is likely that our future marketing efforts will require us to incur additional expenses. These efforts may not result in increased revenues in the immediate future or at all and, even if they do, any increases in revenues may not offset the expenses incurred. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands while incurring substantial expenses, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected, which may impair our ability to grow our business.\nAny harm to our brands or reputation or any damage to the reputation of our business partners or other third parties, or the automobile financing or ride-hailing industries in China may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nMaintaining and enhancing the recognition and reputation of our brands is critical to our business and competitiveness. Factors that are vital to this objective include but are not limited to our ability to:\n\u00b7 maintain and develop relationships with dealers, ride-hailing platforms and financial institutions;\n\u00b7 provide prospective and existing customers with superior experiences;\n\u00b7 enhance and improve our credit assessment and decision-making models;\n\u00b7 effectively manage and resolve any user complaints of financial institutions or customers; and\n\u00b7 effectively protect personal information and privacy of customers.\nAny malicious or innocent negative allegation made by the media or other parties about the foregoing or other aspects of our company, including but not limited to our management, business, compliance with law, financial conditions or prospects, whether with merit or not, could severely hurt our reputation and harm our business and operating results. As the markets for China's automobile financing and ride-hailing are new and the regulatory framework for these market is also evolving, negative publicity about these markets may arise from time to time. Negative publicity about China\u2019s automobile financing and ride-hailing industries in general may also have a negative impact on our reputation, regardless of whether we have engaged in any inappropriate activities.\nIn addition, certain factors that may adversely affect our reputation are beyond our control. Negative publicity about our partners, outsourced service providers or other counterparties, such as negative publicity about any failure by them to adequately protect the information of users, to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to otherwise meet required quality and service standards could harm our reputation. Furthermore, any negative development in any of the automobile financing or ride-hailing industries, such as bankruptcies or failures of other companies in any of this these, and especially a large number of such bankruptcies or failures, or negative perception of any of the industries as a whole, could compromise our image, undermine the trust and credibility we have established and impose a negative impact on our ability to attract new clients. Negative developments in these industries, such as widespread automobile purchaser/borrower defaults, unethical or illegal activities by industry players and/or the closure of companies providing similar services, may also lead to tightened regulatory scrutiny of these sectors and limit the scope of permissible business activities that may be conducted by us. If any of the foregoing takes place, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur reputation may be harmed if information supplied by customers is inaccurate, misleading or incomplete.\nOur customers supply a variety of information that is in the applications to financing partners. We do not verify all the information we receive from our customers, and such information may be inaccurate or incomplete. If financing partners provide funding to the automobile purchasers based on information supplied by automobile purchasers that is inaccurate, misleading or incomplete, those financing partners may not receive their expected returns and our reputation may be harmed. Moreover, inaccurate, misleading or incomplete customer information could also potentially subject us to liability as an intermediary under the PRC Contract Law. See \u201cBusiness - Regulations.\u201d\nOur operations depend on the performance of the internet infrastructure and fixed telecommunications networks in China.\nAlmost all access to the internet in China is maintained through state-owned telecommunication operators under the administrative control and regulatory supervision of the MIIT. We primarily rely on a limited number of telecommunication service providers to provide us with data communications capacity through local telecommunications lines and internet data centers to host our servers. We have limited access to alternative networks or services in the event of disruptions, failures or other problems with China's internet infrastructure or the fixed telecommunications networks provided by telecommunication service providers. With the expansion of our business, we may be required to upgrade our technology and infrastructure to keep up with the requirements of our operations. We cannot assure you that the internet infrastructure and the fixed telecommunications networks in China will be able to support the demands associated with the continued growth in internet usage.\nIn addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by telecommunication service providers. If the prices we pay for telecommunications and internet services rise significantly, our results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, if internet access fees or other charges to internet users increase, our user traffic may decline and our business may be harmed.\nAny significant disruption in our IT systems, including events beyond our control, could prevent us from offering our solutions and services or reduce their attractiveness and result in a loss of car buyers or leases and financial institutions.\nIn the event of a system outage, malfunction or data loss, our ability to provide services would be materially and adversely affected. The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our technology and our underlying network infrastructure are critical to our operations, user service, reputation and our ability to attract new and retain existing car buyers and financial institutions. Our IT systems infrastructure is currently deployed, and our data is currently maintained through a customized cloud computing system. Our servers are housed at third-party data centers, and our operations depend on the service providers\u2019 ability to protect our systems in their facilities as well as their own systems against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, air quality issues, environmental conditions, computer viruses or attempts to harm our systems, criminal acts and similar events, many of which may be beyond our control. Many of our mobile applications are also provided through third-party app stores and any disruptions to the services of these app stores may negatively affect the delivery of our mobile applications to users. Moreover, if our arrangement with these service providers are terminated or if there is a lapse of service or damage to their facilities or if the services are no longer cost-effective to us, we could experience interruptions in our solutions and service as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new automotive financing solutions for car buyers and to serve our other platform participants. Our ability to exchange information with financial institutions and obtain credit data from third parties could also be interrupted.\nAny interruptions or delays in our service, whether as a result of third-party error, our error, natural disasters or security breaches, whether accidental or willful, could harm our relationships with car buyers and financial institutions and our reputation. We may not have sufficient capacity to recover all data and services lost in the event of an outage. These factors could prevent us from processing credit applications and other business operations, damage our brands and reputation, divert our employees\u2019 attention, reduce our revenue, subject us to liability and cause car buyers and financial institutions to abandon our solutions and services, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMisconduct, errors and failure to function by our employees and third-party service providers could harm our business and reputation.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risks, including the risk of misconduct and errors by our employees and third-party service providers. Our business depends on our employees and third-party service providers to interact with potential customers, process large numbers of transactions and support the loan/lease payment collection process, all of which involve the use and disclosure of personal information. We could be materially adversely affected if transactions were redirected, misappropriated or otherwise improperly executed, if personal information was disclosed to unintended recipients or if an operational breakdown or failure in the processing of transactions occurred, whether as a result of human error, purposeful sabotage or fraudulent manipulation of our operations or systems. In addition, the manner in which we store and use certain personal information and interact with our customers is governed by various PRC laws. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct or errors by employees or third-party service providers, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses. If any of our employees or third-party service providers take, convert or misuse funds, documents or data or fail to follow protocol when interacting with customers, we could be liable for damages and subject to regulatory actions and penalties. We could also be perceived to have facilitated or participated in the illegal misappropriation of funds, documents or data, or the failure to follow protocol, and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability. Aggressive practices or misconduct by any of our third-party service providers in the course of collecting loans could damage our reputation.\nFurthermore, as we rely on certain third-party service providers, such as third-party payment platforms and custody and settlement service providers, to conduct our business, if these third-party service providers failed to function properly, we cannot assure you that we would be able to find an alternative in a timely and cost-efficient manner or at all. Any of these occurrences could result in our diminished ability to operate our business, potential liability to borrowers and investors, inability to attract borrowers and investors, reputational damage, regulatory intervention and financial harm, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA severe or prolonged downturn in the Chinese or global economy could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAny prolonged slowdown in the Chinese or global economy may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In particular, general economic factors and conditions in China or worldwide, including the general interest rate environment and unemployment rates, may affect automobile purchasers\u2019 willingness to seek financing and financing partners\u2019 ability and desire to provide financing. Economic conditions in China are sensitive to global economic conditions. The global financial markets have experienced significant disruptions since 2008 and the United States, Europe and other economies have experienced periods of recession. The recovery from the lows of 2008 and 2009 has been uneven and there are new challenges, including the escalation of the European sovereign debt crisis from 2011 and the slowdown of China's economic growth since 2012 which may continue. There is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world's leading economies, including the United States and China. In particular, general economic factors and conditions in China or worldwide, including the general interest rate environment and unemployment rates, may affect consumers\u2019 demand for cars, car buyers\u2019 willingness to seek credit and financial institutions\u2019 ability and desire to fund financing transactions we facilitate. Economic conditions in China are sensitive to global economic conditions. The outbreak of COVID-19 coronavirus has resulted in declines in economic activities in China and other parts of the world and raised concerns about the prospects of the global economy. As of the date of this Report, we are unable to assess the full impact of the outbreak on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There have also been concerns over unrest in Ukraine, the Middle East and Africa, which have resulted in volatility in financial and other markets. There have also been concerns about the economic effect of the tensions in the relationship between China and the United States. If present Chinese and global economic uncertainties persist, our business partners may suspend their collaboration or reduce their business with us. Adverse economic conditions could also reduce the number of customers seeking to utilize our services. Should any of these situations occur, our transaction volume will decline, and our business and financial conditions will be negatively impacted. Additionally, continued turbulence in the international markets may adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs.\nOur ability to protect the confidential information of our customers may be adversely affected by cyber-attacks, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or similar disruptions.\nWe collect, store and process certain personal and other sensitive data from our customers, which makes it an attractive target and potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or similar disruptions. While we have taken steps to protect the confidential information that we have access to, our security measures could be breached. Because techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to our operation systems could cause confidential user information to be stolen and used for criminal purposes. Security breaches or unauthorized access to confidential information could also expose us to liability related to the loss of the information, time-consuming and expensive litigation and negative publicity. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in our technology infrastructure are exposed and exploited, our relationships with borrowers and investors could be severely damaged, we could incur significant liability and our business and operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to develop and maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud.\nIn connection with the audits of our financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2020, we have identified \u201cmaterial weaknesses\u201d and other control deficiencies including significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. As defined in the standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board of the United States (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d), a \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe material weaknesses that have been identified include: (i)insufficient personnel with appropriate levels of accounting knowledge and experience to address complex U.S. GAAP accounting issues and to prepare and review financial statements and related disclosures under U.S. GAAP; (ii) lack of adequate policies and procedures in internal audit function to ensure that our policies and procedures have been carried out as planned; (iii) lack of appropriate backup and restoration plan; and (iv) failure to establish and perform periodic review and security monitoring of unauthorized access to the financial system.\nWe have implemented, and continue to implement, measures designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the control deficiencies that led to these material weaknesses. We hired Deloitte to help with improvements on our framework of internal controls, including setting up a risk and control matrix, drawing flowcharts of significant transactions, evaluating controls effectiveness and preparing manual of internal control. As of March 31, 2020, we improved the communication to the Board and obtained proper approval for the material transactions and retained an experienced U.S. GAAP consultant to assist us with the financial reporting and complex accounting issues. We also hired an internal audit staff to start our internal audit work. We plan to (i) hire additional accounting staffs with comprehensive knowledge of U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements; (ii) improve our internal audit function, internal control policies and monitoring controls based on the work of our internal audit staff and (iii) improve our system security environment and conducting regular backup plan and penetration testing to ensure the network and information security.\nWe cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we intend to take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or that they will prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. In addition, neither our management nor an independent registered public accounting firm has performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act because no such evaluation has been required. Had we or our independent registered public accounting firm performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, additional material weaknesses may have been identified. If we are unable to successfully remediate our existing or any future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or identify any additional material weaknesses, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, potentially resulting in restatements of our financial statements, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports and applicable Nasdaq listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting, and our share price may decline as a result.\nWe may not be able to prevent others from unauthorized use of our intellectual property, which could harm our business and competitive position.\nWe regard our trademarks, domain names, know-how, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on a combination of intellectual property laws and contractual arrangements, including confidentiality and non-compete agreements with our employees and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have 15 software copyrights, eleven trademarks and three trademark applications pending at the PRC Trademark Office. See \u201cBusiness - Intellectual Property\u201d and \u201cBusiness - Regulations - Regulations on Intellectual Property.\u201d Thus, we cannot assure you that any of our intellectual property rights would not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated, or such intellectual property will be sufficient to provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, because of the rapid pace of technological change in our industries, parts of our business rely on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties on reasonable terms, or at all.\nIt is often difficult to register, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights in China. Statutory laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and enforcement and may not be applied consistently due to the lack of clear guidance on statutory interpretation. Confidentiality and non-compete agreements may be breached by counterparties, and there may not be adequate remedies available to us for any such breach. Accordingly, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights or to enforce our contractual rights in China. Preventing any unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly and the steps we take may be inadequate to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property. In the event that we resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managerial and financial resources. We can provide no assurance that we will prevail in such litigation. In addition, our trade secrets may be leaked or otherwise become available to, or be independently discovered by, our competitors. To the extent that our employees or consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related know-how and inventions. Any failure in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which may be expensive to defend and may disrupt our business and operations.\nWe cannot be certain that our operations or any aspects of our business do not or will not infringe upon or otherwise violate trademarks, patents, copyrights, know-how or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. We may be from time to time in the future subject to legal proceedings and claims relating to the intellectual property rights of others. In addition, there may be third-party trademarks, patents, copyrights, know-how or other intellectual property rights that are infringed by our products, services or other aspects of our business without our awareness. Holders of such intellectual property rights may seek to enforce such intellectual property rights against us in China, the United States or other jurisdictions. If any third-party infringement claims are brought against us, we may be forced to divert management's time and other resources from our business and operations to defend against these claims, regardless of their merits.\nAdditionally, the application and interpretation of China\u2019s intellectual property right laws and the procedures and standards for granting trademarks, patents, copyrights, know-how or other intellectual property rights in China are still evolving and are uncertain, and we cannot assure you that PRC courts or regulatory authorities would agree with our analysis. If we were found to have violated the intellectual property rights of others, we may be subject to liability for our infringement activities or may be prohibited from using such intellectual property, and we may incur licensing fees or be forced to develop alternatives of our own. As a result, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nSome aspects of our digital operations include open source software, and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business.\nSome aspects of our digital operations include software covered by open source licenses. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by PRC courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our online and mobile-based channels. If portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code, re-engineer all or a portion of our technologies if required so by the license, or otherwise be limited in the licensing of our technologies, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technologies and loan products. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Many of the risks associated with use of open source software cannot be eliminated, and could adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time we may evaluate and potentially consummate strategic investments or acquisitions, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results.\nAlthough we do not currently have any plans to consummate any acquisitions, we may in the future evaluate and consider strategic investments, combinations, acquisitions or alliances to further increase the value of our services and better serve our customers. These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations if consummated. If we are able to identify an appropriate business opportunity, we may not be able to successfully consummate the transaction and, even if we do consummate such a transaction, we may be unable to obtain the benefits or avoid the difficulties and risks of such transaction.\nStrategic investments or acquisitions will involve risks commonly encountered in business relationships, including:\n\u00b7 difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations, personnel, systems, data, technologies, products and services of the acquired business;\n\u00b7 inability of the acquired technologies, products or businesses to achieve expected levels of revenue, profitability, productivity or other benefits;\n\u00b7 difficulties in retaining, training, motivating and integrating key personnel;\n\u00b7 diversion of management's time and resources from our normal daily operations;\n\u00b7 difficulties in successfully incorporating licensed or acquired technology and rights into our business;\n\u00b7 difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies within the combined organizations;\n\u00b7 difficulties in retaining relationships with customers, employees and suppliers of the acquired business;\n\u00b7 risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;\n\u00b7 regulatory risks, including remaining in good standing with existing regulatory bodies or receiving any necessary pre-closing or post-closing approvals, as well as being subject to new regulators with oversight over an acquired business;\n\u00b7 assumption of contractual obligations that contain terms that are not beneficial to us, require us to license or waive intellectual property rights or increase our risk for liability;\n\u00b7 failure to successfully further develop the acquired technology;\n\u00b7 liability for activities of the acquired business before the acquisition, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities;\n\u00b7 potential disruptions to our ongoing businesses; and\n\u00b7 unexpected costs and unknown risks and liabilities associated with strategic investments or acquisitions.\nWe may not make any investments or acquisitions, or any future investments or acquisitions may not be successful, may not benefit our business strategy, may not generate sufficient revenues to offset the associated acquisition costs or may not otherwise result in the intended benefits. In addition, we cannot assure you that any future investment in or acquisition of new businesses or technology will lead to the successful development of new or enhanced loan products and services or that any new or enhanced loan products and services, if developed, will achieve market acceptance or prove to be profitable.\nOur business depends on the continued efforts of our senior management. If one or more of our key executives were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, our business may be severely disrupted.\nOur business operations depend on the continued services of our senior management, particularly the executive officers named in this Report. While we have provided different incentives to our management, we cannot assure you that we can continue to retain their services. If one or more of our key executives were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them easily or at all, our future growth may be constrained, our business may be severely disrupted and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we may incur additional expenses to recruit, train and retain qualified personnel. In addition, although we have entered into confidentiality and non-competition agreements with our management, there is no assurance that any member of our management team will not join our competitors or form a competing business. If any dispute arises between our current or former officers and us, we may have to incur substantial costs and expenses in order to enforce such agreements in China or we may be unable to enforce them at all.\nCompetition for employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified and skilled employees needed to support our business.\nWe believe our success depends on the efforts and talent of our employees, including risk management, driver and automobile management, post-financing management, financial and marketing personnel. Our future success depends on our continued ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain qualified and skilled employees. Competition for highly skilled technical, risk management and financial personnel is extremely intense. We may not be able to hire and retain these personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. Some of the companies with which we compete for experienced employees have greater resources than we have and may be able to offer more attractive terms of employment.\nIn addition, we invest significant time and expenses in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. If we fail to retain our employees, we could incur significant expenses in hiring and training their replacements, and the quality of our services and our ability to serve borrowers and investors could diminish, resulting in a material adverse effect to our business.\nIncreases in labor costs in the PRC may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe economy in China has experienced increases in inflation and labor costs in recent years. As a result, average wages in the PRC are expected to continue to increase. In addition, we are required by PRC laws and regulations to pay various statutory employee benefits, including pension, housing fund, medical insurance, work-related injury insurance, unemployment insurance and maternity insurance to designated government agencies for the benefit of our employees. The relevant government agencies may examine whether an employer has made adequate payments to the statutory employee benefits, and those employers who fail to make adequate payments may be subject to late payment fees, fines and/or other penalties. We expect that our labor costs, including wages and employee benefits, will continue to increase. Unless we are able to control our labor costs or pass on these increased labor costs to our customers by increasing the fees of our services, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nCertain data and information in this Report were obtained from third-party sources and were not independently verified by us.\nThis Report contains certain data and information that we obtained from various government and private entity publications. Statistical data in these publications also include projections based on a number of assumptions. If any one or more of the assumptions underlying the market data is later found to be incorrect, actual results may differ from the projections based on these assumptions.\nWe have not independently verified the data and information contained in such third-party publications and reports. Data and information contained in such third-party publications and reports may be collected using third-party methodologies, which may differ from the data collection methods used by us. In addition, these industry publications and reports generally indicate that the information contained therein was believed to be reliable, but do not guarantee the accuracy and completeness of such information.\nIf we cannot maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, collaboration and focus that contribute to our business.\nWe believe that a critical component of our success is our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, encourages teamwork and cultivates creativity. As we develop the infrastructure of a public company and continue to grow, we may find it difficult to maintain these valuable aspects of our corporate culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively impact our future success, including our ability to attract and retain employees, encourage innovation and teamwork and effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives.\nWe have limited business insurance coverage.\nInsurance companies in China currently do not offer as extensive an array of insurance products as insurance companies in more developed economies. Currently, we do not have any business liability or disruption insurance to cover our operations other than the accident insurance and commercial liability insurance, which are mandatory, on all the automobiles we purchase for sales or financing. We have determined that the costs of insuring for these risks and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have such insurance. Any uninsured business disruptions may result in our incurring substantial costs and the diversion of resources, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks related to natural disasters, health epidemics and other outbreaks, which could significantly disrupt our operations.\nWe are vulnerable to natural disasters and other calamities. Fire, floods, typhoons, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins, war, riots, terrorist attacks or similar events may give rise to server interruptions, breakdowns, system failures, technology platform failures or internet failures, which could cause the loss or corruption of data or malfunctions of software or hardware as well as adversely affect our ability to provide products and services.\nOur business could also be adversely affected by the effects of COVID-19, Ebola virus disease, H1N1 flu, H7N9 flu, avian flu, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (\u201cSARS\u201d), or other epidemics. Our business operations could be disrupted if any of our employees is suspected of having COVID-19, Ebola virus disease, H1N1 flu, H7N9 flu, avian flu, SARS or other epidemic, since it could require our employees to be quarantined and/or our offices to be disinfected. In addition, our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that any of these epidemics harms the Chinese economy in general.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure\nOur current corporate structure and business operations may be affected by the newly enacted Foreign Investment Law.\nOn March 15, 2019, the NPC approved the Foreign Investment Law, which has taken effect on January 1, 2020. Since it is relatively new, uncertainties exist in relation to its interpretation and its implementation rules that are yet to be issued. The PRC Foreign Investment Law does not explicitly classify whether variable interest entities that are controlled through contractual arrangements would be deemed as foreign-invested enterprises if they are ultimately \u201ccontrolled\u201d by foreign investors. However, it has a catch-all provision under definition of \u201cforeign investment\u201d that includes investments made by foreign investors in China through other means as provided by laws, administrative regulations or the State Council. Therefore it still leaves leeway for future laws, administrative regulations or provisions of the State Council to provide for contractual arrangements as a form of foreign investment. Therefore, there can be no assurance that our control over Sichuan Senmiao through contractual arrangements will not be deemed as foreign investment in the future.\nThe PRC Foreign Investment Law grants national treatment to foreign-invested entities, except for those foreign-invested entities that operate in industries specified as either \u201crestricted\u201d or \u201cprohibited\u201d from foreign investment in a \u201cnegative list\u201d that is yet to be published. It is unclear whether the \u201cnegative list\u201d to be published will differ from the current Special Administrative Measures for Market Access of Foreign Investment (Negative List). The PRC Foreign Investment Law provides that foreign-invested entities operating in \u201crestricted\u201d or \u201cprohibited\u201d industries will require market entry clearance and other approvals from relevant PRC government authorities. If our control over Sichuan Senmiao through contractual arrangements are deemed as foreign investment in the future, and any business of Sichuan Senmiao is \u201crestricted\u201d or \u201cprohibited\u201d from foreign investment under the \u201cnegative list\u201d effective at the time, we may be deemed to be in violation of the Foreign Investment Law, the contractual arrangements that allow us to have control over Sichuan Senmiao may be deemed as invalid and illegal, and we may be required to unwind such contractual arrangements and/or restructure our business operations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business operation.\nFurthermore, if future laws, administrative regulations or provisions mandate further actions to be taken by companies with respect to existing contractual arrangements, we may face substantial uncertainties as to whether we can complete such actions in a timely manner, or at all. Failure to take timely and appropriate measures to cope with any of these or similar regulatory compliance challenges could materially and adversely affect our current corporate structure and business operations.\nWe rely on the Voting Agreement with other shareholders of Jinkailong to operate our automobile transaction and related services business, and such Voting Agreement is subject to various risks, the realization of which may impact our ability to control Jinkailong and consolidate its financial statements.\nWe hold 35% of the equity interest of Jinkailong and control the remaining 65% equity interest through the Voting Agreement with the other four shareholders of Jinkailong. Although we are the largest shareholder and through the Voting Agreement, control the corporate matters of Jinkailong including fundamental corporate transactions, the other shareholders of Jinkailong may breach the Voting Agreement, or act in concert and exert control over Jinkailong through their majority equity ownership, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to effectively control Jinkailong and receive economic benefits from it.\nUnder the Voting Agreement, the other shareholders may not dispose of their equity interest in Jinkailong unless the new shareholder agrees to be bound by the Voting Agreement. However, as the Voting Agreement is neither registered with any government authority nor publicly disclosed, a good faith third party purchaser may refuse to recognize the Voting Agreement and become a party to such agreement, which will impact our ability to control Jinkailong. Likewise, if the equity interest of Jinkailong held by other shareholders is sold to any third party in satisfaction of the debt of such shareholders, our ability to enforce our rights under the Voting Agreement may be impaired.\nIf any of the events occurs, we may not effectively control the operations of Jinkailong and may lose the ability to consolidate the financial statements of Jinkailong under US GAAP, which will materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions.\nIf the PRC government deems that the contractual arrangements in relation to Sichuan Senmiao do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions on foreign investment in the relevant industries, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations.\nForeign ownership of internet-based businesses, such as distribution of online information, is subject to restrictions under current PRC laws and regulations. For example, foreign investors are not allowed to own more than 50% of the equity interests in a value-added telecommunication service provider (except e-commerce) and any such foreign investor must have experience in providing value-added telecommunications services overseas and maintain a good track record in accordance with the Provisions on the Administration of Foreign-invested Telecommunication Enterprises, the Special Administrative Measures for Entrance of Foreign Investment (Negative List) (2018 Version), the Special Administrative Measures for Entrance of Foreign Investment (Negative List) (2019 Version) and the Special Administrative Measures for Entrance of Foreign Investment (Negative List) (2020 Version) (which will come into force on July 23, 2020 and replace the 2019 Version).\nWe are a Nevada corporation and our PRC subsidiaries are considered foreign invested enterprises. To comply with PRC laws and regulations, we conduct our operations of Online Lending Services in China through a series of contractual arrangements entered into among Senmiao Consulting, Sichuan Senmiao and the Sichuan Senmiao Shareholders. As a result of these contractual arrangements, we exert control over Sichuan Senmiao and consolidate its operating results in our financial statements under U.S. GAAP. For a detailed description of these contractual arrangements, see \u201cBusiness - Our Corporate Structure.\u201d\nIn the opinion of our PRC counsel, Yuan Tai Law Offices, our current ownership structure, the ownership structure of Senmiao Consulting and Sichuan Senmiao, and the contractual arrangements among Senmiao Consulting, Sichuan Senmiao and the Sichuan Senmiao Shareholders are not in violation of existing PRC laws, rules and regulations; and these contractual arrangements are valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws and regulations currently in effect. However, Yuan Tai Law Offices has also advised us that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current or future PRC laws and regulations and there can be no assurance that the PRC government will ultimately take a view that is consistent with the opinion of our PRC counsel.\nIt is uncertain whether any new PRC laws, rules or regulations relating to variable interest entity structures will be adopted or if adopted, what they would provide. If the ownership structure, contractual arrangements and business of our company, Senmiao Consulting or Sichuan Senmiao are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, or we fail to obtain or maintain any of the required permits or approvals, the relevant governmental authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violation, including levying fines, confiscating our income or the income of Senmiao Consulting or Sichuan Senmiao, revoking the business licenses or operating licenses of Senmiao Consulting or Sichuan Senmiao, , discontinuing or placing restrictions or onerous conditions on our operations, requiring us to undergo a costly and disruptive restructuring, restricting or prohibiting our use of proceeds from our public offerings to finance our business and operations in China, and taking other regulatory or enforcement actions that could be harmful to our business. Any of these actions could cause significant disruption to our business operations and severely damage our reputation, which would in turn materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of these occurrences results in our inability to direct the activities of Sichuan Senmiao, and/or our failure to receive economic benefits from Sichuan Senmiao, we may not be able to consolidate its results into our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nWe rely on contractual arrangements with Sichuan Senmiao, Jinkailong and their respective equity holders for our business operations, which may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control.\nWe have relied and expect to continue to rely on contractual arrangements with Sichuan Senmiao, Jinkailong and their respective equity holders to a substantial part of our automobile transaction and related services. For a description of these contractual arrangements, see \u201cBusiness - Our Corporate Structure.\u201d These contractual arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us with control over Sichuan Senmiao or Jinkailong. For example, Sichuan Senmiao, Jinkailong and their respective equity holders could breach their contractual arrangements with us by, among other things, failing to conduct its operations in an acceptable manner or taking other actions that are detrimental to our interests.\nIf we had direct ownership of Sichuan Senmiao or own over 50% equity interest of Jinkailong, we would be able to exercise our rights as an equity holder to effect changes in the board of directors of Sichuan Senmiao or Jinkailong, which in turn could implement changes, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations, at the management and operational level. However, under the current contractual arrangements, we rely on the performance by Sichuan Senmiao, Jinkailong and their respective equity holders of their obligations under the contracts to exercise control over Sichuan Senmiao or Jinkailong. The equity holders of Sichuan Senmiao or Jinkailong may not act in the best interests of our company or may not perform their obligations under these contracts. Such risks exist throughout the period in which we intend to operate our business through the contractual arrangements with Sichuan Senmiao or Jinkailong. If any equity holder of Sichuan Senmiao or Jinkailong is uncooperative or any dispute relating to these contracts remains unresolved, we will have to enforce our rights under these contracts through the operations of PRC laws and arbitration, litigation and other legal proceedings and therefore will be subject to uncertainties in the PRC legal system. Therefore, our contractual arrangements with Sichuan Senmiao or Jinkailong may not be as effective in ensuring our control over the relevant portion of our business operations as direct ownership would be.\nAny failure by our VIEs or their equity holders to perform their obligations under our contractual arrangements with them would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf our VIEs or their equity holders fail to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we may have to incur substantial costs and expend additional resources to enforce such arrangements. We may also have to rely on legal remedies under PRC laws, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, and claiming damages, which we cannot assure you will be effective under PRC laws. For example, if the equity holders of Sichuan Senmiao were to refuse to transfer their equity interest in Sichuan Senmiao to us or our designee if we exercise the purchase option pursuant to these contractual arrangements, or if the equity holders of Jinkailong refused to perform their obligations under these contractual arrangements, or if they were otherwise to act in bad faith toward us, then we may have to take legal actions to compel them to perform their contractual obligations.\nAll the agreements under our contractual arrangements are governed by PRC laws and provide for the resolution of disputes in China. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC laws and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. The legal system in the PRC is not as developed as in some other jurisdictions, such as the United States. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. Meanwhile, there are very few precedents and little formal guidance as to how contractual arrangements in the context of a consolidated variable interest entity should be interpreted or enforced under PRC laws. In the event that we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, or if we suffer significant delay or other obstacles in the process of enforcing these contractual arrangements, we may not be able to exert effective control over Sichuan Senmiao, and our ability to conduct our business may be negatively affected. See \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to Doing Business in China - Uncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to us.\u201d\nThe equity holders of our VIEs may have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe interests of the equity holders in our VIEs may differ from the interests of our company as a whole. These equity holders may breach, or cause our VIEs to breach, the existing contractual arrangements we have with them and our VIEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to effectively control our VIEs and receive economic benefits from them. For example, the equity holders may be able to cause our agreements with our VIEs to be performed in a manner adverse to us. We cannot assure you that when conflicts of interest arise, any or all of these equity holders will act in the best interests of our company or such conflicts will be resolved in our favor.\nCurrently, we do not have any arrangements to address potential conflicts of interest between these equity holders and our company, except that we could exercise our purchase option under the exclusive option agreement with the Sichuan Senmiao Shareholders to request them to transfer all of their equity interests in Sichuan Senmiao to a PRC entity or individual designated by us, to the extent permitted by PRC laws or in the case of Jinkailong, the other shareholders of Jinkailong (except one minor shareholder) have committed not to, directly or indirectly, engage in the same business in which the Company engages. If we cannot resolve any conflict of interest or dispute between us and the Sichuan Senmiao Shareholders, we would have to rely on legal proceedings, which could result in the disruption of our business and subject us to substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings.\nContractual arrangements in relation to Sichuan Senmiao may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities and they may determine that we or Sichuan Senmiao owe additional taxes, which could negatively affect our financial condition and the value of your investment.\nUnder applicable PRC laws and regulations, arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject to audit or challenge by the PRC tax authorities within ten years after the taxable year when the transactions are conducted. The EIT Law requires every enterprise in China to submit its annual enterprise income tax return together with a report on transactions with its related parties to the relevant tax authorities. The tax authorities may impose reasonable adjustments on taxation if they have identified any related party transactions that are inconsistent with arm's length principles. We may face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that the contractual arrangements among Senmiao Consulting, Sichuan Senmiao, and Sichuan Senmiao Shareholders were not entered into on an arm's length basis in such a way as to result in an impermissible reduction in taxes under applicable PRC laws, rules and regulations, and adjust Sichuan Senmiao\u2019s income in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. A transfer pricing adjustment could, among other things, result in a reduction of expense deductions recorded by Sichuan Senmiao for PRC tax purposes, which could in turn increase its tax liabilities without reducing Senmiao Consulting's tax expenses. In addition, if Senmiao Consulting requests the Sichuan Senmiao Shareholders to transfer their equity interests in Sichuan Senmiao at nominal or no value pursuant to these contractual arrangements, such transfer could be viewed as a gift and subject Senmiao Consulting to PRC income tax. Furthermore, the PRC tax authorities may impose late payment fees and other penalties on Sichuan Senmiao for the adjusted but unpaid taxes according to the applicable regulations. Our financial position could be materially and adversely affected if Sichuan Senmiao's tax liabilities increase or if it is required to pay late payment fees and other penalties.\nWe may lose the ability to use and enjoy assets held by our VIEs that are material to the operation of our business if the entity goes bankrupt or becomes subject to a dissolution or liquidation proceeding.\nOur VIEs hold certain assets that are material to the operation of our business. Under the contractual arrangements, our VIEs may not and its equity holders may not cause it to, in any manner, sell, transfer, mortgage or dispose of its assets or its legal or beneficial interests in the business without our prior consent. However, in the event the equity holders of our VIEs breach the these contractual arrangements and voluntarily liquidate our VIEs, or any of our VIEs declares bankruptcy and all or part of its assets become subject to liens or rights of third-party creditors, or are otherwise disposed of without our consent, we may be unable to continue some or all of our business activities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any of our VIEs undergoes a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding, independent third-party creditors may claim rights to some or all of these assets, thereby hindering our ability to operate our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nWe are required to obtain a value-added telecommunication business certificate and be subject to foreign investment restrictions.\nPRC regulations impose sanctions for engaging in Internet information services of a commercial nature without having obtained an ICP certificate. PRC regulations also impose sanctions for engaging in the operation of online data processing and transaction processing without having obtained an online data processing and transaction processing, or ODPTP, certificate (ICP and ODPTP are both sub-sets of value-added telecommunication business certificates). These sanctions include corrective orders and warnings from the PRC communication administration authority, fines and confiscation of illegal gains and, in the case of significant infringements, the websites may be ordered to cease operation. To the extent that the PRC regulatory authorities require such value-added telecommunication certificate to be obtained or set forth rules that impose additional requirements, and we do not obtain such certificate, we may be subject to the sanctions described above.\nAccording to the Provisions on the Administration of Foreign-Invested Telecommunication Enterprises, the ratio of investment by foreign investors in a foreign-invested telecommunication enterprise that engages in the operation of a value-added telecommunication business shall not exceed 50%. Foreign investors are only permitted to invest up to 50% of the registered capital in a foreign-invested telecommunication enterprise that engages in the operation of commercial Internet information services or general online data processing and transaction processing services.\nAs an exception, Circular 196, which was promulgated on June 19, 2015, provides that foreign investors are permitted to invest up to 100% of the registered capital in a foreign-invested telecommunication enterprise engaging in the operation of online data processing and transaction processing (E-commerce). While Circular 196 permits foreign ownership, in whole or in part, of online data processing and transaction processing businesses (E-commerce), a sub-set of value-added telecommunications services, there is still uncertainty regarding whether foreign investment restrictions may be applied to our business and industry.\nFurther, under either circumstance, the largest foreign investor will be required to have a satisfactory business track record and operational experience in the value-added telecommunication business. Any restructuring to meet the requirements may be costly and may involve interruptions to our business. If we are unable to obtain the telecommunication business certificate in a timely fashion, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in China's economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nSubstantially all of our operations are located in China. Accordingly, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced to a significant degree by political, economic and social conditions in China generally and by continued economic growth in China as a whole.\nThe Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the amount of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the government. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over China's economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\nWhile the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. In addition, in the past the Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate increases, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, and since 2012, China\u2019s economic growth has slowed down. Any prolonged slowdown in the Chinese economy may reduce the demand for our products and services and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nUncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to us.\nThe PRC legal system is based on written statutes and prior court decisions have limited value as precedents. Since these laws and regulations are relatively new and the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always uniform and enforcement of these laws, regulations and rules involves uncertainties.\nFrom time to time, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce our legal rights. However, since PRC administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy than in more developed legal systems. Furthermore, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published in a timely manner or at all) that may have retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. Such uncertainties, including uncertainty over the scope and effect of our contractual, property (including intellectual property) and procedural rights, could materially and adversely affect our business and impede our ability to continue our operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by the complexity, uncertainties and changes in PRC regulation of internet-related businesses and companies, and any lack of requisite approvals, licenses or permits applicable to our business may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe PRC government extensively regulates the internet industry, including foreign ownership of, and the licensing and permit requirements pertaining to, companies in the internet industry. These internet-related laws and regulations are relatively new and evolving, and their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainties. As a result, in certain circumstances it may be difficult to determine what actions or omissions may be deemed to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations.\nThe evolving PRC regulatory system for the internet industry may lead to the establishment of new regulatory agencies. For example, in May 2011, the State Council announced the establishment of a new department, the State Internet Information Office (with the involvement of the State Council Information Office, the MIIT, and the MPS). The primary role of this new agency is to facilitate the policy-making and legislative development in this field, to direct and coordinate with the relevant departments in connection with online content administration and to deal with cross-ministry regulatory matters in relation to the internet industry.\nThe Circular on Strengthening the Administration of Foreign Investment in and Operation of Value-added Telecommunications Business, issued by the MIIT in July 2006, prohibits domestic telecommunication service providers from leasing, transferring or selling telecommunications business operating licenses to any foreign investor in any form, or providing any resources, sites or facilities to any foreign investor for their illegal operation of a telecommunications business in China. According to this circular, either the holder of a value-added telecommunication services operation permit or its shareholders must directly own the domain names and trademarks used by such license holders in their provision of value-added telecommunication services. The circular also requires each license holder to have the necessary facilities, including servers, for its approved business operations and to maintain such facilities in the regions covered by its license.\nSichuan Senmiao owns the relevant domain names and as of the date of this Report, the website used for our previous P2P online lending services business (which website continues to contains historical information) has not been fully shut down and remains accessible to the public. It is not clear whether our existing online lending website would be deemed as operating value-added telecommunications business. However, if we were deemed to operate telecommunications business without operating licenses, the relevant governmental authority will order us to rectify the noncompliance, confiscate illegal gains and impose a fine equal to three to five times of the illegal gains. If no illegal gains or the illegal gain is less than RMB 50,000, a fine of between RMB 100,000 and RMB 1,000,000 will be imposed. In case of material violation, our business may be suspended and rectification will be carried out.\nThe interpretation and application of existing PRC laws, regulations and policies and possible new laws, regulations or policies relating to the internet industry have created substantial uncertainties regarding the legality of existing and future foreign investments in, and the businesses and activities of, internet businesses in China, including our business. We cannot assure you that we have obtained all the permits or licenses required for conducting our business in China or will be able to maintain our existing licenses or obtain new ones. If the PRC government considers that we were operating without the proper approvals, licenses or permits or promulgates new laws and regulations that require additional approvals or licenses or imposes additional restrictions on the operation of any part of our business, it has the power, among other things, to levy fines, confiscate our income, revoke our business licenses, and require us to discontinue our relevant business or impose restrictions on the affected portion of our business. Any of these actions by the PRC government may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, and any limitation on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to make payments to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business.\nWe are a holding company, and we rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC subsidiaries for our cash and financing requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our stockholders and service any debt we may incur. If our PRC subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. In addition, the PRC tax authorities may require Senmiao Consulting to adjust its taxable income under the contractual arrangements it currently has in place with Sichuan Senmiao in a manner that would materially and adversely affect its ability to pay dividends and other distributions to us. See \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure - Contractual arrangements in relation to Sichuan Senmiao may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities and they may determine that we or Sichuan Senmiao owe additional taxes, which could negatively affect our financial condition and the value of your investment.\u201d\nUnder PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries, as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise in China, may pay dividends only out of their respective accumulated after-tax profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise is required to set aside at least 10% of its accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve funds, until the aggregate amount of such funds reaches 50% of its registered capital. At its discretion, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise may allocate a portion of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to staff welfare and bonus funds. These reserve funds and staff welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends.\nOur PRC subsidiaries are currently unable to pay us any dividend given their financial condition. If our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 financial condition improves, the above discussed PRC laws will likely limit their ability to pay dividends or make other distributions to us. Such limitations could materially and adversely impact our cash flows and limit our ability to grow, make investments or acquisitions that could be beneficial to our business, pay dividends, or otherwise fund and conduct our business. See also \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to Doing Business in China - If we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC income tax purposes, such classification could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC stockholders.\u201d\nPRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may delay or prevent us from using the proceeds of from our public offerings to make loans to or make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nUnder PRC laws and regulations, we are permitted to utilize the proceeds from our public offerings to fund our PRC subsidiaries by making loans to or additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, subject to applicable government registration and approval requirements.\nAny loans to our PRC subsidiaries, which are treated as foreign-invested enterprises under PRC laws, are subject to PRC regulations and foreign exchange loan registrations. For example, loans by us to our PRC subsidiaries to finance their activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with the local counterpart of SAFE. The statutory limit for the total amount of foreign debts of a foreign-invested company is the difference between the amount of total investment as approved by the MOFCOM or its local counterpart and the amount of registered capital of such foreign-invested company.\nWe have financed and expect to continue to finance our PRC subsidiaries by means of capital contributions. These capital contributions must be approved by the MOFCOM or its local counterpart. In addition, SAFE issued a circular in September 2008, SAFE Circular 142, regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested enterprise of foreign currency registered capital into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. SAFE Circular 142 provides that the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and unless otherwise provided by law, may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. On July 4, 2014, the SAFE issued the Circular of the SAFE on Relevant Issues Concerning the Pilot Reform in Certain Areas of the Administrative Method of the Conversion of Foreign Exchange Funds by Foreign-invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 36, which launched a pilot reform of the administration of the settlement of the foreign exchange capitals of foreign-invested enterprises in certain designated areas from August 4, 2014 and some of the restrictions under SAFE Circular 142 will not apply to the settlement of the foreign exchange capitals of the foreign-invested enterprises established within the designate areas and such enterprises are allowed to use its RMB capital converted from foreign exchange capitals to make equity investment. On March 30, 2015, SAFE promulgated Circular 19, to expand the reform nationwide. Circular 19 came into force and replaced both Circular 142 and Circular 36 on June 1, 2015. Circular 19 allows foreign-invested enterprises to make equity investments by using RMB fund converted from foreign exchange capital. However, Circular 19 continues to prohibit foreign-invested enterprises from, among other things, using RMB fund converted from its foreign exchange capitals for expenditure beyond its business scope, providing entrusted loans or repaying loans between non-financial enterprises. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested company. The use of such RMB capital may not be altered without SAFE's approval, and such RMB capital may not in any case be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used. On June 9, 2016, SAFE issued the Circular on Reforming and Regulating Policies on the Control over Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital Accounts (\u201cCircular 16\u201d), which became effective simultaneously. Pursuant to Circular 16, enterprises registered in the PRC may also convert their foreign debts from foreign currency to RMB on self-discretionary basis. Circular 16 provides an integrated standard for conversion of foreign exchange under capital account items (including but not limited to foreign currency capital and foreign debts) on self-discretionary basis which applies to all enterprises registered in the PRC. Circular 16 reiterates the principle that RMB converted from foreign currency-denominated capital of a company may not be directly or indirectly used for purpose beyond its business scope or prohibited by PRC Laws or regulations, while such converted RMB shall not be provide as loans to its non-affiliated entities. As Circular 16 is newly issued and SAFE has not provided detailed guidelines with respect to its interpretation or implementation, it is uncertain how these rules will be interpreted and implemented. Violations of these Circulars could result in severe monetary or other penalties. These circulars may significantly limit our ability to use RMB converted from the net proceeds of our public offerings to fund the establishment of new entities in China by our PRC subsidiaries, to invest in or acquire any other PRC companies through our PRC subsidiaries, or to establish new variable interest entities in the PRC.\nIn light of the various requirements imposed by PRC regulations on loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies, we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the necessary government registrations or obtain the necessary government approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future capital contributions or future loans by us to our PRC subsidiaries. If we fail to complete such registrations or obtain such approvals, our ability to use the proceeds we expect to receive from our public offerings and to capitalize or otherwise fund our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nFluctuations in exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment.\nSubstantially all of our revenues and expenditures are denominated in RMB, whereas our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and RMB will affect the relative purchasing power in RMB terms of our U.S. dollar assets and the proceeds from our public offerings. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar while the functional currency for our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities is RMB. Gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities that are receivable or payable in RMB are included in our consolidated statements of operations. The remeasurement has caused the U.S. dollar value of our results of operations to vary with exchange rate fluctuations, and the U.S. dollar value of our results of operations will continue to vary with exchange rate fluctuations. A fluctuation in the value of RMB relative to the U.S. dollar could reduce our profits from operations and the translated value of our net assets when reported in U.S. dollars in our financial statements. This could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations as reported in U.S. dollars. If we decide to convert our RMB into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our ordinary shares or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the RMB would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the periods in which the earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.\nThe value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in China's political and economic conditions and China's foreign exchange policies. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed its decade-old policy of pegging the value of the RMB to the U.S. dollar, and the RMB appreciated more than 20% against the U.S. dollar over the following three years. However, the People's Bank of China, or the PBOC, regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to limit fluctuations in RMB exchange rates and achieve policy goals. During the period between July 2008 and June 2010, the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar had been stable and traded within a narrow range. However, the RMB fluctuated significantly during that period against other freely traded currencies, in tandem with the U.S. dollar. Since June 2010, the RMB has started to slowly appreciate against the U.S. dollar, though there have been periods when the U.S. dollar has appreciated against the RMB. On August 11, 2015, the PBOC allowed the RMB to depreciate by approximately 2% against the U.S. dollar. It is difficult to predict how long such depreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollar may last and when and how the relationship between the RMB and the U.S. dollar may change again.\nThere remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a flexible currency policy. Any significant appreciation or depreciation of the RMB may materially and adversely affect our revenues, earnings and financial position, and the value of, and any dividends payable on, our securities in U.S. dollars. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from our public offerings into RMB to pay our operating expenses, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB amount we would receive from the conversion. Conversely, a significant depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar may significantly reduce the U.S. dollar equivalent of our earnings, which in turn could adversely affect the price of our securities.\nVery limited hedging options are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to adequately hedge our exposure or at all. In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currency. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on your investment.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion may limit our ability to utilize our net revenues effectively and affect the value of your investment.\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. We receive substantially all of our net revenues in RMB. Under our current corporate structure, we rely on dividend payments from our PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. Therefore, our PRC subsidiaries are able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to us without prior approval from SAFE, subject to the condition that the remittance of such dividends outside of the PRC complies with certain procedures under PRC foreign exchange regulation, such as the overseas investment registrations by the beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents. But approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our stockholders.\nFailure to make adequate contributions to various employee benefit plans as required by PRC regulations may subject us to penalties.\nWe are required under PRC laws and regulations to participate in various government sponsored employee benefit plans, including certain social insurance, housing funds and other welfare-oriented payment obligations, and contribute to the plans in amounts equal to certain percentages of salaries, including bonuses and allowances, of our employees up to a maximum amount specified by the local government from time to time at locations where we operate our businesses. The requirement of employee benefit plans has not been implemented consistently by the local governments in China given the different levels of economic development in different locations. We have not made adequate employee benefit payments. We may be required to make up the contributions for these plans as well as to pay late fees and fines. If we are subject to late fees or fines in relation to the underpaid employee benefits, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe M&A Rules and certain other PRC regulations establish complex procedures for some acquisitions of PRC companies by foreign investors, which could make it more difficult for us to pursue growth through acquisitions in China.\nThe M&A Rules discussed in the preceding risk factor and some other regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the MOFCOM be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise. Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly Law requires that the MOFCOM shall be notified in advance of any concentration of undertaking if certain thresholds are triggered. In addition, the security review rules issued by the MOFCOM that became effective in September 2011 specify that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors that raise \u201cnational defense and security\u201d concerns and mergers and acquisitions through which foreign investors may acquire de facto control over domestic enterprises that raise \u201cnational security\u201d concerns are subject to strict review by the MOC, and the rules prohibit any activities attempting to bypass a security review, including by structuring the transaction through a proxy or contractual control arrangement. In the future, we may grow our business by acquiring complementary businesses. Complying with the requirements of the above-mentioned regulations and other relevant rules to complete such transactions could be time consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the MOFCOM or its local counterparts may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share.\nPRC regulations relating to offshore investment activities by PRC residents may limit our PRC subsidiaries' ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits to us or otherwise expose us or our PRC resident beneficial owners to liability and penalties under PRC law.\nSAFE promulgated the SAFE Circular 37 in July 2014 that requires PRC residents or entities to register with SAFE or its local branch in connection with their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing. In addition, such PRC residents or entities must update their SAFE registrations when the offshore special purpose vehicle undergoes material events relating to any change of basic information (including change of such PRC citizens or residents, name and operation term), increases or decreases in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, or mergers or divisions. SAFE Circular 37 is issued to replace the Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents Engaging in Financing and Roundtrip Investments via Overseas Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 75. SAFE promulgated the Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving the Administration of the Foreign Exchange Concerning Direct Investment in February 2015, which took effect on June 1, 2015. This notice has amended SAFE Circular 37 requiring PRC residents or entities to register with qualified banks rather than SAFE or its local branch in connection with their establishment or control of an offshore entity established for the purpose of overseas investment or financing.\nIf our stockholders who are PRC residents or entities do not complete their registration as required, our PRC subsidiaries may be prohibited from distributing their profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to us, and we may be restricted in our ability to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with the SAFE registration described above could result in liability under PRC laws for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions.\nTo our knowledge, all of our pre-IPO PRC stockholders who are subject to the registration requirements of Circular 37 have completed the required foreign exchange registrations.\nIn addition, we may not be informed of the identities of all the PRC residents or entities holding direct or indirect interest in our company, nor can we compel our beneficial owners to comply with SAFE registration requirements. As a result, we cannot assure you that all of our stockholders or beneficial owners who are PRC residents or entities have complied with, and will in the future make or obtain any applicable registrations or approvals required by, SAFE regulations. Failure by such stockholders or beneficial owners to comply with SAFE regulations, or failure by us to amend the foreign exchange registrations of our PRC subsidiaries, could subject us to fines or legal sanctions, restrict our overseas or cross-border investment activities, limit our PRC subsidiaries' ability to make distributions or pay dividends to us or affect our ownership structure, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nIf the chops of our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities are not kept safely, are stolen or are used by unauthorized persons or for unauthorized purposes, the corporate governance of these entities could be severely and adversely compromised.\nIn China, a company chop or seal serves as the legal representation of the company towards third parties even when unaccompanied by a signature. Each legally registered company in China is required to maintain a company chop, which must be registered with the local Public Security Bureau. In addition to this mandatory company chop, companies may have several other chops which can be used for specific purposes. The chops of our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities are generally held securely by personnel designated or approved by us in accordance with our internal control procedures. To the extent those chops are not kept safely, are stolen or are used by unauthorized persons or for unauthorized purposes, the corporate governance of these entities could be severely and adversely compromised and those corporate entities may be bound to abide by the terms of any documents so chopped, even if they were chopped by an individual who lacked the requisite power and authority to do so. In addition, if the chops are misused by unauthorized persons, we could experience disruption to our normal business operations. We may have to take corporate or legal action, which could involve significant time and resources to resolve while distracting management from our operations.\nAny failure to comply with PRC regulations regarding the registration requirements for employee stock incentive plans may subject the PRC plan participants or us to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions.\nIn February 2012, SAFE promulgated the Notices on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly-Listed Companies, replacing earlier rules promulgated in March 2007. Pursuant to these rules, PRC citizens and non-PRC citizens who reside in China for a continuous period of not less than one year who participate in any stock incentive plan of an overseas publicly listed company, subject to a few exceptions, are required to register with SAFE through a domestic qualified agent, which could be the PRC subsidiaries of such overseas listed company, and complete certain other procedures. In addition, an overseas entrusted institution must be retained to handle matters in connection with the exercise or sale of stock options and the purchase or sale of shares and interests. We and our executive officers and other employees who are PRC citizens or who have resided in the PRC for a continuous period of not less than one year and who are granted options or other awards under our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan will be subject to these regulations. Failure to complete the SAFE registrations may subject them to fines and legal sanctions and may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital into our PRC subsidiaries and limit our PRC subsidiaries' ability to distribute dividends to us. We also face regulatory uncertainties that could restrict our ability to adopt additional incentive plans for our directors, executive officers and employees under PRC law. See \u201cBusiness - Regulations - SAFE Regulations Relating to Employee Stock Incentive Plans.\u201d\nIf we are classified as a PRC resident enterprise for PRC income tax purposes, such classification could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC stockholders.\nUnder the EIT Law and its implementation rules, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with a \u201cde facto management body\u201d within the PRC is considered a resident enterprise and will be subject to the enterprise income tax on its global income at the rate of 25%. The implementation rules define the term \u201cde facto management body\u201d as the body that exercises full and substantial control over and overall management of the business, productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. In April 2009, the State Administration of Taxation issued a circular, known as Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the \u201cde facto management body\u201d of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. Although this circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners like us, the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the State Administration of Taxation's general position on how the \u201cde facto management body\u201d test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises. According to Circular 82, an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its \u201cde facto management body\u201d in China and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on its global income only if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC; (ii) decisions relating to the enterprise's financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; (iii) the enterprise's primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions, are located or maintained in the PRC; and (iv) at least 50% of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC.\nWe believe none of our entities outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. See \u201cBusiness - Regulations - Regulations Related to Tax.\u201d However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term \u201cde facto management body.\u201d As substantially all of our management members are based in China, it remains unclear how the tax residency rule will apply to our case. If the PRC tax authorities determine that the Company or any of our subsidiaries outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, then the Company or such subsidiary could be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 25% on its world-wide income, which could materially reduce our net income. In addition, we will also be subject to PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. Furthermore, if the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, gains realized on the sale or other disposition of our securities may be subject to PRC tax, at a rate of 10% in the case of non-PRC enterprises or 20% in the case of non-PRC individuals (in each case, subject to the provisions of any applicable tax treaty), if such gains are deemed to be from PRC sources. It is unclear whether non-PRC stockholders of our company would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise. Any such tax may reduce the returns on your investment in our securities.\nEnhanced scrutiny over acquisition transactions by the PRC tax authorities may have a negative impact on potential acquisitions we may pursue in the future.\nThe PRC tax authorities have enhanced their scrutiny over the direct or indirect transfer of certain taxable assets, including, in particular, equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise, by a non-resident enterprise by promulgating and implementing SAT Circular 59 and Circular 698, which became effective in January 2008, and a Circular 7 in replacement of some of the existing rules in Circular 698, which became effective in February 2015.\nUnder Circular 698, where a non-resident enterprise conducts an \u201cindirect transfer\u201d by transferring the equity interests of a PRC \u201cresident enterprise\u201d indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise, being the transferor, may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, if the indirect transfer is considered to be an abusive use of company structure without reasonable commercial purposes. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of up to 10%. Circular 698 also provides that, where a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise to its related parties at a price lower than the fair market value, the relevant tax authority has the power to make a reasonable adjustment to the taxable income of the transaction.\nIn February 2015, the SAT issued Circular 7 to replace the rules relating to indirect transfers in Circular 698. Circular 7 has introduced a new tax regime that is significantly different from that under Circular 698. Circular 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to not only indirect transfers set forth under Circular 698 but also transactions involving transfer of other taxable assets, through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. In addition, Circular 7 provides clearer criteria than Circular 698 on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and has introduced safe harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities market. Circular 7 also brings challenges to both the foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of the taxable assets. Where a non-resident enterprise conducts an \u201cindirect transfer\u201d by transferring the taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise being the transferor, or the transferee, or the PRC entity which directly owned the taxable assets may report to the relevant tax authority such indirect transfer. Using a \u201csubstance over form\u201d principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise.\nOn October 17, 2017, the SAT issued the Public Notice on Issues Relating to Withholding at Source of Income Tax of Non-resident Enterprises, or the SAT Notice 37, which came into effect on December 1, 2017. According to SAT Notice 37, where the non-resident enterprise fails to declare its tax payable pursuant to Article 39 of the EIT Law, the tax authority may order it to pay its tax due within required time limits, and the non-resident enterprise shall declare and pay its tax payable within such time limits specified by the tax authority. If the non-resident enterprise voluntarily declares and pays its tax payable before the tax authority orders it to do so, it shall be deemed that such enterprise has paid its tax payable in time.\nWe face uncertainties on the reporting and consequences on future private equity financing transactions, share exchange or other transactions involving the transfer of shares in our company by investors that are non-PRC resident enterprises. The PRC tax authorities may pursue such non-resident enterprises with respect to a filing or the transferees with respect to withholding obligation, and request our PRC subsidiaries to assist in the filing. As a result, we and non-resident enterprises in such transactions may become at risk of being subject to filing obligations or being taxed, under Circular 59, Circular 7 or SAT Notice 37, and may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with Circular 59, Circular 7 and SAT Notice 37 or to establish that we and our non-resident enterprises should not be taxed under these circulars, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe PRC tax authorities have the discretion under SAT Circular 59, Circular 7 and SAT Notice 37 to make adjustments to the taxable capital gains based on the difference between the fair value of the taxable assets transferred and the cost of investment. Although we currently have no plans to pursue any acquisitions in China or elsewhere in the world, we may pursue acquisitions in the future that may involve complex corporate structures. If we are considered a non-resident enterprise under the EIT Law and if the PRC tax authorities make adjustments to the taxable income of the transactions under SAT Circular 59, Circular 7 and SAT Notice 37, our income tax costs associated with such potential acquisitions will be increased, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in a delisting of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market, and the continued listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market is subject to our compliance with a number of listing standards. On September 30, 2019 and March 31, 2020, we received notices from Nasdaq that because the closing bid price for our common stock had fallen below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, we no longer complied with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Rule 5550(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rules, as tolled for the current COVID-19 pandemic, we have until December 11, 2020 to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days prior to December 11, 2020.\nIf we do not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by December 11, 2020 and the Nasdaq staff determines that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if we are otherwise not eligible for such additional compliance period, Nasdaq will provide notice that our common stock will be subject to delisting. We would have the right to appeal a determination to delist our common stock, and the common stock would remain listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market until the completion of the appeal process. If our common stock were no longer listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, investors might only be able to trade on one of the over-the-counter markets. This would impair the liquidity of our common stock not only in the number of shares that could be bought and sold at a given price, which might be depressed by the relative illiquidity, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and reduction in media coverage. In addition, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u00b7 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u00b7 a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for us; and\n\u00b7 a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe may take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements.\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile.\nThe trading prices of our common stock are likely volatile and could fluctuate widely due to factors beyond our control. This may happen because of broad market and industry factors, like the performance and fluctuation in the market prices or the underperformance or deteriorating financial results of internet or other companies based in China that have listed their securities in the United States in recent years. The securities of some of these companies have experienced significant volatility since their initial public offerings, including, in some cases, substantial decline in their trading prices. The trading performances of other Chinese companies' securities after their offerings may affect the attitudes of investors toward Chinese companies listed in the United States, which consequently may impact the trading performance of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, any negative news or perceptions about inadequate corporate governance practices or fraudulent accounting, corporate structure or other matters of other Chinese companies may also negatively affect the attitudes of investors towards Chinese companies in general, including us, regardless of whether we have conducted any inappropriate activities. In addition, securities markets may from time to time experience significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to our operating performance, which may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition to the above factors, the price and trading volume of our common stock may be highly volatile due to multiple factors, including the following:\n\u00b7 regulatory developments affecting us, our customers, or our industry;\n\u00b7 regulatory uncertainties with regard to our variable interest entity arrangements;\n\u00b7 announcements of studies and reports relating to our loan products and service offerings or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other online finance marketplaces;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and changes or revisions of our expected results;\n\u00b7 changes in financial estimates by securities research analysts;\n\u00b7 conditions in the automobile finance and ride-hailing industries in China;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of new product and service offerings, acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7 additions to or departures of our senior management;\n\u00b7 detrimental negative publicity about us, our management or our industry;\n\u00b7 fluctuations of exchange rates between the RMB and the U.S. dollar;\n\u00b7 release or expiry of lock-up or other transfer restrictions on our outstanding shares of common stock; and\n\u00b7 sales or perceived potential sales of additional shares of common stock.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares are restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is performing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time, subject to certain restrictions described below. These sales, or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. As of July 6, 2020, we had outstanding 28,839,803 shares of common stock, 7,590,804 of which may be resold in the public market immediately without restriction, other than shares owned by our affiliates, which may be sold pursuant to Rule 144. We may register all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans on a Registration Statement on Form S-8. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates.\nWe have a significant number of outstanding warrants, some of which contain full-ratchet anti-dilution protection and reset provisions, which may cause significant dilution to our stockholders, have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future equity offerings.\nAs more fully described in the section herein titled \u201cBusiness - Recent Developments-June 2019 Registered Offering,\u201d pursuant to the June 2019 Offering and the Purchase Agreement, we issued to the Investors Series A Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,336,021 shares of common stock and Series B Warrants to purchase a maximum aggregate of 1,116,320 shares of common stock.\nAmong other provisions, the Series A Warrants provide the Investors with full ratchet anti-dilution protection in the event that we issue any equity or equity-linked securities at a price lower than the exercise price of the Series A Warrants (subject to certain exceptions) and on the six month anniversary of the initial exercise date of the Series A Warrants, the exercise price of Series A Warrants was adjusted from $3.72 to $1.50 per share.\nThe Series B Warrants initially won\u2019t be exercisable for any shares of common stock. In the event that on the 50th day after the closing date of the June 2019 Offering, the closing price of the common stock is less than the Share Purchase Price, then the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Series B Warrants shall be adjusted (upward or downward, as applicable) to the greater of (i) zero (0) and (ii) such aggregate number of shares of common stock equal to 50% of the difference of (A) the quotient of (x) the Share Purchase Price divided by (y) the Market Price (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) as of the 50th day after the closing date of the June 2019 Offering, less (B) the aggregate number of Shares issued to the Investors at the closing (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, share combinations, recapitalizations and similar events).\nThe issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of the Series A Warrants and Series B Warrants would dilute the percentage ownership interest of all stockholders, might dilute the book value per share of our common stock and would increase the number of our publicly traded shares, which could depress the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, the so-called full-ratchet anti-dilution protections and reset provisions, subject to limited exceptions, would reduce the exercise price of the warrants in the event that we in the future issue common stock, or securities convertible into or exercisable to purchase common stock, at a lower price per share.\nIn addition to the dilutive effects described above, the perceived risk of dilution as a result of the significant number of outstanding warrants may cause our common stockholders to be more inclined to sell their shares, which would contribute to a downward movement in the price of our common stock. Moreover, the perceived risk of dilution and the resulting downward pressure on our common stock price could encourage investors to engage in short sales of our common stock, which could further contribute to price declines in our common stock. The fact that our stockholders, warrant holders and option holders can sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, as well as the existence of full-ratchet anti-dilution provisions and reset provisions in a substantial number of our outstanding warrants could make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate, or at all.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could involve restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or grant licenses on terms unfavorable to us.\nCertain judgments obtained against us by our stockholders may not be enforceable.\nWe conduct substantially all of our operations in China and substantially all of our assets are located in China. In addition, most of our directors and executive officers reside within China, and most of the assets of these persons are located within China. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for you to effect service of process within the United States upon these individuals, or to bring an action against us or against these individuals in the United States in the event that you believe your rights have been infringed under the U.S. federal securities laws or otherwise. Even if you are successful in bringing an action of this kind, the laws of the PRC may render you unable to enforce a judgment against our assets or the assets of our directors and officers.\nOur articles of incorporation and by-laws could deter a change of our management, which could discourage or delay offers to acquire us.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation (the \u201cArticles of Incorporation\u201d) and by-laws could discourage or make it more difficult to accomplish a proxy contest or other change in our management or the acquisition of control by a holder of a substantial amount of our voting stock. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish, or could deter transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interests or in our best interests. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 requiring stockholders who wish to request a special meeting of the stockholders to disclose certain specified information in such request and to deliver such request in a specific way within a certain timeframe, which may inhibit or deter stockholders from requesting special meetings of the stockholders;\n\u00b7 requiring that stockholders who wish to act by written consent request a record date from us for such action and such request must include disclosure of certain specified information, which may inhibit or deter stockholders from acting by written consent;\n\u00b7 establishing the board as the sole entity to fill vacancies of the board, which lengthens the time needed to elect a new majority of the board;\n\u00b7 establishing a two-thirds majority vote of the stockholders to remove a director from the board, as opposed to a simple majority, which lengthens the time needed to elect a new majority of the board; and\n\u00b7 establishing that any person who acquires equity in us shall be deemed to have notice and consented to the forum selection provision of our Bylaws requiring actions to be brought only in Nevada, which may inhibit or deter stockholders actions (i) on behalf of us; (ii) asserting claims of breach of fiduciary duty by officers or directors of us; or (iii) arising out of the Nevada Revised Statutes, and establishing more detailed disclosure in any stockholder's advance notice to nominate a new member of the board, including specified information regarding such nominee, which may inhibit or deter such nomination and lengthen the time needed to elect a new majority of the board.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act and may take advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, most significantly, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for so long as we are an emerging growth company. As a result, if we elect not to comply with such auditor attestation requirements, our investors may not have access to certain information they may deem important.\nThe JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company does not need to comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards until such date that a private company is otherwise required to comply with such new or revised accounting standards. However, we have elected not to \u201copt out\u201d of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards as required when they are adopted for private companies. This decision to take advantage of the extended transition period under the JOBS Act is irrevocable.\nWe will incur increased costs as a result of operating as a smaller reporting public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a smaller reporting public company, and particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which in turn could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors.\nFor as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies as described in the preceding risk factor. We might remain an emerging growth company until March 31, 2023, although if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time or if we have annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more in any fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of December 31 of the applicable year. We also would cease to be an emerging growth company if we issue more than $1 billion of nonconvertible debt over a three-year period.\nPursuant to Section 404, we will be required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting, including an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. However, while we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the market price for our common stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If research analysts do not establish and maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the market price for our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which, in turn, could cause the market price or trading volume for our common stock to decline.\nBecause we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, you must rely on price appreciation of our common stock for return on your investment.\nWe currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Therefore, you should not rely on an investment in our common stock as a source for any future dividend income.\nOur board of directors has discretion as to whether to distribute dividends, subject to certain restrictions under Nevada law. Even if our board of directors decides to declare and pay dividends, the timing, amount and form of future dividends, if any, will depend on, among other things, our future results of operations and cash flow, our capital requirements and surplus, the amount of distributions, if any, received by us from our subsidiary, our financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Accordingly, the return on your investment in our common stock will likely depend entirely upon any future price appreciation of our common stock.\nThe exercise of outstanding warrants to acquire shares of our common stock would cause additional dilution, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIn the past, we have issued warrants to acquire shares of our common stock. As of the date of this Report, there were 1,519,602 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants at a weighted average exercise price of $1.76 per share, and we may issue additional options, warrants and other types of equity in the future as part of stock-based compensation, capital raising transactions or other strategic transactions. To the extent these options and warrants are ultimately exercised, existing holders of our common stock would experience dilution which may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe may need additional financing while the Warrants from the June 2019 Offering are still outstanding and certain of the terms of the June 2019 Offering could severely limit the types of financings we can enter into.\nUnder the terms of the Purchase Agreement we entered into in connection with the June 2019 Offering, we are prohibited from, among other things, (i) entering into any variable rate transactions so long as any of the Warrants issued in such offering are still outstanding, (ii) directly or indirectly offering or issuing any securities, or entering into any agreement to offer or issue any securities, other than customary exception, for a period of ninety (90) days after the closing of the June 2019 Offering. Such restrictions are severe limitation on the types of financings we can seek should we need it in the near future. In the event we will require such a financing, we may be required to obtain the consent of the investors in the June 2019 Offering, whom may withhold such consent at their reasonable discretion. Our inability, under the terms of the June 2019 Offering, to raise additional funds, could have a material adverse effect on our operations should we need such additional funds. Further, even if the Investors did provide us with their consent to obtain such additional financing, the terms of the financing may be under terms that are less advantageous due to the restrictions and protections provided under the terms of the June 2019 Offering.", "PERMNO": 17345, "SIC": 6159, "TIC": "AIHS"}
