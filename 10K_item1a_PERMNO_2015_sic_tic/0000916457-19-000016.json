Unlike most other commodities, power can only be stored on a very limited basis and generally must be produced concurrently with its use. As a result, power prices are subject to significant volatility due to supply and demand imbalances,\nespecially in the day-ahead and spot markets. Long- and short-term power and natural gas prices may also fluctuate substantially due to other factors outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nincreases and decreases in generation capacity in our markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in power transmission or fuel transportation capacity constraints or inefficiencies;\n\u2022\nvolatile weather conditions, particularly unusually hot or mild summers or unusually cold or warm winters in our market areas;\n\u2022\nquarterly and seasonal fluctuations;\n\u2022\nan economic downturn which could negatively affect demand for power;\n\u2022\nchanges in the supply of commodities utilized as fuel sources for power generation, including but not limited to coal, natural gas and fuel oil;\n\u2022\ntechnological shifts resulting in changes in the demand for power or in patterns of power usage, including the potential development of demand-side management tools and practices and the development of new fuels or new technologies for the production or storage of power;\n\u2022\nfederal and state power, market and environmental regulation and legislation, including mandating an RPS or creating financial incentives, each resulting in new renewable energy generation capacity creating oversupply;\n\u2022\nchanges in prices related to RECs and other environmental allowance products; and\n\u2022\nchanges in capacity prices and capacity markets.\nThese factors have caused our operating results to fluctuate in the past and will continue to cause them to do so in the future.\nOur revenues and results of operations depend on market rules, regulation and other forces beyond our control.\nOur revenues and results of operations are influenced by factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nrate caps, price limitations and bidding rules imposed by ISOs, RTOs and other market regulators that may impair our ability to recover our costs and limit our return on our capital investments;\n\u2022\nregulations promulgated by the FERC and the CFTC;\n\u2022\nsufficient liquidity in the forward commodity markets to conduct our hedging activities;\n\u2022\nsome of our competitors (mainly utilities) receive entitlement-guaranteed rates of return on their capital investments, with returns that exceed market returns and may affect our ability to sell our power at economical rates;\n\u2022\nstructure and operating characteristics of our capacity markets such as the PJM and ISO-NE capacity auctions and the NYISO markets; and\n\u2022\nregulations and market rules related to our RECs.\nAccounting for our hedging activities may increase the volatility in our quarterly and annual financial results.\nWe engage in commodity-related marketing and price-risk management activities in order to economically hedge our forward commodity market price risk exposure utilizing both physical and financial commodity purchases and sales commitments. Some of these contracts are accounted for as derivatives under U.S. GAAP, which requires us to record the fair value of the commitment on the balance sheet with changes in the fair value of all derivatives reflected within current period earnings. As a result, we are unable to accurately predict the effect that our risk management decisions may have on our quarterly and annual financial results.\nThe use of hedging agreements may not work as planned or fully protect us and could result in financial losses.\nIn accordance with internal policies and procedures designed to monitor hedging activities and positions, we enter into hedging agreements, including contracts to purchase or sell commodities at future dates and at fixed prices, in order to manage our commodity price risks. These activities, although intended to mitigate price volatility, expose us to risks related to commodity price movements, deviations in weather and other risks. When we sell power forward, we may be required to post significant amounts of cash collateral or other credit support to our counterparties, and we give up the opportunity to sell power at higher prices if spot prices are higher in the future. Further, if the values of the financial contracts change in a manner that we do not\nanticipate, or if a counterparty or customer fails to perform under a contract, it could harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe do not typically hedge the entire exposure of our operations against commodity price volatility. To the extent we do not hedge against commodity price volatility, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be diminished based upon adverse movement in commodity prices.\nOur ability to enter into hedging agreements and manage our counterparty and customer credit risk could adversely affect us.\nOur wholesale counterparties, retail customers and suppliers may experience deteriorating credit. These conditions could cause counterparties in the natural gas and power markets, particularly in the energy commodity derivative markets that we rely on for our hedging activities, to withdraw from participation in those markets. If multiple parties withdraw from those markets, market liquidity may be threatened, which in turn could adversely affect our business and create more volatility in our earnings. Additionally, these conditions may cause our counterparties or customers to seek bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 or liquidation under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Our credit risk may be exacerbated to the extent collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the exposure due to us. There can be no assurance that any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of our financial assets would not materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nExtensive competition in our wholesale and retail businesses could adversely affect our performance.\nThe power generation industry is characterized by intense competition, and we encounter competition from utilities, industrial companies, marketing and trading companies and other independent power producers. This competition has put pressure on power utilities to lower their costs, including the cost of purchased power, and increasing competition in the supply of power in the future could increase this pressure. In addition, construction during the last decade has created excess power supply and higher reserve margins in the power trading markets, putting downward pressure on prices.\nOther companies we compete with may have greater liquidity, greater access to credit and other financial resources, lower cost structures, greater ability to incur losses, longer-standing relationships with customers, greater potential for profitability from ancillary services or greater flexibility in the timing of their sale of generation capacity and ancillary services than we do.\nAdditionally, there is extensive competition in the retail power markets in which our retail subsidiaries operate. Competitors may offer lower prices or other incentives which may attract customers away from our retail subsidiaries. We may also face competition from a number of other energy service providers, other energy industry participants, or nationally branded providers of consumer products and services who may develop businesses that will compete with our retail subsidiaries.\nIn certain situations, our PPAs and other contractual arrangements, including construction agreements, commodity contracts, maintenance agreements and other arrangements, may be terminated by the counterparty or customer and/or may allow the counterparty or customer to seek liquidated damages.\nThe situations that could allow a counterparty or customer to terminate the contract and/or seek liquidated damages include:\n\u2022\nthe cessation or abandonment of the development, construction, maintenance or operation of a power plant;\n\u2022\nfailure of a power plant to achieve construction milestones or commercial operation by agreed-upon deadlines;\n\u2022\nfailure of a power plant to achieve certain output or efficiency minimums;\n\u2022\nour failure to make any of the payments owed to the counterparty or to establish, maintain, restore, extend the term of or increase any required collateral;\n\u2022\nfailure of a power plant to obtain material permits and regulatory approvals by agreed-upon deadlines;\n\u2022\na material breach of a representation or warranty or our failure to observe, comply with or perform any other material obligation under the contract; or\n\u2022\nevents of liquidation, dissolution, insolvency or bankruptcy.\nRevenue may be reduced significantly upon expiration or termination of our PPAs.\nSome of the capacity from our existing portfolio is sold under long-term PPAs that expire at various times. We seek to sell any capacity not sold under long-term PPAs, on a short-term basis as market opportunities arise. Our non-contracted capacity\nis generally sold on the spot market at current market prices as merchant energy. When the terms of each of our various PPAs expire, it is possible that the price paid to us for the generation of power under subsequent arrangements or in short-term markets may be significantly less than the price that had been paid to us under the PPA. Without the benefit of long-term PPAs, we may not be able to sell any or all of the capacity from these power plants at commercially attractive rates and these power plants may not be able to operate profitably. Certain of our PPAs have values in excess of current market prices. If a counterparty to a PPA were to seek bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 or liquidation under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, they may be able to terminate the PPA. We are at risk of loss of margins to the extent that these contracts expire or are terminated and we are unable to replace them on comparable terms.\nFor example, our wholesale business currently has contracts with investor owned California utilities which could be affected should they be found liable for recent wildfires in California and, accordingly, incur substantial costs associated with the wildfires.\nOn January 29, 2019, PG&E and PG&E Corporation each filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11. We currently have several power plants that provide energy and energy-related products to PG&E under PPAs, many of which have PG&E collateral posting requirements. Since the bankruptcy filing, we have received all material payments under the PPAs, either directly or through the application of collateral. We also currently have numerous other agreements with PG&E related to the operation of our power plants in Northern California, under which PG&E has continued to provide service since its bankruptcy filing. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter and continue to monitor the bankruptcy proceedings. However, should the outcome in the matter be unfavorable, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe introduction or expansion of competing technologies for power generation and demand-side management tools could adversely affect our performance.\nThe power generation business has seen a substantial change in the technologies used to produce power. With federal and state incentives for the development and production of renewable sources of power, we have seen market penetration of competing technologies, such as wind, solar, and commercial-sized power storage. Additionally, the development of demand-side management tools and practices can effect peak demand requirements for some of our markets at certain times during the year. The continued development of subsidized, competing power generation technologies and significant development of demand-side management tools and practices could alter the market and price structure for power and negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPower Operations\nOur power generating operations performance involves significant risks and hazards and may be below expected levels of output or efficiency.\nThe operation of power plants involves risks, including the breakdown or failure of power generation equipment, transmission lines, pipelines or other equipment or processes, performance below expected levels of output or efficiency and risks related to the creditworthiness of our contract counterparties and the creditworthiness of our counterparties\u2019 customers or other parties, such as steam hosts, with whom our counterparties have contracted. From time to time our power plants have experienced unplanned outages, including extensions of scheduled outages due to equipment breakdowns, failures or other problems which are an inherent risk of our business. Unplanned outages typically can result in lost revenues, inability to perform and potential recognition of liquidated damages owed and/or termination of existing long-term PPAs, increase our maintenance expenses and may reduce our profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be subject to future claims, litigation and enforcement.\nOur power generating operations are inherently hazardous and may lead to catastrophic events, including loss of life, personal injury and destruction of property, and subject us to litigation. Natural gas is highly explosive and power generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and delivering fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering power to transmission and distribution systems. These and other hazards can cause severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and suspension of operations. In the worst circumstances, catastrophic events can cause significant personal injury or loss of life. Further, the occurrence of any one of these events may result in us being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we consider adequate; however, we cannot provide any assurance that the insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we are subject.\nAdditionally, we are party to various litigation matters, including regulatory and administrative proceedings arising out of the normal course of business. We review our litigation activities and determine if an unfavorable outcome to us is considered \u201cremote,\u201d \u201creasonably possible\u201d or \u201cprobable\u201d as defined by U.S. GAAP. Where we have determined an unfavorable outcome is probable and is reasonably estimable, we accrue for potential litigation losses. A successful claim against us that is not fully insured could be material. The liability we may ultimately incur with respect to such litigation matters, in the event of a negative outcome, may be in excess of amounts currently accrued, if any. Where we determine an unfavorable outcome is not probable or reasonably estimable, we do not accrue for any potential litigation loss. The ultimate outcome of these litigation matters cannot presently be determined, nor can the liability that could potentially result from a negative outcome be reasonably estimated. As a result, we give no assurance that such litigation matters would, individually or in the aggregate, not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See also Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our more significant litigation matters.\nWe rely on power transmission and fuel distribution facilities owned and operated by other companies.\nWe depend on facilities and assets that we do not own or control for the transmission to our customers of the power produced by our power plants and the distribution of natural gas or fuel oil to our power plants. If these transmission and distribution systems are disrupted or capacity on those systems is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver power products or obtain fuel may be hindered. ISOs that oversee transmission systems in regional power markets have imposed price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in their power markets. Existing congestion, as well as expansion of transmission systems, could affect our performance, which in turn could adversely affect our business.\nOur power project development and construction activities involve risk and may not be successful.\nThe development and construction of power plants is subject to substantial risks. In connection with the development of a power plant, we must generally obtain:\n\u2022\nnecessary power generation equipment;\n\u2022\ngovernmental permits and approvals including environmental permits and approvals;\n\u2022\nfuel supply and transportation agreements;\n\u2022\nsufficient equity capital and debt financing;\n\u2022\npower transmission agreements;\n\u2022\nwater supply and wastewater discharge agreements or permits; and\n\u2022\nsite agreements and construction contracts.\nTo the extent that our development and construction activities continue or expand, we may be unsuccessful on a timely and profitable basis. Although we may attempt to minimize the financial risks of these activities by securing a favorable PPA and arranging adequate financing prior to the commencement of construction, the development of a power project may require us to expend significant cash sums for preliminary engineering, permitting, legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible, economically attractive or financeable. The process for obtaining governmental permits and approvals is complicated and lengthy, often taking more than one year, and is subject to significant uncertainties. We may be unable to obtain all necessary licenses, permits, approvals and certificates for proposed projects, and completed power plants may not comply with all applicable permit conditions, statutes or regulations. In addition, regulatory compliance for the construction and operation of our power plants can be a costly and time-consuming process. Intricate and changing environmental and other regulatory requirements may necessitate substantial expenditures to obtain and maintain permits. If a project is unable to function as planned due to changing requirements, loss of required permits or regulatory status or local opposition, it may create expensive delays, extended periods of non-operation or significant loss of value in a project resulting in potential impairments.\nWe may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of fuel in the future.\nWe obtain substantially all of our physical natural gas and fuel oil supply from third parties pursuant to arrangements that vary in term, pricing structure, firmness and delivery flexibility. Our physical natural gas and fuel oil supply arrangements must be coordinated with transportation agreements, balancing agreements, storage services, financial hedging transactions and other contracts so that the natural gas and fuel oil is delivered to our power plants at the times, in the quantities and otherwise in a manner that meets the needs of our generation portfolio and our customers. We must also comply with laws and regulations governing natural gas transportation.\nAdditionally, the PJM power market has recently experienced an increase in natural gas-fired generation assets that supply electricity to the area. As a result, there has been a corresponding increase in the need for natural gas transmission assets to supply the generation assets with fuel to generate power. When extreme cold temperatures rapidly increase the demand for natural gas used for residential heating, it can also create constraints on natural gas pipelines that serve power generation assets. When these conditions exist, it could interrupt the fuel supply to our natural gas-fired power plants in the PJM power market, although some of our natural gas-fired power plants in this region are dual-fuel and benefit from the ability to operate on both natural gas and fuel oil.\nWhile adequate supplies of natural gas and fuel oil are currently available to us at prices we believe are reasonable for each of our power plants, we are exposed to increases in the price of natural gas and fuel oil, and it is possible that sufficient supplies to operate our portfolio profitably may not continue to be available to us. In addition, we face risks with regard to the delivery to and the use of natural gas and fuel oil by our power plants including the following:\n\u2022\ntransportation may be unavailable if pipeline infrastructure is damaged or disabled;\n\u2022\npipeline tariff changes may adversely affect our ability to, or cost to, deliver natural gas and fuel oil supply;\n\u2022\nthird-party suppliers may default on natural gas supply obligations, and we may be unable to replace supplies currently under contract;\n\u2022\nmarket liquidity for physical natural gas and fuel oil or availability of natural gas and fuel oil services (e.g. storage) may be insufficient or available only at prices that are not acceptable to us;\n\u2022\nnatural gas and fuel oil quality variation may adversely affect our power plant operations;\n\u2022\nour natural gas and fuel oil operations capability may be compromised due to various events such as natural disaster, loss of key personnel or loss of critical infrastructure;\n\u2022\nfuel supplies diverted to residential heating for humanitarian reasons; and\n\u2022\nany other reasons.\nOur power plants and construction projects are subject to impairments.\nIf we were to experience a significant reduction in our expected revenues and operating cash flows for an extended period of time from a prolonged economic downturn or from advances or changes in technologies, we could experience future impairments of our power plant assets as a result. There can be no assurance that any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of our financial assets would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur geothermal power reserves may be inadequate for our operations.\nIn connection with each geothermal power plant, we estimate the productivity of the geothermal resource and the expected decline in productivity. The productivity of a geothermal resource may decline more than anticipated, resulting in insufficient reserves being available for sustained generation of the power capacity desired. In addition, we may not be able to successfully manage the development and operation of our geothermal reservoirs or accurately estimate the quantity or productivity of our steam reserves. An incorrect estimate or inability to manage our geothermal reserves or a decline in productivity could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, the development and operation of geothermal power resources are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties. The successful exploitation of a geothermal power resource ultimately depends upon many factors including the following:\n\u2022\nthe heat content of the extractable steam or fluids;\n\u2022\nthe geology of the reservoir;\n\u2022\nthe total amount of recoverable reserves;\n\u2022\noperating expenses relating to the extraction of steam or fluids;\n\u2022\nprice levels relating to the extraction of steam, fluids or power generated; and\n\u2022\ncapital expenditure requirements relating primarily to the drilling of new wells.\nSignificant events beyond our control, such as natural disasters, including weather-related events and wildfires, or acts of terrorism (including cyber attacks), could damage our power plants or our corporate offices or cause a loss of system load and may affect us in unpredictable ways.\nCertain of our geothermal and natural gas-fired power plants, particularly in the West, are subject to frequent low-level seismic disturbances and a persistent risk of wildfires. More significant seismic disturbances are possible. In addition, other areas in which we operate, particularly in Texas and the Southeast, experience tornados and hurricanes. Operations at our corporate offices in Houston, Texas could be substantially affected by a hurricane. Any significant loss of system load resulting from a weather-related event or wildfires could negatively affect our wholesale business and retail subsidiaries. Such events could damage or shut down our power plants, power transmission or the fuel supply facilities upon which our wholesale business and retail subsidiaries are dependent. Our existing power plants are built to withstand relatively significant levels of seismic and other disturbances, and we believe we maintain adequate insurance protection. However, earthquake, property damage or business interruption insurance may be inadequate to cover all potential losses sustained in the event of serious damages to our power plants or disruptions to our wholesale and retail operations due to natural disasters.\nIn addition to physical damage to our power plants, the risk of future terrorist activity (including cyber attacks) could result in adverse changes in the insurance markets and disruptions in the power and fuel markets. These events could also adversely affect the U.S. economy, create instability in the financial markets and, as a result, have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital on terms and conditions acceptable to us.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages by unionized employees or by our inability to replace key employees.\nApproximately 7% of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. In the event that our union employees participate in a strike, work stoppage or engage in other forms of labor disruption, we would be responsible for procuring replacement labor and could experience reduced power generation or outages.\nIn addition, our success is largely dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our people. Our employees, including key personnel, may be uncertain about their future roles and relationships with us following the Merger, which may adversely affect our ability to retain them or to hire new employees. The loss of the services of one or more members of our senior management or of numerous employees with critical skills could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and future growth if we were unable to replace them.\nFailures in our systems or a cyber attack or breach of our information technology systems or technology could significantly disrupt our business operations or result in sensitive customer information being compromised, which would negatively materially affect our reputation and/or results of operations.\nOur information technology systems contain personal, financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, which makes us a target of cyber attacks on our systems. We rely on electronic networks, computers, systems, including our gateways, programs to run our business and operations, our employees and third party technology and information technology infrastructure providers and, as a result, are potentially exposed to the risk of security breaches, computer or other malware, viruses, social engineering or general hacking, industrial espionage, employee or third party error or malfeasance, or other irregularities or compromises on our systems or those to third parties, which could result in the loss or misappropriation of sensitive data or other disruption to our operations.\nWe depend on computer and telecommunications systems we do not own or control. We have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology services in connection with the operation of our power plants. In addition, we have developed proprietary software systems, management techniques and other information technologies incorporating software licensed from third parties. We also rely on software systems owned and operated by third parties, such as ISOs and RTOs, to be functioning in order to be able to transmit the electricity produced by our power plants to our customers. It is possible that we, or a third party that we rely on, could incur interruptions from a loss of communications, hardware or software failures, a cyber attack or a breach of our information technology systems or technology, computer viruses or malware. We believe that we have positive relations with our vendors and maintain adequate anti-virus and malware software and controls; however, any interruptions to our arrangements with third parties, to our computing and communications\ninfrastructure, or to our information systems or any of those operated by a third party that we rely on could significantly disrupt our business operations.\nA cyber attack on our systems or networks that impairs our information technology systems could disrupt our business operations and result in loss of service to customers. We have a comprehensive cybersecurity program designed to protect and preserve the integrity of our information technology systems. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience actual or attempted cyber attacks on our information technology systems or networks; however, none of these actual or attempted cyber attacks has had a material effect on our operations or financial condition. Even when a security breach is detected, the full extent of the breach may not be determined for some time. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through a cyber attack or a cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has magnified as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world has increased. An increasing number of companies have disclosed security breaches of their information technology systems and networks, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks. We believe such incidents are likely to continue, and we are unable to predict the direct or indirect effect of any future attacks on our business.\nAdditionally, our retail subsidiaries require access to sensitive customer information in the ordinary course of business. If a significant data breach occurred, the reputation of our retail subsidiaries may be adversely affected, customer confidence may be diminished, and our retail subsidiaries may become subject to legal claims, any of which may contribute to the loss of customers and have a material adverse effect on our retail subsidiaries.\nCapital Resources; Liquidity\nWe have substantial liquidity needs and could face liquidity pressure.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our consolidated debt outstanding was $10.8 billion, of which approximately $8.4 billion was outstanding under our Senior Unsecured Notes, First Lien Term Loans and First Lien Notes. In addition, we had $1,365 million issued in letters of credit and our pro rata share of unconsolidated subsidiary debt was approximately $151 million. Although we significantly extended our maturities during the last several years, we could face liquidity challenges as we continue to have substantial debt and substantial liquidity needs in the operation of our business. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, to meet margin requirements and to fund planned capital expenditures and development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from our operations and our ability to access the capital markets. This, to a certain extent, is dependent upon industry conditions, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, as discussed further in \u201c- Commercial Operations\u201d above.\nWe also have exposure to many different financial institutions and counterparties including those under our Senior Unsecured Notes, First Lien Term Loans, First Lien Notes, Corporate Revolving Facility and other credit and financing arrangements as we routinely execute transactions in connection with our hedging and optimization activities, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutions and industry participants. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event that any of our lenders or counterparties are unable to honor their commitments or otherwise default under a financing agreement. See additional discussion regarding our capital resources and liquidity in Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and limit our operations.\nOur indebtedness has important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, potential growth or other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to use operating cash flows in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service our debt;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures and adverse changes in governmental regulation;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability or increasing the costs to refinance indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to enter into marketing, hedging and optimization activities by reducing the number of counterparties with whom we can transact as well as the volume and type of those transactions.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional financing or access the credit and capital markets in the future at prices that are beneficial to us or at all.\nIf our available cash, including future cash flows generated from operations, is not sufficient in the near term to finance our operations, post collateral or satisfy our obligations as they become due, we may need to access the capital and credit markets. Our ability to arrange financing (including any extension or refinancing) and the cost of the financing is dependent upon numerous factors, including general economic and capital market conditions. Market disruptions such as those experienced in the U.S. and abroad in recent years, may increase our cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access capital. Other factors include:\n\u2022\nlow credit ratings may prevent us from obtaining any material amount of additional debt financing;\n\u2022\nconditions in energy commodity markets;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments;\n\u2022\ncredit availability from banks or other lenders for us and our industry peers;\n\u2022\ninvestor confidence in the industry and in us;\n\u2022\nthe continued reliable operation of our current power plants; and\n\u2022\nprovisions of tax, regulatory and securities laws that are conducive to raising capital.\nWhile we have utilized non-recourse or lease financing when appropriate, market conditions and other factors may prevent us from completing similar financings in the future. It is possible that we may be unable to obtain the financing required to develop, construct, acquire or expand power plants on terms satisfactory to us. We have financed our existing power plants using a variety of leveraged financing structures, including senior secured and unsecured indebtedness, construction financing, project financing, term loans and lease obligations. In the event of a default under a financing agreement which we do not cure, the lenders or lessors would generally have rights to the power plant and any related assets. In the event of foreclosure after a default, we may not be able to retain any interest in the power plant or other collateral supporting such financing. In addition, any such default or foreclosure may trigger cross default provisions in our other financing agreements.\nOur Senior Unsecured Notes, First Lien Term Loans, First Lien Notes, Corporate Revolving Facility, CCFC Term Loan and our other debt instruments impose restrictions on us and any failure to comply with these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our operations.\nThe restrictions under our Senior Unsecured Notes, First Lien Term Loans, First Lien Notes, Corporate Revolving Facility, CCFC Term Loan and other debt instruments could adversely affect us by limiting our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs and, if we were unable to comply with these restrictions, could result in an event of default under these debt instruments. These restrictions require us to meet certain financial performance tests on a quarterly basis and limit or prohibit our ability, subject to certain exceptions to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional first lien indebtedness up to certain consolidated net tangible asset ratios;\n\u2022\nenter into certain types of commodity hedge agreements that can be secured by first lien collateral;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge with or transfer all or substantially all of our assets to another entity, or allow substantially all of our subsidiaries to do so;\n\u2022\nlease, transfer or sell assets and use proceeds of permitted asset leases, transfers or sales;\n\u2022\nengage in certain business activities; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nOur Senior Unsecured Notes, First Lien Term Loans, First Lien Notes, Corporate Revolving Facility, CCFC Term Loan and our other debt instruments contain events of default customary for financings of their type, including a cross default to debt other than non-recourse project financing debt, a cross-acceleration to non-recourse project financing debt and certain change of control events. If we fail to comply with the covenants and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, or a default exists and is continuing under such debt, the lenders or the holders or trustee, as applicable, could give notice and declare outstanding borrowings and other obligations under such debt immediately due and payable.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing or to reduce expenditures. We may not be able to obtain such waivers, amendments or alternative financing, or if obtainable, it could be on terms that are not acceptable to us. If we are unable to comply with the terms of our Senior Unsecured Notes, First Lien Term Loans, First Lien Notes, Corporate Revolving Facility, CCFC Term Loan and our other debt instruments, or if we fail to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or if it becomes necessary to obtain such waivers, amendments or alternative financing, it could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur credit status is below investment grade, which may restrict our operations, increase our liquidity requirements and restrict financing opportunities.\nThere are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for us and our subsidiaries, including regulatory framework, ability to recover costs and earn returns, diversification, financial strength and liquidity. If one or more rating agencies downgrade us, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases and other agreements.\nOur corporate and debt credit ratings are below investment grade. There is no assurance that our credit ratings will improve in the future, which may restrict the financing opportunities available to us or may increase the cost of any available financing. Our current credit rating has resulted in the requirement that we provide additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash for credit support obligations and may adversely affect our subsidiaries\u2019 and our financial position and results of operations.\nCertain of our obligations are required to be secured by letters of credit or cash, which increase our costs; if we are unable to provide such security it may restrict our ability to conduct our business.\nCompanies using derivatives, which include many commodity contracts, are subject to the inherent risks of such transactions. Consequently, many such companies, including us, may be required to post cash collateral for certain commodity transactions; and, the level of collateral will increase as a company increases its hedging activities. We use margin deposits, prepayments and letters of credit as credit support for commodity procurement and risk management activities. Future cash collateral requirements may increase based on the extent of our involvement in standard contracts and movements in commodity prices, and also based on our credit ratings and general perception of creditworthiness in this market. Certain of our financing arrangements for our power plants have required us to post letters of credit which are at risk of being drawn down in the event we, or the applicable subsidiary, default on our obligations.\nMany of our collateral agreements require that letters of credit posted as collateral must be issued by a financial institution with a minimum credit rating of \u201cA\u201d. Currently the financial institutions that issue letters of credit under our Corporate Revolving Facility and other letter of credit facilities meet or exceed the minimum credit rating criteria. However, if one or more of these financial institutions is no longer able to meet the minimum credit rating criteria, then we could be required to post collateral funding from our cash and cash equivalents which could negatively affect our liquidity.\nThese letter of credit and cash collateral requirements increase our cost of doing business and could have an adverse effect on our overall liquidity, particularly if there was a call for a large amount of additional cash or letter of credit collateral due to an unexpectedly large movement in the market price of a commodity. As of December 31, 2018, we had $1,365 million issued in letters of credit under our Corporate Revolving Facility and other facilities, with $966 million remaining available for borrowing or for letter of credit support under our Corporate Revolving Facility. In addition, we have ratably secured our obligations under certain of our power and natural gas agreements that qualify as eligible commodity hedge agreements with the assets subject to liens under our First Lien Notes, First Lien Term Loans and Corporate Revolving Facility.\nAdditionally, changes in market regulations can increase the use of credit support and collateral.\nWe may not have sufficient liquidity to hedge market risks effectively.\nWe are exposed to market risks through our purchase and sale of power, capacity and related products, fuel, transmission services and emission allowances. These market risks include, among other risks, volatility arising from location and timing differences that may be associated with buying and transporting fuel, converting fuel into power and delivering the power to a buyer.\nWe undertake these activities through agreements with various counterparties, many of which require us to provide guarantees, offset or netting arrangements, letters of credit, a second lien on assets and/or cash collateral to protect the counterparties\nagainst the risk of our default or insolvency. The amount of such credit support that must be provided typically is based on the difference between the price of the commodity in a given contract and the market price of the commodity. Significant movements in market prices can result in our being required to provide cash collateral and letters of credit in very large amounts. The effectiveness of our strategy may be dependent on the amount of collateral available to enter into or maintain these contracts, and liquidity requirements may be greater than we anticipate or will be able to meet. Without a sufficient amount of working capital to post as collateral in support of performance guarantees or as a cash margin, we may not be able to manage price volatility effectively or to implement our strategy. An increase in the amount of letters of credit or cash collateral required to be provided to our counterparties may negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nFurther, if any of our power plants experience unplanned outages, we may be required to procure replacement power at spot market prices in order to fulfill contractual commitments. Without adequate liquidity to meet margin and collateral requirements, we may be exposed to significant losses, may miss significant opportunities and may have increased exposure to the volatility of spot markets.\nOur ability to receive future cash flows generated from the operation of our subsidiaries may be limited.\nAlmost all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and other affiliates. As a result, we depend almost entirely upon their earnings and cash flows to service our indebtedness, post collateral and finance our ongoing operations. Certain of our project debt and other agreements restrict our ability to receive dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries. Some of these limitations are subject to a number of significant exceptions (including exceptions permitting such restrictions in connection with certain subsidiary financings). Accordingly, the financing agreements of certain of our subsidiaries and other affiliates generally restrict their ability to pay dividends, make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us prior to the payment of their other obligations, including their outstanding debt, operating expenses, lease payments and reserves or during the existence of a default.\nWe may utilize project financing, preferred equity and other types of subsidiary financing transactions when appropriate in the future, which could increase our debt and may be structurally senior to other debt such as our First Lien Term Loans, First Lien Notes and Corporate Revolving Facility.\nOur ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness are limited in some cases by existing indentures, debt instruments or other agreements. Our subsidiaries may incur additional construction/project financing indebtedness, issue preferred equity to finance the acquisition and development of new power plants and engage in certain types of non-recourse financings to the extent permitted by existing agreements, and may continue to do so in order to fund our ongoing operations. Any such newly incurred subsidiary preferred equity would be added to our current consolidated debt levels and would likely be structurally senior to our debt, which could also intensify the risks associated with our already existing leverage.\nOur First Lien Term Loans, First Lien Notes and Corporate Revolving Facility are effectively subordinated to certain project indebtedness.\nCertain of our subsidiaries and other affiliates are separate and distinct legal entities and, except in limited circumstances, have no obligation to pay any amounts due with respect to our indebtedness or indebtedness of other subsidiaries or affiliates, and do not guarantee the payment of interest on or principal of such indebtedness. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization (or the bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of a subsidiary or affiliate), such subsidiaries\u2019 or other affiliates\u2019 creditors, including trade creditors and holders of debt issued by such subsidiaries or affiliates, will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries or affiliates before any assets are made available for distribution to us or the holders of our indebtedness. As a result, holders of our indebtedness will be effectively subordinated to all present and future debts and other liabilities (including trade payables) of certain of our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2018, our subsidiaries had approximately $1.0 billion in debt from our CCFC subsidiary and approximately $1.3 billion in secured project financing from other subsidiaries, which are effectively senior to our First Lien Term Loans, First Lien Notes and Corporate Revolving Facility. We may incur additional project financing indebtedness in the future, which will be effectively senior to our other secured and unsecured debt.\nGovernmental Regulation\nFederal tax incentives and regulations, existing and proposed state RPS and energy efficiency standards, as well as economic support for renewable sources of power under federal or state legislation could adversely affect our operations.\nRenewables have the ability to take market share from us and to lower overall wholesale power prices which could negatively affect us. The Consolidated Appropriations Act which extended the production tax credit for wind through the end of 2016 with gradual decreases thereafter until the tax credit expires completely in 2019 and extended the 30% investment tax credit\nfor solar through the end of 2019 with gradual decreases through 2021 after which the investment tax credit declines to 10% was enacted in December 2015. California has a RPS in effect and recently enacted legislation requiring implementation of a 100% CO2-free energy requirement by 2030. A number of additional states, including Maine, New York, Texas and Wisconsin, have an array of different RPS in place. Existing state-specific RPS requirements may change due to regulatory and/or legislative initiatives, and other states may consider implementing enforceable RPS in the future. A more robust RPS in states in which we are active, coupled with federal tax incentives, would likely initially drive up the number of wind and solar resources, increasing power supply to various markets which could negatively affect the dispatch of our natural gas-fired power plants, primarily in Texas and California.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Department of Energy (\u201cDOE\u201d) has initiated a formal inter-agency review process to consider possible action under Section 202(c) of the FPA and the Defense Production Act to ensure the continued operation of certain fuel-secure electric generation capacity, consisting of nuclear and coal-fired power plants across the U.S. facing retirement.\nSimilarly, several states have energy efficiency initiatives in place while others are considering imposing them. Improved energy efficiency when mandated by law or promoted by government sponsored incentives can decrease demand for power which could negatively affect the dispatch of our natural gas-fired power plants, primarily in Texas and California.\nIncreased oversight and investigation by the CFTC relating to derivative transactions, as well as certain financial institutions, could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business.\nThe CFTC has regulatory oversight of the futures markets, including trading on NYMEX for energy, and licensed futures professionals such as brokers, clearing members and large traders. In connection with its oversight of the futures markets and NYMEX, the CFTC regularly investigates market irregularities and potential manipulation of those markets. Recent laws also give the CFTC certain powers with respect to broker-type markets referred to as \u201cexempt commercial markets\u201d or ECMs, including the Intercontinental Exchange. The CFTC monitors activities in the OTC, ECM and physical markets that may be undertaken for the purpose of influencing futures prices. With respect to ECMs, the CFTC exercises only light-handed regulation primarily related to trade reporting, price dissemination and record retention (including retention of fraudulent claims and allegations).\nChanges in the regulation of the power markets in which we operate could negatively affect us.\nWe have a significant presence in the major competitive power markets for California, Texas and the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. While these markets are largely deregulated, they continue to evolve. Existing regulations within the markets in which we operate may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws or regulations may be issued. We cannot predict the future development of regulation or legislation nor the ultimate effect such changes in these markets could have on our business; however, we could be negatively affected.\nState legislative and regulatory action could adversely affect our competitive position and business.\nCertain states have taken or are considering taking anticompetitive actions by subsidizing or otherwise providing economic support to existing, uneconomic power plants in a manner that could have an adverse effect on the deregulated power markets. In addition, certain states in which we have retail operations are taking actions which we believe limit customer choice as well as other actions that we believe are anticompetitive and could negatively affect our retail operations. We are actively participating in many of the legislative, regulatory and judicial processes challenging these actions at the state and federal levels. If these anticompetitive actions are ultimately upheld and implemented, they could adversely affect capacity and energy prices in the deregulated electricity markets or impede our ability to maintain or expand our retail operations which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects and financial results.\nExisting and future anticipated GHG/Carbon and other environmental regulations could cause us to incur significant costs and adversely affect our operations generally or in a particular quarter when such costs are incurred.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations have generally become more stringent over time, and this trend is likely to continue. In particular, there is a potential that carbon taxes or limits on carbon, CO2 and other GHG emissions could be implemented at the federal or expanded at the state or regional levels. We continue to monitor and actively participate in the EPA initiatives where we anticipate a material effect on our business.\nCurrently, nine states in the Northeast are required to comply with a Cap-and-Trade program, RGGI, to regulate CO2 emissions from power plants. California has implemented AB 32 which places a statewide cap on GHG emissions and requires the state to return to 1990 emission levels by 2020. In December 2010, the CARB adopted a regulation establishing a GHG Cap-and- Trade program which is in effect for electric utilities and other \u201cmajor industrial sources,\u201d and in 2015 for certain other GHG\nsources including transportation fuels and natural gas distribution. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection issued a final rule in August 2017 that imposes new GHG limits on power plants and other sources.\nWe are subject to other complex governmental regulation which could adversely affect our operations.\nGenerally, in the U.S., we are subject to regulation by the FERC regarding the terms and conditions of wholesale service and the sale and transportation of natural gas, as well as by state agencies regarding physical aspects of the power plants. The majority of our generation is sold at market prices under the market-based rate authority granted by the FERC. If certain conditions are not met, FERC has the authority to withhold or rescind market-based rate authority and require sales to be made based on cost-of-service rates. A loss of our market-based rate authority could have a materially negative effect on our generation business. FERC could also impose fines or other restrictions or requirements on us under certain circumstances.\nThe construction and operation of power plants require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from the appropriate foreign, federal, state and local governmental agencies, as well as compliance with numerous environmental laws and regulations of federal, state and local authorities. We could also be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities, including the retirement of certain generating plants, based on these regulations. Should we fail to comply with any environmental requirements that apply to power plant construction or operations, we could be subject to administrative, civil and/or criminal liability and fines, and regulatory agencies could take other actions to curtail our operations.\nFurthermore, certain environmental laws impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise released. We are generally responsible for all liabilities associated with the environmental condition of our power plants, including any soil or groundwater contamination that may be present, regardless of when the liabilities arose and whether the liabilities are known or unknown, or arose from the activities of predecessors or third parties.\nIf we were deemed to have market power in certain markets as a result of the ownership of our stock by certain significant owners, we could lose FERC authorization to sell power at wholesale at market-based rates in such markets or be required to engage in mitigation in those markets.\nCertain of our significant ownership groups own power generating assets, or own significant equity interests in entities with power generating assets, in markets where we currently own power plants. We could be determined to have market power if these existing significant owners acquire additional significant ownership or equity interest in other entities with power generating assets in the same markets where we generate and sell power.\nIf the FERC makes the determination that we have market power, the FERC could, among other things, revoke market-based rate authority for the affected market-based companies or order them to mitigate that market power. If market-based rate authority was revoked for any of our market-based rate companies, those companies would be required to make wholesale sales of power based on cost-of-service rates, which could negatively affect their revenues. If we are required to mitigate market power, we could be required to sell certain power plants in regions where we are determined to have market power. A loss of our market-based rate authority or required sales of power plants, particularly if it affected several of our power plants or was in a significant market, could have a material negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 92530, "SIC": 4991, "TIC": "8356B"}
