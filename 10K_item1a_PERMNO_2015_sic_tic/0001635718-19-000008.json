{"cik": "1635718", "company": "Gannett Co., Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K, prospective investors should consider carefully the following risk factors before investing in our securities. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet perceive or that we currently believe are immaterial may adversely affect our business and the trading price of our securities.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nRisks Relating to Our Business Strategy\nWe may be unsuccessful in effectively implementing our business strategy or achieving all of its expected benefits.\nGannett\u2019s vision is to become the daily destination for consumers and marketers seeking meaningful connections with their communities across print, digital, and other channels. We are committed to a business strategy that is focused on driving audience growth and engagement by delivering deeper content experiences to our audience while offering the products and marketing expertise our advertisers desire. Accordingly, we have realigned our management team to focus on two primary areas: marketing solutions and consumer.\nOur ability to implement our strategy effectively is subject to several risks, including:\n\u2022\nThe strategy may require significant time and investment, and the investments may result in lower margins and increase our operating expenses or capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nThe reorganization of personnel, including senior executives, required to implement our strategy may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business. The failure to ensure a smooth transition and effective transfer of knowledge involving senior employees could hinder our strategic execution and succession planning;\n\u2022\nWe may be unsuccessful in recruiting and retaining the talent required to operate and grow our digital marketing solutions and content businesses or to internally develop related technologies. We expect to face competition for such talent from larger or more well established digital companies with a stronger digital brand association and greater resources; and\n\u2022\nThe technology required to support our digital marketing solutions or consumer businesses may be unavailable, and we may be unsuccessful in developing it internally.\nEven if we implement our strategy effectively, it may not produce an increase in digital revenues that sufficiently offsets the declines we are experiencing in our traditional print media business. If we fail to implement our strategy effectively or if our strategy ultimately does not yield a sufficient increase in digital revenues, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe reorganization of our sales force to better align with our business strategy may be disruptive to our operations, and it might not yield the long-term benefits we expect.\nIn 2018, we initiated a reorganization of our advertising sales organization to better align with our business strategy. The reorganization aims to better align our sales organization with the needs of our various client categories. As part of this effort, we launched LOCALiQ, a data-driven marketing solution designed to combine all of our online and offline advertising offerings into a comprehensive, simplified package.\nThe reorganization of our advertising sales organization is subject to several risks, including:\n\u2022\nThe reorganization may be disruptive to existing relationships with advertisers;\n\u2022\nWe may be unsuccessful in training our existing sales force on our entire suite of advertising products and services, including additional products or services we may add to our suite through acquisitions or internal development;\n\u2022\nWe may be unsuccessful in recruiting and retaining sales personnel with the knowledge and skills required to market our products and services effectively; and\n\u2022\nThe LOCALiQ brand may not achieve recognition in the market.\nIf the disruption caused by the sales reorganization persists longer than anticipated or we are unable to achieve the long-term benefits anticipated, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Publishing Segment\nOur publishing segment's operating results will be materially adversely affected if we do not respond successfully to the shift in our consumers\u2019 preferences, behaviors, and demographics away from traditional print and towards digital media and the associated shift in the allocation of advertising expenditures. Significant capital investments may be needed to respond to this shift.\nAdvances in technology have led to a proliferation of delivery methods for news and information. The number of consumers who access news and information online through personal computers, smartphones, handheld tablets, and mobile devices has increased dramatically over the past decade and likely will continue to increase. This trend is furthered by demographic shifts, with traditional print newspaper readers getting older and younger generations developing the habit of consuming news through digital media. As a result, the media industry has experienced rapid evolution in consumer demands and expectations. Presented with a multitude of media choices and sources of free information, consumers seem to be focusing\nmore on the convenience and price of content and less on the source, quality, or reliability of content. The consumption and acceptance of poorly-sourced news online and through social media has undercut certain competitive advantages that we possessed as a trusted provider of local news and information across the USA TODAY NETWORK and at Newsquest. As a result, the publishing business is generally characterized by declining print circulation revenues. In addition, the advertising revenues generated by media companies have been affected significantly by the shift in advertising expenditures towards digital media. Media companies generally charge much lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising due to the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space, and mobile advertising rates typically are even lower than desktop digital rates.\nOur success therefore depends on our ability to develop and manage our digital businesses in response to the shift in consumers\u2019 preferences, behavior, and demographics, as well as the related shift in the allocation of advertising expenditures as described above. In particular, we must continue to:\n\u2022\nIncrease digital audiences, grow the number of digital-only subscribers to our consumer products, and increase how much they pay for those products;\n\u2022\nAttract advertisers to our digital products;\n\u2022\nTailor our products for mobile devices;\n\u2022\nStructure our sales force to market our entire suite of advertising products and services, including print, digital display, and digital marketing services;\n\u2022\nAttract and retain employees with the skills and knowledge needed to successfully operate digital businesses;\n\u2022\nManage the transition to a digital business from historical print businesses, including by reducing the physical and distribution infrastructure and related fixed costs associated with those businesses;\n\u2022\nBroaden our content offerings to encompass offerings outside of the traditional news and information category; and\n\u2022\nInvest funds and resources in digital opportunities.\nIf we are unable to exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our publishing segment's products from those of our competitors, develop in a timely manner compelling new products that engage users across multiple platforms, expand our content offerings beyond the news and information category, or offer effective online and offline advertising solutions to our marketing clients, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. Responding to the changes described above may require us to make significant capital investments and incur significant research and development costs related to building, maintaining, and evolving our technology infrastructure, and our ability to make the level of investments required may be limited.\nAs digital revenues increase as a proportion of our total revenues, we will become increasingly subject to risks associated with digital media operations.\nAs we increasingly transition from traditional print businesses to digital media businesses, we expect our digital revenues to increase as a percentage of our total revenues in future periods. We therefore expect to face increasing risks related to our digital media operations, including:\n\u2022\nRates we achieve in the marketplace for the advertising inventory on our digital platforms may be adversely affected by:\n\u25e6\nNews aggregation websites and customized news feeds (often free to users), which may reduce our traffic levels by creating a disincentive for users to visit our websites or use our digital products;\n\u25e6\nOur inability to successfully manage changes in search engine optimization and social media traffic to increase our digital presence and visibility, which also may reduce our traffic levels; or\n\u25e6\nOur inability to maintain and improve the performance of our customers' advertising on our digital properties;\n\u2022\nOur use of subscription models (which requires users to pay for content after accessing a limited number of pages or news articles for free on our websites each month) or increases in the rates for digital subscriptions may cause consumers to opt out of subscription offers in greater numbers than anticipated or result in fewer page views or unique visitors to our websites than projected;\n\u2022\nTechnical or other problems could prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience, and users could develop negative views about the quality or usefulness of our products;\n\u2022\nNew delivery platforms may lead to pricing restrictions, loss of distribution control, or loss of direct relationships with consumers;\n\u2022\nMobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, may present challenges for traditional display advertising; and\n\u2022\nTechnology developed to block the display of advertising on websites could proliferate, impairing our ability to generate digital revenues.\nOur inability to respond successfully to these or similar challenges could materially adversely impact our ability to maintain and grow our digital revenues.\nOur media businesses operate in highly competitive markets, and our ability to maintain market share and generate operating revenues depends on how effectively we compete with existing and new competition.\nOur media businesses compete for audiences and advertising revenue with newspapers and other media such as the Internet, magazines, broadcast, cable and satellite television, radio, direct mail, outdoor billboards, and yellow pages. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. If we fail to compete effectively with competing newspapers and other media, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, our publications generate a significant portion of their advertising revenues from a few categories, including automotive and employment classified advertising. As a result, even in the absence of a recession or economic downturn, technological, industry, or other changes specifically affecting these advertising sources could reduce advertising revenues and materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Further, our print editions and digital platforms compete directly with well-established websites dedicated to classified advertising, particularly in the automotive, employment, real estate, and legal verticals. Our results may be negatively affected if we do not compete effectively online in the classified advertising market.\nEconomic conditions may adversely affect demand for print and digital advertising, which could lead to further revenue declines in our publishing segment.\nOur advertising revenues depend on the strength of the economy. Our revenues are sensitive to economic trends and uncertainties, as well as discretionary spending by advertisers both at the national level and in the local markets we serve. A decline in the financial or economic prospects of current or periodic advertisers could alter their spending priorities. Certain segments of the economy have been challenged in recent years, particularly in the brick and mortar retail sector, and total advertising revenues have declined as a result. Advertising revenues may worsen if advertisers reduce their budgets, shift their spending priorities, are forced to consolidate, or cease operations.\nRevenue from printing and distributing publications for third parties may be adversely affected by many of the same business and industry risks facing us.\nWe generate a portion of our revenue from printing and distributing third-party publications, and our relationships with these third parties are generally pursuant to short-term contracts. Those third parties may be negatively affected by the same macroeconomic and industry trends affecting our media business such as the sensitivity to perceived economic weakness of discretionary spending by advertisers and subscribers, circulation declines, shifts in consumer habits, and the increasing popularity of digital media. If the third-party publications are negatively affected by these trends, they may reduce the volume of publications they print or distribute through us, and as a result we may lose some, or all, of the associated revenue.\nThe market for newsprint supply continues to experience consolidation and rationalization in response to declining demand, which has resulted in significant volatility in the price of newsprint and challenges in obtaining newsprint from suppliers on a timely basis.\nOur publishing operations depend significantly upon the continuing availability of newsprint, and our publishing segment's results of operations are affected significantly by changes in newsprint prices. The supply of available newsprint continues to\ndecline as producers respond to declining demand by closing paper mills or converting them to packaging, other grades of paper or specialty products. The closure or conversion of a paper mill, in whole or part, can cause a sudden contraction in the availability of newsprint, leading to price volatility and unexpected challenges in obtaining newsprint on a timely basis. We import a significant portion of our newsprint from Canada. During the first half of 2018, anti-dumping and countervailing duties were imposed on Canadian manufacturers of newsprint, resulting in higher prices from our Canadian producers. These tariffs were rescinded in September 2018, but similar tariffs could be imposed in the future, further impacting the price of imported newsprint.\nIn addition, the price and availability of newsprint to us may be further impacted by:\n\u2022\nIncreases in supplier operating expenses due to rising raw material or energy costs or other factors;\n\u2022\nFurther reduction in the number of suppliers due to continuing consolidation of North American newsprint mills;\n\u2022\nChallenges in maintaining existing relationships with newsprint suppliers;\n\u2022\nIncreases in freight costs; and\n\u2022\nUnavailability of trucks or other means of transporting newsprint due to changes in trucking regulations and other factors.\nOur publishing segment\u2019s operating expenses may rise if newsprint prices increase significantly. In addition, if newsprint is undersupplied in the U.S. or U.K. for a protracted period or we experience significant supply chain disruptions, our business and operations may be materially and adversely affected. We may, among other actions, be forced to limit the length of certain publications or the frequency with which we print certain publications, which could adversely affect our reputation and advertiser or subscriber retention.\nOur business or results of operations could suffer if we fail to protect our publishing segment's intellectual property and other proprietary rights.\nOur publishing segment's ability to compete depends, in part, upon our intellectual property, including our trademarks (e.g., mastheads), copyrights (e.g., content), and proprietary technology (e.g., digital platforms). If we are unable to protect this intellectual property, we may not realize the full value of our intellectual property assets, and our business and results of operations may suffer. We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, patent, unfair competition, trade secret, and other laws to protect our intellectual property. However, these methods afford only limited protection and may not be adequate. For example, technological advancements have facilitated the unauthorized duplication and wide dissemination of content, making enforcement of our intellectual property rights in content more challenging. Litigation or proceedings in Federal court or before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Our efforts to enforce or protect our rights may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.\nIn addition, third parties might claim that the conduct of our businesses or use of intellectual property infringes upon their intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property litigation or claims brought against us, whether or not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, and we may not achieve favorable outcomes in all cases. The terms of any settlement or judgment may require us to pay substantial amounts to the other party or cease exercising our rights in the intellectual property. We might have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party's rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all.\nLabor strikes, lockouts and protracted negotiations could lead to business interruptions and increased operating costs, either for our businesses or for our suppliers.\nAs of December 31, 2018, union employees comprised approximately 14% of our workforce. We are required to negotiate collective bargaining agreements on an ongoing basis. If we, or our suppliers, are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, affected unions or others could implement strikes, lockouts, work stoppages, or other business interruptions. A significant labor dispute could materially adversely affect our operating revenues, cash flows, or operating income by, among other matters, disrupting our ability to provide customers with our products or services. In addition, even if labor negotiations are resolved successfully, they may lead to greater overall employee costs.\nRisks Relating to Our ReachLocal Segment\nWeak economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our digital marketing solutions, which may adversely affect business and operating results of our ReachLocal segment.\nThe revenues generated by our ReachLocal segment are sensitive to economic fluctuations. Many small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) have modest advertising budgets. To the extent economic conditions worsen, our existing and potential clients may no longer consider investment in our online marketing solutions a necessity or may elect to reduce advertising budgets. Historically, economic downturns have resulted in overall reductions in advertising spending. In particular, online marketing advertising solutions may be viewed by some of our existing and potential clients as a lower priority and may be among the first expenditures reduced as a result of unfavorable economic conditions. These developments could cause us to respond by temporarily reducing hiring or taking other measures and could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur ReachLocal segment's future revenues depend substantially on our ability to successfully develop and launch new products and services, acquire complimentary products and services, and market those products and services in our local markets.\nOur ReachLocal segment's ability to stay competitive and generate future revenue depends substantially on its successful development and launch of new products and services on a timely basis. We may be unable to develop new solutions due to employee turnover, failure to sustain the required level of investment in product and technology development, or difficulties of designing complex software products, achieving desired functionality, and integrating the new products with its existing technology. In addition, we intend to supplement our offerings through acquisitions of businesses offering complimentary products and services such as our acquisition of WordStream in 2018. We may be unsuccessful in integrating acquired products and services with our existing offerings or may be unable to devote sufficient resources to the further development of the acquired products and services.\nEven after developing or acquiring new solutions, we may be unable to launch them successfully. The sale of new or additional features, products and services, the value of which may be different from our current solutions or less easily understood by clients, may require increasingly sophisticated sales efforts as well as additional salesforce training and client education, any of which could increase operating expenses. Further, the future revenues of our ReachLocal segment depend substantially on our ability to market the entire LOCALiQ suite of products and solutions, including the publishing segment\u2019s print and display advertising and the ReachLocal segment\u2019s digital marketing services, to clients in our local markets. If we are unsuccessful in selling all of our products and services in our local markets, the ReachLocal segment\u2019s results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe market in which our ReachLocal segment operates is intensely competitive, which may adversely impact our margins. If we do not compete effectively, the segment\u2019s operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur ReachLocal segment operates in a highly competitive market. The market for online marketing solutions is rapidly changing and, with the emergence of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. Some of our competitors offer products similar to ours at a lower price, putting pressure on us to lower our prices (thereby reducing margins) or lose clients. Our digital marketing services competitors include online publishers, traditional media companies, local SMB marketing providers, SMB marketing technology providers, and new competitors that we may face as we launch new products or enter new markets. Many of our current and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, and substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources. If we fail to compete successfully against current and potential competitors, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur ReachLocal segment purchases most of its media from Google, and its business could be adversely affected if Google takes actions that are adverse to our interests or if we fail to meet advertiser or spend targets necessary for receiving rebates from Google. Similar actions from Yahoo!, Microsoft, and other media providers also could adversely affect the segment's business.\nMost of ReachLocal's cost of sales relates to the purchase of media, and a substantial majority of the media it purchases is from Google. In addition, a substantial portion of WordStream's revenue consists of rebates from Google for achieving certain advertiser or spend targets. Google accounts for a large majority of all U.S. searches, and Google's share in foreign markets is often even greater. As a result, we expect our ReachLocal segment will depend upon media purchases and rebates from Google for the foreseeable future. This dependence makes that business vulnerable to actions Google may take to change the manner in\nwhich it sells AdWords, provides rebates to us, or conducts its business. In addition, any new developments or rumors of developments regarding Google's business practices that affect the local online advertising industry may adversely affect our products or create perceptions with clients that our ability to compete in the online marketing industry has been impaired. These risks also apply to other publishers with whom we do business, including Yahoo! and Microsoft, though to a lesser degree.\nOur business or results of operations could suffer if we fail to protect our ReachLocal segment's intellectual property and other proprietary rights.\nOur ReachLocal segment's business is heavily dependent on intellectual property, including proprietary technology. As with our publishing segment, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, patent, unfair competition, trade secret, and other laws to protect our intellectual property. However, these methods afford only limited protection and may not be adequate. In addition, because our ReachLocal segment sells its solutions internationally, we may need to enforce our rights under the laws of countries that do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. As a result, despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our online marketing and reporting solutions, technology, software, and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Our efforts to enforce or protect our rights may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. In addition, as with our publishing segment, third parties might claim the conduct of our businesses or use of intellectual property infringes upon their intellectual property rights. Any such claims could result in substantial costs or diversion of resources and could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOther General Business Risks\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur success depends substantially upon the continuing contributions of our senior management team and other key employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and our senior management and other key employees possess knowledge of our business and industry that may be difficult to replace. Our loss of members of senior management or key employees or our failure to attract and retain highly-skilled personnel for key positions could materially adversely affect our business. We therefore will incur significant costs to retain our key employees and to recruit new employees in the future.\nIn December 2018, we announced our Chief Executive Officer intends to retire in 2019, and we have launched a succession process. We may incur significant costs and our businesses may experience disruption in the process of recruiting a new Chief Executive Officer and during the subsequent transition period.\nOur business, reputation, and results of operations could be negatively affected if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we become subject to significant data security breaches or other security threats or disruptions.\nOur information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently and effectively. We rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data, communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment, and other business processes. We also use third-party technology and systems for many operations including encryption and authentication, employee e-mail, domain name registration, content delivery to customers, and back-office support. Our information technology systems and any third-party systems on which we rely could fail to perform as anticipated or could be disrupted or damaged by natural disasters, fires, power outages, acts of terrorism, or other similar events. Any such failures or disruptions could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, late or missed publications, and loss of sales and customers, any of which could negatively affect our business or results of operations.\nIn addition, attempts to compromise information technology systems occur regularly across many industries and sectors, and the techniques used to perpetrate such compromises (e.g., viruses, worms, or other malware, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering, and employee malfeasance) are constantly changing. Maintaining the security of our systems is critically important both due to our reliance on those systems and because they store and process confidential subscriber, employee, and other sensitive personal data. Although we and our third-party service providers have implemented security measures and other controls designed to prevent breaches, these precautions might fail to defend against future cyber-attacks or prevent breaches or other disruptions to our systems or those of our third-party providers. Because cyber-attacks evolve quickly and often are not recognized until after they are launched, we may be unable to anticipate them or implement adequate measures to prevent a breach. A significant breach could result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nImproper disclosures of personal data or confidential information;\n\u2022\nExpenditures of significant resources to remedy the breach and defend against further attacks;\n\u2022\nDiversion of management's attention and resources; and\n\u2022\nLiability under laws that protect personal data.\nThe foregoing consequences could result in increased operating costs, loss of revenue, and harm to our reputation. Though we maintain cyber risk insurance, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of our systems.\nRecent and future strategic acquisitions, investments, and partnerships may expose us to a variety of risks that might disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur strategic plan involves strategic acquisitions of digital businesses as well as targeted acquisitions of high-quality publishing businesses that we believe offer strong synergies with our existing portfolio. Any such acquisitions may involve significant new risks that could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows such as:\n\u2022\nDistraction of management attention from our current business operations;\n\u2022\nStrain on our human resources;\n\u2022\nInsufficient new revenue to offset expenses;\n\u2022\nIntegration challenges arising from factors such as combining company cultures and facilities;\n\u2022\nFailure to achieve expected synergies or implement effective cost controls;\n\u2022\nInability to integrate acquired digital products, services, or technologies into our existing business's offerings;\n\u2022\nInability to retain key employees of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nApplicability of new regulatory or foreign law requirements; and\n\u2022\nLiabilities and other exposures not discovered in our due diligence process.\nWe could fail to execute effectively our acquisition strategy if we cannot identify suitable acquisition targets or obtain regulatory approvals required to complete or realize the anticipated benefits of potential acquisitions. In addition, in order to consummate acquisitions or other strategic transactions, we may need to obtain additional financing from banks or through public or private offerings of debt or equity securities, which financing might not be available on attractive terms or at all.\nOur strategic plan could also involve investments in or partnerships with other companies, which may involve risks such as:\n\u2022\nOur inability to control the operations of our investee or partner;\n\u2022\nOur investee or partner's failure to achieve its business or financial goals or otherwise successfully implement its business plan; or\n\u2022\nOur inability to monetize an investment due to transfer restrictions and our lack of control over the timing or process for any potential disposition of our equity interest.\nEach of the foregoing risks could decrease the benefits we realize from an investment or partnership. We may receive little or no return on these investments, and we may be required to record charges to earnings if the companies in which we have invested decrease in value.\nWe may be unsuccessful in managing or growing our international operations.\nNewsquest operates in the U.K., and ReachLocal has international sales operations in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Brazil as well as campaign support services in India. Revenue from Newsquest accounted for 12% of our publishing segment's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenue from international operations outside North America accounted for 18% of our ReachLocal segment's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our ability to manage these international operations successfully is subject to numerous risks inherent in foreign operations, including:\n\u2022\nChallenges or uncertainties arising from unexpected legal, political, or systemic events;\n\u2022\nDifficulties or delays in developing a network of clients in international markets;\n\u2022\nRestrictions on the ability of U.S. companies to do business in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nDifferent legal or regulatory requirements, including with respect to internet services, privacy and data protection, censorship, banking and money transmitting, and selling, which may limit or prevent the offering of our products in some jurisdictions or otherwise harm our business;\n\u2022\nInternational intellectual property laws that may be insufficient to protect our intellectual property or permit us to successfully defend our intellectual property in international lawsuits;\n\u2022\nDifferent employee/employer relationships and the existence of workers' councils and labor unions, which could make it more difficult to terminate underperforming salespeople;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in accounts receivable collection;\n\u2022\nCurrency fluctuations and price controls or other restrictions on foreign currency;\n\u2022\nPotential adverse tax consequences including difficulties in repatriating earnings generated abroad; and\n\u2022\nLack of infrastructure to adequately conduct electronic commerce transactions.\nAny of the foregoing factors could adversely impact our international operations, which could harm our overall business, operating results, and financial condition.\nForeign exchange variability could materially and adversely affect our consolidated operating results.\nOur financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars. Newsquest operates in the U.K., and its operations are conducted in foreign currency, primarily the British pound sterling. Continued weakness or further weakening in the British pound sterling to U.S. dollar exchange rate could further diminish Newsquest's contributions to our results of operations. In addition, our ReachLocal segment conducts operations in several foreign jurisdictions. If the value of currency in any of those jurisdictions weakens as compared with the U.S. dollar, our ReachLocal segment's operations in those jurisdictions similarly will contribute less to our results.\nThe U.K. vote to leave the European Union could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThere remains substantial uncertainty surrounding the U.K.\u2019s vote to leave the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d). Any impact of the Brexit vote depends on the terms of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, which was formally initiated in 2017 and could take several years to accomplish. Businesses will face significant uncertainty and potentially additional compliance costs as the details of the U.K.-European Union relationship are refined during the transition period, which could impact levels of investment and overall business activity in the U.K. As a result, the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union could result in an economic downturn in Newsquest\u2019s markets, which could depress the demand for our products and services.\nThe value of our existing goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired, depending upon future operating results.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $949.9 million as of December 31, 2018, representing approximately 38% of our total assets. As required under U.S. GAAP, we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other\nintangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable. Continued declines in print advertising and circulation revenues, coupled with the erosion of general economic, market, or business conditions could negatively affect our business and stock price, which may require us to record impairment charges to goodwill or other intangible assets when we perform such evaluations. Any such charges would adversely affect future reported results of operations and stockholders' equity but would not affect our cash flow.\nOur pension plans are underfunded, and we must use a portion of our cash flows to make required contributions.\nWe, along with our subsidiaries, sponsor various defined benefit retirement plans, including plans established under collective bargaining agreements. Our retirement plans include the Gannett Retirement Plan (GRP), the Gannett 2015 Supplemental Retirement Plan, the Newsquest Pension Scheme in the U.K., the Newspaper Guild of Detroit Pension Plan, and a supplemental retirement plan we assumed pursuant to our acquisition of JMG. Many of our retirement plans were underfunded as of December 31, 2018 by a total of $294.4 million on a U.S. GAAP basis. The excess of pension benefit obligations over assets is expected to give rise to required pension contributions over the next several years. Various factors, including future investment returns, interest rates, and potential pension legislative changes, may impact the timing and amount of future pension contributions. We have committed to make a contribution of $25.0 million to the GRP in 2019 and 2020, as well as a $15.0 million contribution in 2021. We expect to contribute approximately $30.5 million to the U.K. Pension Plans in 2019, $25.2 million in 2020, and $22.9 million in 2021. We also expect to make aggregate contributions of $29.6 million to our other underfunded plans in fiscal year 2019 as well as additional contributions thereafter. Our ability to make contribution payments will depend on our future cash flows, which are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory, and other factors beyond our control.\nAdverse results from litigation or governmental investigations or changes in the regulatory environment could force us to change our business practices, impede our efforts to transform our business, or negatively affect our operating results.\nFrom time to time, we are a party to litigation and regulatory, environmental, and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies. Adverse outcomes in lawsuits or investigations could result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition as well as our ability to conduct our businesses as they presently are conducted. In addition, new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could result in penalties for non-compliance or reduction in revenues and could limit our ability to transform our businesses in accordance with our strategic plan.\nA portion of our revenues is earned under an affiliation agreement with cars.com, which may be terminated or amended to provide for less favorable terms in the future.\nIn connection with our separation from our former parent, we entered into a modified affiliation agreement with cars.com, which at the time was an affiliate of our former parent. The agreement was intended to permit our local markets to continue to earn advertising revenues from cars.com for up to five years after the separation, although the agreement may be terminated earlier in certain circumstances, including if we fail to achieve specified performance standards. We may cease to earn revenues under this agreement, or the amount of such revenues may be materially reduced, if the agreement is terminated or not renewed at the end of its five-year term (or if it is renewed on less favorable terms), and we are unable to find a suitable substitute. In addition, to the extent the agreement contains exclusivity or non-compete provisions, including restrictions on our ability to use a competing service or to compete with our counterparty, it could limit our ability to maximize our performance in the provision of online automobile sales services.\nWe could incur significant liability if the separation were determined to be a taxable transaction.\nIn connection with the separation, our former parent received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the requirements for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code would be satisfied. The opinion relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations, and undertakings from our former parent and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings were incorrect or not satisfied, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Further, notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the IRS could determine upon audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings were incorrect or violated, if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of our company or our former parent after the separation. If the separation were determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our former parent and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, and we could incur significant liabilities.\nThe Internal Revenue Service may disallow all or part of a worthless stock loss and bad debt deduction.\nDuring 2017, we made an election to treat one of our ReachLocal international subsidiaries as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. This election resulted in worthless stock and bad debt deductions of $101.0 million, yielding a tax benefit of $32.0 million. These tax deductions are subject to audit and possible adjustment by the IRS, which could result in the reversal of all or part of the income tax benefit. To account for this uncertainty, a reserve of $11.0 million has been established to reduce the benefit to an estimated realizable value of $21.0 million. While we believe this represents our best estimate of the benefit to be realized upon final acceptance of our tax return, the IRS could reject or reduce the amount of tax benefit related to these deductions. If the IRS rejects or reduces the amount of this income tax benefit, we may have to pay additional cash income taxes, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We cannot guarantee what the ultimate outcome or amount of the benefit we receive, if any, will be.\nThe potential enactment of a Digital Services Tax in the U.K. may impact future results.\nOn October 29, 2018, Her Majesty\u2019s Treasury issued budget guidance describing the framework of a proposed Digital Services Tax (DST) in the United Kingdom. This tax would apply beginning in year 2020. The 2% DST would apply to gross revenue of specified digital business models deriving value from participation of their users. While the tax is intended to apply to search engines, social media platforms, and online marketplaces, it may be applied to online advertising when the users of our publications receive advertising based on their participation with the publication. If the DST is enacted, we may have to pay additional cash taxes which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to our Stock and our Debt Arrangements\nWe cannot guarantee the timing, declaration, amount, or payment of dividends on our common stock.\nThe timing, declaration, amount, and payment of future dividends to stockholders falls within the discretion of our Board of Directors. The Board's decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, any future debt service obligations, covenants under our existing or future debt agreements, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors the Board deems relevant. Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur debt agreements contain various covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our businesses, including our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. Subject to certain exceptions, these covenants restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nPermit certain liens on current or future assets;\n\u2022\nEnter into certain corporate transactions;\n\u2022\nIncur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nMake certain payments or declare certain dividends or distributions;\n\u2022\nDispose of certain property;\n\u2022\nPrepay or amend the terms of other indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nEnter into certain transactions with affiliates.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our convertible notes or to repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the notes.\nIn April 2018, we completed the sale of $201.3 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024. Holders of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, upon conversion of the notes, unless we elect to deliver solely\nshares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of notes surrendered therefor or notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority, or by agreements governing our future indebtedness.\nOur failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the notes or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under such indenture. A default under the indenture governing the notes or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under the agreements governing our other indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the notes is triggered, holders of notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, unless we elect (subject to certain limitations to our election) to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law may discourage a takeover of our company.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain certain provisions that may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in our management or control over us. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, collectively:\n\u2022\nAuthorize the issuance of preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nProvide that vacancies on our Board of Directors, including vacancies resulting from an enlargement of our Board, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022\nPlace limits on which stockholders may call special meetings of stockholders and limit the actions that may be taken at such stockholder-called special meetings;\n\u2022\nProhibit stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nEstablish advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for elections as directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of our stockholders.\nThese provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, even though a majority of stockholders may consider such proposal, if effected, desirable. Such provisions could also make it more difficult for third parties to remove and replace the members of our Board of Directors. Moreover, these provisions may inhibit increases in the trading price of our common stock that may result from takeover attempts or speculation.", "PERMNO": 15391, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "GCI.1"}
