RISK FACTORS\nThe risks described below and in other documents we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.\nECONOMIC AND STRATEGIC RISKS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition, and the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and financial condition in the future remains uncertain.\nBeginning in early 2020, extraordinary and wide-ranging actions have been taken by international, federal, state, and local public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19). These actions have included, and continue to include, quarantines, physical distancing, face coverings, restrictions on public gatherings and other health and safety protocols, stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, mandatory business closures, and other mandates that have substantially restricted individuals\u2019 daily activities and curtailed or ceased many businesses\u2019 normal operations.\nIn response to the pandemic and these actions, we began implementing changes in our business in March 2020 designed to protect the health and well-being of our employees and customers and to support appropriate physical distancing and other health and safety protocols. In late March 2020, we temporarily reduced store hours and closed our sales floors in our company-operated paint stores to the general public, requiring our customers to order product online or via phone and to access their products via curbside pickup or delivery. We implemented remote, alternate and flexible work arrangements where possible, including implementing split shifts at facilities and remote work options for non-essential on-site functions, enhanced cleaning and sanitation procedures, transitioned some of our facilities to manufacture hand sanitizer for use in our facilities and surrounding communities, implemented domestic and international travel restrictions, implemented return to work and visitor screening protocols, and postponed or canceled hosting or attending large events. We also enhanced certain employee benefits, such as tele-health, paid sick leave, family leave and voluntary leave of absence policies and programs. In May 2020, we began the process of reinstituting regular store hours and re-opening the sales floors in our stores with appropriate health and safety protocols, which resulted in all of our stores in the U.S. and Canada being fully re-opened. We also began the process of returning some of our employees who work in office environments to the office, although many employees continue to work remotely. The necessary and appropriate measures we have taken have resulted in additional costs, including for COVID-related leave and related healthcare costs in support of our employees and their families, and have adversely impacted our business and financial performance. We also face operational risks in connection with remote work arrangements, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks and increased vulnerability to damage or interruption resulting from, among other causes, cyber attacks, security breaches, phishing, malware, viruses, ransomware, power outages or system failures. As our response to the pandemic continues and evolves, we expect to incur additional costs and are likely to experience further adverse impacts to our business, each of which may be significant.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has surfaced in all regions around the world and has severely impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, all of which are expected to continue, and all of which have adversely affected, and are expected to continue to adversely affect, our business. We continue to experience occasional, temporary disruptions and closures of some of our facilities due to COVID-19. We also continue to see shifts in consumer behaviors and preferences, as well as impacts in the demand for some of our products. Since the first quarter of 2020, we have experienced an unprecedented surge in do-it-yourself (DIY) demand due to some of our customers spending more time at home and focusing on home improvement projects. As a result, our architectural business was quick to recover from the onset of the pandemic, while many of our industrial businesses are recovering at a slower pace as commercial and other industrial projects are delayed. While we expect demand levels to return to more normalized levels eventually, our ability to predict and meet any future changes in the demand for our products due to the pandemic remains uncertain. Although the raw materials used in the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our products are typically available from various sources in sufficient quantities, and although we have not experienced significant raw material shortages, delays or increased costs to date, COVID-19 may result in increased costs and unexpected shortages or delays in the delivery of some raw materials, each of which could be significant. We reduced spending in certain areas of our business, including through voluntary and involuntary leave programs and reductions in capital expenditures, temporarily suspending share repurchases and reducing discretionary spending, and we may need to take additional actions to reduce spending in the future.\nWhile we are closely monitoring the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business, the extent of the impact on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, and financial performance, as well as our ability to execute near-term and long-term business strategies and initiatives, will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments, which are highly uncertain and which we cannot predict or control, and some of which we are not currently aware, including, but not limited to:\n(a) the duration, severity and scope of the pandemic, including additional waves, increases and spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases in certain areas; (b) rapidly-changing governmental and public health directives to contain and combat the outbreak, including the duration, degree and effectiveness of directives, as well as the easing, removal and potential reinstitution of directives; (c) the further development, availability, effectiveness and distribution of treatments and vaccines for COVID-19; (d) the extent and duration of the pandemic\u2019s adverse and volatile effects on economic and social activity, consumer confidence, discretionary spending and preferences, labor and healthcare costs, and unemployment rates, any of which may reduce demand for some of our products and impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us; (e) our ability to sell, provide and meet the demand for our services and products, including as a result of potential reinstitution of temporarily-reduced store hours and sales floor closures in our stores and continued travel restrictions, mandatory business closures, and stay-at-home or similar orders; (f) any temporary reduction in our workforce, closures of our offices and facilities and our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations, including as a result of employees or their family members testing positive for COVID-19; (g) the ability of our customers and suppliers to continue their operations, which could affect our ability to sell, provide and meet the demand for our services and products and result in terminations of contracts, losses of revenue and adverse effects to our supply chain; and (h) any impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of weaker economic conditions. If the pandemic continues to create disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets, or further impacts our credit ratings, it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet our liquidity needs.\nGiven the inherent uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, we expect the pandemic will continue to create challenging operating environments and have an adverse impact on our business in the near term. If these conditions persist for a prolonged period, the COVID-19 pandemic, including any of the above factors and others that are currently unknown, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, or financial condition.\nAdverse changes in general business and economic conditions in the United States and worldwide may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.\nOur business is sensitive to global and regional business and economic conditions. Adverse changes in such conditions in the United States and worldwide, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, may reduce the demand for some of our products, adversely impact our ability to predict and meet any future changes in the demand for our products, and impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us, each of which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition. Higher inflation rates, interest rates, tax rates and unemployment rates, higher labor and healthcare costs, recessions, changing governmental policies, laws and regulations, business disruptions due to cybersecurity incidents, terrorist activity, armed conflict, war, public health crises (including the COVID-19 pandemic), impacts of climate change, fires or other natural disasters, and other economic factors could also adversely affect demand for some of our products, our ability to predict and meet any future changes in the demand for our products, the availability, delivery or cost of raw materials, our ability to adequately staff and maintain operations at affected facilities and our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition and that of our customers, vendors and suppliers.\nProtracted duration of economic downturns in cyclical segments of the economy may depress the demand for some of our products and adversely affect our sales, earnings, cash flow or financial condition.\nPortions of our business involve the sale of paint, coatings and related products to segments of the economy that are cyclical in nature, particularly segments relating to construction, housing, manufacturing and oil production, refining, storage and transportation. Our sales to these segments are affected by the levels of discretionary consumer and business spending in these segments. During economic downturns in these segments, the levels of consumer and business discretionary spending may decrease, and the recovery of these segments may lag behind the recovery of the overall economy. This decrease in spending will likely reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely affect our sales, earnings, cash flow or financial condition.\nAlthough interest rates remain low by historical standards, any increase may adversely affect the demand for new residential homes, existing home turnover and new non-residential construction. A worsening in these segments will reduce the demand for some of our products and may adversely impact sales, earnings and cash flow.\nIn the U.S. construction and housing segments, the recent demand for new construction has caused contractors to experience a shortage of skilled workers, resulting in project backlogs and an adverse effect on the growth rate of demand for our products. While we expect to see higher demand for our products as project backlogs are reduced in the future, this labor shortage may adversely impact our sales, earnings, cash flow or financial condition.\nAdverse weather conditions or impacts of climate change and natural disasters may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and could have a negative effect on our sales, earnings or cash flow.\nOur business is seasonal in nature, with the second and third quarters typically generating a higher proportion of sales and earnings than other quarters. From time to time, adverse weather conditions or impacts of climate change and natural disasters have had or may have an adverse effect on our sales of paint, coatings and related products. Unusually cold and rainy weather could also have an adverse effect on sales of our exterior paint products. An adverse effect on sales may cause a reduction in our earnings or cash flow.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nA weakening of global credit markets may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.\nA weakening of global credit markets may adversely impact our net sales, the collection of accounts receivable, funding for working capital needs, expected cash flow generation from current and acquired businesses, access to capital and our investments, which may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.\nWe finance a portion of our sales through trade credit. Credit markets remain tight, and some customers who require financing for their businesses have not been able to obtain necessary financing. A continuation or worsening of these conditions could limit our ability to collect our accounts receivable, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.\nWe generally fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and obtain funding for other general corporate purposes through short-term borrowings backed by our revolving credit facility and other financing facilities. If any of the banks in these credit and financing facilities are unable to perform on their commitments, such inability could adversely impact our cash flow, liquidity or financial condition, including our ability to obtain funding for working capital needs and other general corporate purposes.\nAlthough we currently have available credit facilities to fund our current operating needs, we cannot be certain we will be able to replace our existing credit facilities or refinance our existing or future debt when necessary. Our cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions, but also by our debt and credit ratings assigned by the major credit rating agencies. Downgrades in these ratings, including due to uncertainties regarding COVID-19, will increase our cost of borrowing and could have an adverse effect on our access to the capital markets, including our access to the commercial paper market. An inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.\nWe have goodwill and intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such value may not be recoverable. An impairment assessment involves judgment as to assumptions regarding future sales and cash flow and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions and change our estimates of future sales and cash flow, resulting in us incurring substantial impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe hold investments in equity and debt securities in some of our defined benefit pension plans. A decrease in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn may cause a negative pension plan investment performance, which may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.\nWe require a significant amount of cash to service the substantial amount of debt we have outstanding. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. We also depend on the business of our subsidiaries to satisfy our cash needs. If we cannot generate the required cash, we may not be able to make the necessary payments required under our indebtedness.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had total debt of approximately $8.292 billion, which is a decrease of $393.1 million since December 31, 2019. We have the ability under our existing credit facilities to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to make payments on our debt, fund our other liquidity needs, and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our historical financial results have been, and we anticipate our future financial results will be, subject to fluctuations. Our ability to generate cash, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control, including public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and related impacts. We cannot guarantee our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt, fund other liquidity needs and make planned capital expenditures.\nThe degree to which we are currently leveraged could have important consequences for shareholders. For example, it could:\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business; or\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt.\nAdditionally, any failure to comply with covenants in the instruments governing our debt could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, would have a material adverse effect on us.\nA significant portion of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to generate sufficient cash flow for our needs is dependent to some extent on the earnings of our subsidiaries and the payment of those earnings to us in the form of dividends, loans or advances and through repayment of loans or advances from us. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities. Our subsidiaries have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt or to provide us with funds to meet our cash flow needs, whether in the form of dividends, distributions, loans or other payments. Further, any payment of dividends, loans or advances by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions. Payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings and business considerations. Our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors, including trade creditors. Even if we are a creditor of any of our subsidiaries, our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us. Finally, changes in the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may adversely affect the ability of some of our foreign subsidiaries to repatriate funds to us.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.\nBecause of our international operations, we are exposed to risk associated with interest rates and value changes in foreign currencies, which may adversely affect our business. Historically, our reported net sales, earnings, cash flow and financial condition have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our primary exchange rate exposure is with the Euro, the Chinese yuan, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, the British pound, the Mexican peso, the Australian dollar and the Argentine peso, each against the U.S. dollar. While we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy, we believe we may experience losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and such losses could adversely affect our sales, earnings, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nUnexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy may adversely affect our earnings or cash flow.\nWe purchase raw materials (including titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources, such as propylene and ethylene) and energy for use in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products. Factors such as political instability, higher tariffs, impacts of climate change and adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes and other natural disasters, or public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could disrupt the availability of raw material and fuel supplies, adversely impact our ability to adequately staff and maintain operations at affected facilities and increase our costs. In addition, environmental and social regulations, including regulations related to climate change, may negatively impact us or our suppliers in terms of availability and cost of raw materials, as well as sources and supply of energy. Although raw materials and energy supplies (including oil and natural gas) are generally available from various sources in sufficient quantities, unexpected shortages and increases in the cost of raw materials and energy, or any deterioration in our relationships with or the financial viability of our suppliers, may have an adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow in the event we are unable to obtain these raw materials and energy from other sources or offset higher costs in a timely manner by sufficiently decreasing our operating costs or raising the prices of our products. In recent years, some raw material and energy prices have increased, particularly titanium dioxide and petrochemical feedstock sources, such as propylene and ethylene, as well as metal and plastic packaging. The cost of raw materials and energy has in the past experienced, and likely will in the future continue to experience, periods of volatility.\nAlthough we have an extensive customer base, the loss of any of our largest customers could adversely affect our sales, earnings or cash flow.\nWe have a large and varied customer base due to our extensive distribution platform. During 2020, no individual customer accounted for sales totaling more than ten percent of our sales. However, we have some customers that, individually, purchase a large amount of products from us. Although our broad distribution channels help to minimize the impact of the loss of any one customer, the loss of any of these large customers could have an adverse effect on our sales, earnings or cash flow.\nIncreased competition or failure to keep pace with developments in key competitive areas of our business may reduce our sales, earnings or cash flow performance.\nWe face substantial competition from many international, national, regional and local competitors of various sizes in the manufacture, distribution and sale of our paint, coatings and related products. Some of our competitors are larger than us or operate more extensively in certain regions around the world and have greater financial or operational resources to compete. Other competitors are smaller and may be able to offer more specialized products. Technology, product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, distribution, service and price are key competitive factors for our business. Competition in any of these areas, or failure to keep pace with developments in any of these areas, may reduce our sales and adversely affect our earnings or cash flow by resulting in decreased sales volumes, reduced prices and increased costs of manufacturing, distributing and selling our products.\nOur results of operations, cash flow or financial condition may be negatively impacted if we do not successfully integrate future acquisitions into our existing operations and if the performance of the businesses we acquire do not meet our expectations.\nWe have historically made strategic acquisitions of businesses in the paint and coatings industry and will likely acquire additional businesses in the future as part of our long-term growth strategy. The success of future acquisitions depends in large part on our ability to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired companies and manage challenges that may arise as a result of the acquisitions, particularly when the acquired businesses operate in new or foreign markets. In the event we do not successfully integrate such future acquisitions into our existing operations so as to realize the expected return on our investment, our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks and uncertainties associated with our expansion into and our operations in Asia, Europe, South America and other foreign markets could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.\nNet external sales of our consolidated foreign subsidiaries totaled approximately 19.5%, 20.6% and 23.0% of our total consolidated net sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Sales outside of the United States make up a significant part of our current business and future strategic plans. Our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition could be adversely affected by a variety of domestic and international factors, including general economic conditions, political instability, inflation rates, recessions, tariffs, foreign currency exchange rates, foreign currency exchange controls, interest rates, foreign investment and repatriation restrictions, legal and regulatory constraints, civil unrest, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations and other external economic and political factors. In addition, public health crises (including the COVID-19 pandemic) in foreign jurisdictions may temporarily reduce the demand for some of our products and adversely affect the availability and cost of raw materials. Our inability to successfully manage the risks and uncertainties relating to any of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition.\nIn many foreign countries, it is acceptable to engage in certain business practices we are prohibited from engaging in because of regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both U.S. and non-U.S. regulators, and an increase in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. Although we have internal control policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these regulations, there can be no assurance our policies and procedures will prevent a violation of these regulations. Any violation could cause an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.\nPolicy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment may affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. Our business benefits from free trade agreements, which may include the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and efforts to withdraw from, or substantially modify such agreements, in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs, import or export licensing requirements, exchange controls or new barriers to entry, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flow and that of our customers, vendors and suppliers.\nAdditionally, the results of the United Kingdom\u2019s referendum on European Union membership, which resulted in the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union on January 31, 2020 (\u201cBrexit\u201d), caused significant volatility in global stock markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty. The transition period post-Brexit expired on December 31, 2020, and the United Kingdom and European Union entered into a free trade agreement that now governs the United Kingdom\u2019s relationship with the European Union. While the United Kingdom and European Union can generally continue to trade with each other without the imposition of tariffs for imports and exports, there are new customs requirements that require additional documentation and data, and there are also new controls on the movement and reporting of goods (including\nchemicals). We do not know the extent to which Brexit and the free trade agreement will ultimately impact the business and regulatory environment in the United Kingdom, the rest of the European Union or other countries, although it is possible there will be tighter controls and administrative requirements for imports and exports between the United Kingdom and the European Union or other countries, as well as increased regulatory complexities. Any of these factors could adversely impact customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our results of operations.\nCybersecurity incidents and other disruptions to our information technology systems could interfere with our operations, result in the compromise or loss of critical and confidential information and severely harm our business.\nWe rely on information technology systems to conduct our business, including recording and processing transactions, manufacturing and selling our products, maintaining and growing our competitive position, and supporting and communicating with our employees, customers, suppliers and other vendors. These information technology systems are important to many business-critical processes including, but not limited to, production planning, manufacturing, finance, company operations, sales and customer service. Some of these systems are maintained or operated by third party providers. Despite our efforts to prevent disruptions to these information technology systems, these systems may be affected by damage or interruption resulting from, among other causes, cyber attacks, security breaches, phishing, malware, viruses, ransomware, power outages or system failures. These risks could be magnified due to the increased reliance on information technology systems because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Disruptions to these systems may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs part of our business, we collect and handle sensitive and confidential information about our business, customers, employees and suppliers. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those third-parties with which we do business, may be vulnerable to cyber attacks, security breaches, malware, viruses, ransomware, power outages, system failures, acts of vandalism or misconduct, human or technical errors or other similar events or disruptions. Any such event involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of information, whether impacting us or third-parties with which we do business, could result in losses, damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of litigation, regulatory action and liability, disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We continue to mitigate these risks in a number of ways, including through additional investment, engagement of third-party experts and consultants, improving the security of our facilities and systems, providing training for employees, assessing the continued appropriateness of relevant insurance coverage and strengthening our controls to monitor and mitigate these threats.\nThe domestic and international regulatory environment related to information security, collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous and complex, with new and rapidly changing requirements applicable to our business. Compliance with these requirements, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act and other international and domestic regulations, could result in additional costs and changes to our business practices.\nInability to protect or enforce our material trademarks and other intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe have numerous patents, trade secrets, trademarks, trade names and know-how that are valuable to our business. Despite our efforts to protect such intellectual property and other proprietary information from unauthorized use or disclosure, third parties may attempt to disclose, obtain or use our trademarks or such other intellectual property and information without our authorization. Although we rely on the patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws of the United States and other countries to protect our intellectual property rights, the laws of some countries may not protect such rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property by third parties, the failure of foreign countries to have laws to protect our intellectual property rights, or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could have an adverse effect on our business.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nWe are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws, rules and regulations, for which compliance could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of complex domestic and foreign laws, rules and regulations, and legal compliance risks, including securities laws, tax laws, employment and pension-related laws, competition laws, U.S. and foreign export and trading laws, data privacy and security laws, and laws governing improper business practices. We are affected by new laws and regulations, and changes to existing laws and regulations, including interpretations by courts and regulators. From time to time, our Company, our operations and the industries in which we operate are being reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions or the assertion of private litigation claims and damages.\nAlthough we believe we have adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to mitigate these risks, the global and diverse nature of our operations means compliance risks will continue to exist. Investigations, examinations and other proceedings, the nature and outcome of which cannot be predicted, will likely arise from time to time. These investigations,\nexaminations and other proceedings could subject us to significant liability and require us to take significant accruals or pay significant settlements, fines and penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.\nWe are subject to tax laws and regulations in the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions. We are affected by changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes in related interpretations and other tax guidance. In the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to examinations and investigations by various tax authorities and other regulators. In addition to existing examinations and investigations, there could be additional examinations and investigations in the future, and existing examinations and investigations could be expanded.\nFor non-income tax risks, we estimate material loss contingencies and accrue for such loss contingencies as required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency. In the event the loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued, the recording of the additional liability may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued. In those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable a liability has been incurred and cannot be reasonably estimated, any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid. For income tax risks, we recognize tax benefits based on our assessment that a tax benefit has a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant facts. For those income tax positions where we determine there is not a greater than 50% likelihood such tax benefits will be sustained, we do not recognize a tax benefit in our financial statements. Subsequent events may cause us to change our assessment of the likelihood of sustaining a previously-recognized benefit which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow or financial position for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued or paid.\nWe discuss risks and uncertainties with regard to taxes in more detail in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nWe are required to comply with numerous complex and increasingly stringent domestic and foreign health, safety and environmental laws, regulations and requirements, the cost of which is likely to increase and may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to various domestic and foreign health, safety and environmental laws, regulations and requirements, including related to climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. These laws, regulations and requirements not only govern our current operations and products, but also impose potential liability on us for our past operations. We expect health, safety and environmental laws, regulations and requirements to be increasingly stringent upon our industry and us in the future. Our costs to comply with these laws, regulations and requirements may increase as they become more stringent in the future, and these increased costs may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow or financial condition.\nWe are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites, as well as a number of third-party sites, for which our ultimate liability may exceed the current amount we have accrued.\nWe are involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of our currently and formerly owned sites and a number of third-party sites. We accrue for estimated costs of investigation and remediation activities at these sites for which commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment. These estimated costs are based on currently available facts regarding each site. We continuously assess our potential liability for investigation and remediation activities and adjust our environmental-related accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated. Due to the uncertainties surrounding environmental investigation and remediation activities, our liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued and may have an adverse effect on our earnings. We discuss these risks and uncertainties in more detail in the \u201cEnvironmental Matters\u201d and \u201cEnvironmental-Related Liabilities\u201d sections in Item 7 and in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nThe nature, cost, quantity and outcome of pending and future litigation, such as litigation arising from the historical manufacture and sale of lead pigments and lead-based paint, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and financial condition.\nIn the course of our business, we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits, including, but not limited to, litigation relating to product liability and warranty, personal injury, environmental (including natural resource damages), intellectual property,\ncommercial, contractual and antitrust claims that are inherently subject to many uncertainties regarding the possibility of a loss to us. These uncertainties will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur confirming the incurrence of a liability or the reduction of a liability. In accordance with the Contingencies Topic of the ASC, we accrue for these contingencies by a charge to income when it is both probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In the event a loss contingency is ultimately determined to be significantly higher than currently accrued, the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such additional liability is accrued. In those cases where no accrual is recorded because it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of any such loss cannot be reasonably estimated, any potential liability ultimately determined to be attributable to us may result in a material impact on our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition for the annual or interim period during which such liability is accrued.\nOur past operations included the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and lead-based paints. Along with other companies, we are and have been a defendant in a number of legal proceedings, including individual personal injury actions, purported class actions and actions brought by various counties, cities, school districts and other government-related entities, arising from the manufacture and sale of lead pigments and lead-based paints. The plaintiffs\u2019 claims have been based upon various legal theories, including negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty, negligent misrepresentations and omissions, fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions, concert of action, civil conspiracy, violations of unfair trade practice and consumer protection laws, enterprise liability, market share liability, public nuisance, unjust enrichment and other theories. The plaintiffs seek various damages and relief, including personal injury and property damage, costs relating to the detection and abatement of lead-based paint from buildings, costs associated with a public education campaign, medical monitoring costs and others. We have also been a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the manufacture and sale of non-lead-based paints that seek recovery based upon various legal theories, including the failure to adequately warn of potential exposure to lead during surface preparation when using non-lead-based paint on surfaces previously painted with lead-based paint. We believe the litigation brought to date is without merit or subject to meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending such litigation. We expect additional lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation may be filed against us in the future asserting similar or different legal theories and seeking similar or different types of damages and relief. The Company will continue to vigorously defend against any additional lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation that may be filed, including utilizing all avenues of appeal, if necessary.\nNotwithstanding our views on the merits, litigation is inherently subject to many uncertainties, and we ultimately may not prevail. Adverse court rulings or determinations of liability, among other factors, could affect the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation against us and encourage an increase in the number and nature of future claims and proceedings. From time to time, various legislation and administrative regulations have been enacted, promulgated or proposed to impose obligations on present and former manufacturers of lead pigments and lead-based paints respecting asserted health concerns associated with such products or to overturn the effect of court decisions in which we and other manufacturers have been successful.\nDue to the uncertainties involved, management is unable to predict the outcome of the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation, the number or nature of possible future claims and proceedings, or the effect any legislation and/or administrative regulations may have on the litigation or against us. Further, management cannot reasonably determine the scope or amount of the potential costs and liabilities related to such litigation, or resulting from any such legislation and regulations. Except with respect to the California public nuisance litigation, we have not accrued any amounts for such litigation because we do not believe it is probable that a loss has occurred, and we believe it is not possible to estimate the range of potential losses as there is no substantive information upon which an estimate could be based. Any potential liability that may result from any changes to legislation and regulations cannot reasonably be estimated. Due to the uncertainties associated with the amount of any such liability and/or the nature of any other remedy which may be imposed in such litigation, any potential liability determined to be attributable to us arising out of such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity or financial condition. We discuss the risks and uncertainties related to litigation, including the lead pigment and lead-based paint litigation, in more detail in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.", "PERMNO": 36468, "SIC": 2851, "TIC": "SHW"}
