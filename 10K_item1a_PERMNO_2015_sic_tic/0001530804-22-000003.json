{"cik": "1530804", "company": "Tronox Holdings plc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those we currently view to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The following risk factors are not necessarily presented in order of relative importance and should not be considered to represent a complete set of all potential risks that could affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nMarket conditions, as well as global and regional economic downturns that adversely affect the demand for our end-use products, could adversely affect the results of our operations and the prices at which we can sell our products, thus, negatively impacting our financial results.\nOur revenue and results of operations are significantly dependent on sales of TiO2 products and zircon. Demand for these products historically have been linked to global, regional and local GDP and discretionary spending, which can be negatively impacted by regional and world events or economic and market conditions. Such events can cause a decrease in demand for our products and market prices to fall, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities that reprice as market supply and demand fundamentals change. Accordingly, product margins and the results of operations tend to vary with changes in the business cycle.\nA significant portion of the demand for our TiO2 products comes from manufacturers of paint and plastics. A significant portion of the demand for zircon comes from the construction and other industrial end markets. Our customers may experience significant fluctuations in demand for their own end products because of economic conditions, changes in consumer demand, or increases in raw material and energy costs. In addition, with respect to the zircon market, we believe that China currently accounts for approximately 50% of the world\u2019s demand for zircon. As such, any prolonged downturn in China could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nThe price of our products, in particular, TiO2, zircon, and pig iron, have been, and in the future may be, volatile. Price declines for our products will negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.\nHistorically, the global market for TiO2, zircon and pig iron have been volatile, and those markets are likely to remain volatile in the future. Prices for TiO2, zircon and pig iron may fluctuate in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of, and demand for, these products, market uncertainty and other factors beyond our control. Factors that affect the price of our products include, among other things:\n\u2022overall economic conditions;\n\u2022the level of customer demand particularly in the paint, plastics and construction industries;\n\u2022the level of production and exports of our products globally, including the impact of competitors increasing their capacity and exports;\n\u2022the level of production and cost of materials, such as chlorine, sulfuric acid and anthracite, used to produce our products, including rising prices of raw materials due to inflation;\n\u2022the cost of energy consumed in the production of TiO2 and zircon, including the price of natural gas, electricity and pet coke;\n\u2022domestic and foreign governmental relations, tariffs or other trade disputes, regulations and taxes; and\n\u2022political conditions or hostilities and unrest in regions where we export our TiO2, zircon and feedstock/other products.\nPricing pressure with respect to our TiO2 products, zircon and pig iron can make it difficult to predict the cash we may have on hand at any given time, and a prolonged period of price declines may materially and adversely affect our financial position, liquidity, ability to finance planned capital expenditures and results of operations.\nThe ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, including new strains of the virus, has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have significant sales and manufacturing operations in the U.S., Europe, South Africa, Brazil, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Australia, and each of these countries has been significantly affected by the outbreak and taken measures to try to contain it. These restrictive measures have adversely impacted, and may further adversely impact, our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers. Demand for our products could decrease as a result of the pandemic. Any such future developments are dependent upon factors including, but are not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, the severity of new strains of the virus, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, the effectiveness of treatments and vaccines, the size and effectiveness of the compensating measures taken by governments, including the failure to implement additional stimuli and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. It is possible that the continued spread of COVID-19, including new strains of the virus, will cause an additional economic slowdown, and it is possible that this could cause a global recession. Such adverse impact on the global economy is likely to adversely affect our performance, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our ability to successfully execute our business strategies and initiatives, such as the funding of capital expenditures, including by negatively impacting the demand for our products and services, negatively affecting the parties with whom we do business and disrupting our ability to conduct product development and other important business activities.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect the global economy, and/or adversely affects our business, operations or financial performance, it may also have the effect of increasing the likelihood and/or magnitude of other risks described in this section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d. We are closely monitoring the potential adverse effects and impact on our operations, businesses and financial performance, including liquidity and capital usage, though the extent is difficult to fully predict at this time due to the rapid evolution of this uncertain situation.\nOur industry and the end-use markets in which we compete are highly competitive. This competition may adversely affect our results of operations and operating cash flows.\nEach of our markets is highly competitive. Competition in the TiO2 industry is based on a number of factors such as price, product quality, and service. We face significant competition from major international and smaller regional competitors, including producers in China. Moreover, Chinese producers have significantly expanded their production capacity in recent years and have also commenced the commercial production of TiO2 via chloride technology. The risk of substitution of these Chinese producers by our customers could increase as these Chinese producers expand their use of chloride technology, improve the quality of their chloride technology, and continue to improve the quality of their sulfate products. Moreover, we compete with a large number of mining companies with respect to zircon. Zircon producers generally compete on the basis of price, quality, logistics, delivery, and payment terms and consistency of supply.\nWithin the end-use markets in which we compete, competition between products is intense. We face substantial risk that our customers could switch to our competitors\u2019 products in response to any number of developments including lower price offerings by our competitors for substantially the same products, new product development by competitors, increased commercial production of TiO2 via chloride technology by Chinese producers, greater acceptance of TiO2 produced via sulfate technology in end-market applications previously characterized by TiO2 produced via chloride technology, or with respect to zircon customers, switching to lower priced substitute products. Our inability to develop, produce or market our products to compete effectively against our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nAn increase in the price of energy or other raw materials, or an interruption in our energy or other raw material supply, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur mining, beneficiation, smelting and production processes consume significant amounts of energy and raw materials, the costs of which can be subject to worldwide, as well as, local supply and demand, as well as other factors beyond our control. Fuel and energy linked to commodities, such as diesel, natural gas, heavy fuel oil and pet coke, and other consumables, such as chlorine, sulfuric acid, illuminating paraffin, electrodes, sulfur and anthracite, consumed in our TiO2 manufacturing and mining operations form an important part of our TiO2 operating costs. We have no control over the costs of these consumables, many of which are linked to some degree to the price of oil, and the costs of many of these raw materials may fluctuate widely for a variety of reasons, including changes in availability, major capacity additions or reductions, or significant facility operating problems. Availability of such consumables could also be impacted by transportation capacity constraints or other interruptions. These fluctuations could negatively affect our operating margins, our results of operations or planned capital expenditures. As these costs rise, our operating expenses will increase and could adversely affect our business, especially if we are unable to pass price increases in raw materials through to our customers.\nThe markets for many of our products have seasonally affected sales patterns.\nHistorically, the demand for our products is subject to seasonal fluctuations. TiO2 is widely used in paint and other coatings where demand increases prior to the painting season in the Northern Hemisphere (spring and summer). Additionally, although zircon is generally a non-seasonal product, it is negatively impacted by the winter and Chinese New Year celebrations due to reduced zircon demand from China. We may be adversely affected by existing or future cyclical changes, and such conditions may be sustained or further aggravated by anticipated or unanticipated changes in regional weather conditions. For example, poor weather conditions in a region can lead to an abbreviated painting season, which can depress consumer sales of paint products that use TiO2.\nWe are dependent on, and compete with other mining and chemical businesses for, key human resources in the countries in which we operate, and our business will suffer if we are unable to hire or deploy highly skilled employees.\nWe compete with other chemical and mining companies, and other companies generally, in the countries in which we operate to attract and retain key human resources at all levels with the appropriate technical skills and operating and managerial experience necessary to continue operating and expanding our businesses. These operations use modern techniques and equipment and accordingly require various types of skilled workers. The success of our business will be materially dependent upon the skills, experience and efforts of our key officers and skilled employees. Competition for skilled employees may cost us in terms of higher labor costs or reduced productivity. In addition, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, certain countries in which we operate have imposed stringent travel and immigration restrictions which may further hinder our ability to deploy necessary human resources. As a result, we may not be able to attract, retain and deploy skilled and experienced employees.\nShould we lose any of our key personnel or fail to attract, retain and deploy key qualified personnel or other skilled employees, our business may be harmed and our operational results and financial condition could be affected.\nIf we are unable to innovate and successfully introduce new products, or new technologies or processes reduce the demand for our products or the price at which we can sell products, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur industries and the end-use markets into which we sell our products experience periodic technological change and product improvement. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to gauge the direction of commercial and technological progress in key end-use markets or if we fail to fund and successfully develop, manufacture and market products in such changing end-use markets.\nIn addition, new technologies or processes have the potential to replace or provide lower-cost alternatives to our products, such as new processes that reduce the amount of TiO2 or zircon content in consumer products which in turn could depress the demand and pricing for TiO2 or zircon, respectively. We cannot predict whether technological innovations will, in the future, result in a lower demand for our products or affect the competitiveness of our business. We may be required to invest significant resources to adapt to changing technologies, markets and competitive environments.\nGiven the nature of our chemical, mining and smelting operations, we face a material risk of liability, production delays and additional expenditures from environmental and industrial accidents.\nOur business is exposed to, among other things, environmental hazards and industrial accidents the occurrence of which could delay production, suspend operations, increase repair, maintenance or medical costs and, due to the vertical integration of our operations, could have an adverse effect on the productivity and results of operations of a particular manufacturing facility or on our business as a whole. Furthermore, during operational breakdowns resulting from any such environmental hazard or industrial accident, the relevant facility may not be restored to full operations within the anticipated timeframe, which could result in further business losses. Over our operating history, we have incurred incidents of this nature. If any of the equipment on which we depend were severely damaged or were destroyed by fire, flooding, or otherwise, we may be unable to replace or repair it in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost, which would impact our ability to produce and ship our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEquipment failures and deterioration of assets may lead to production curtailments, shutdowns or additional expenditures.\nOur operations depend upon critical equipment that must periodically maintained and upgraded in order to avoid suffering unanticipated breakdowns or failures. As a result, our mining operations and processing plants may be interrupted or curtailed by equipment failures, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, assets critical to our mining and chemical processing operations may deteriorate due to wear and tear or otherwise sooner than we currently estimate. Such deterioration may result in additional maintenance spending and additional capital expenditures. If these assets do not generate the amount of future cash flows that we expect, and we are not able to refurbish them or procure replacement assets in an economically feasible manner, our future results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be seriously impacted by security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents.\nWe rely on information technology systems across our operations to manage our accounting, finance, and supply chain functions. Our information technology is provided by a combination of internal and external services and service providers. Further, our business involves the use, processing, storage and transmission of information about customers, suppliers and employees using such information technology systems. Our ability to effectively operate our business depends on the security, reliability and capacity of these systems.\nLike most major corporations, we may become the target of cyberattacks, including industrial espionage, phishing or ransomware attacks, from time to time. For instance, the Cristal business we acquired in April 2019 was subject to a significant cybersecurity attack in 2017. Failure to effectively prevent, detect and recover from security breaches, including attacks on information technology and infrastructure by hackers; viruses; breaches due to employee error or actions; or other disruptions could seriously harm our operations as well as the operations of our customers and suppliers. Such serious harm can involve, among other things, misuse of our assets, business disruptions, loss of data, unauthorized access to trade secrets and confidential business information, unauthorized access to personal information, legal claims or proceedings, reporting errors, processing inefficiencies, negative media attention, reputational harm, loss of sales, remediation and increased insurance costs, and interference with regulatory compliance. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of cybersecurity threats and incidents, which may be material.\nWe have put in place training and security measures designed to protect against cyberattacks, phishing, security breaches and misappropriation or corruption of our systems, intentional or unintentional disclosure of confidential information, or disruption of our operations. As these threats continue to evolve, particularly around cybersecurity, we may be required to expend significant resources to enhance our control environment, processes, practices and other protective measures. Despite these efforts, we may not be able to prevent cyberattacks and other security breaches and such events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ore resources and reserve estimates are based on a number of assumptions, including mining and recovery factors, future cash costs of production and ore demand and pricing. As a result, ore resources and reserve quantities actually produced may differ from current estimates.\nThe mineral resource and reserve estimates are estimates of the quantity and ore grades in our mines based on the interpretation of geological data obtained from drill holes and other sampling techniques, as well as from feasibility studies. The accuracy of these estimates is dependent on the assumptions and judgments made in interpreting the geological data in accordance with established guidelines and standards. Our mineral reserves represent the amount of ore that we believe can be economically mined and processed, and are estimated based on a number of factors.\nThere is significant uncertainty in any mineral reserve or mineral resource estimate. Factors that are beyond our control, such as the ability to secure mineral rights, the sufficiency of mineralization to support mining and beneficiation practices and the suitability of the market may significantly impact mineral resource and reserve estimates. The actual deposits encountered and the economic viability of mining a deposit may differ materially from our estimates. Since these mineral resources and reserves are estimates based on assumptions, we may revise these estimates in the future as we become aware of new developments. To maintain TiO2 feedstock and zircon production beyond the expected lives of our existing mines or to increase production materially above projected levels, we will need to access additional reserves through exploration or discovery.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE GLOBAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS\nWe are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.\nWe have operations in jurisdictions around the globe which subjects us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022adapting to unfamiliar regional and geopolitical conditions and demands, including political instability, civil unrest, expropriation, nationalization of properties by a government, imposition of sanctions, changes to import or export regulations and fees, renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements, mining leases and permits;\n\u2022increased difficulties with regard to political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;\n\u2022economic and commercial instability risks, including those caused by sovereign and private debt default, corruption, and new and unfamiliar laws and regulations at national, regional and local levels, including taxation regimes, tariffs and trade barriers, exchange controls, repatriation of earnings, and labor and environmental and health and safety laws and regulations;\n\u2022implementation of additional technological and cybersecurity measures and cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities;\n\u2022major public health issues, including the current COVID-19 pandemic, which could cause, and have caused, disruptions in our operations or workforce;\n\u2022war or terrorist activities;\n\u2022difficulties enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions; and\n\u2022unexpected events, including fires or explosions at facilities, and natural disasters.\nPolitical and social instability, and unrest, and actual, or potential, armed conflicts in the Middle East region may affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial position.\nOur operations in KSA have been affected in the past, and may be affected in the future, by the political, social and economic conditions from time to time prevailing in, or affecting, KSA or the wider Middle East region, including by rocket attacks from armed rebel groups. For example, since 2011, a number of countries in the Middle East region have witnessed significant social unrest, including widespread public demonstrations, and, in certain cases, armed conflict, terrorist attacks, diplomatic disputes, foreign military intervention and a change of government. In addition, KSA faces a number of challenges arising mainly from the relatively high levels of unemployment among the Saudi youth population, requests for political and social changes, and the security threat posed by certain groups. Should KSA experience similar political and social unrest as found in other countries in\nthe Middle East, the Saudi Arabian economy could be adversely affected, our TiO2 plant located in Yanbu could be temporarily disrupted or materially adversely affected and our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, the Slagger, that is subject to the Option or Put (as defined elsewhere herein), is located in Jazan, KSA which has been subject to rocket attacks from armed rebel groups fighting the KSA military in Yemen. Further attacks could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nSouth Africa, where we have large mining assets and derive a significant portion of our revenue and profit, poses distinct operational risks which could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn South Africa, we currently operate two significant mining assets, as well as accompanying separation plants and smelting operations, and derive a significant portion of our profit from the sale of zircon. Our mining and smelting operations depend on electrical power generated by Eskom, the sole, state-owned energy supplier. Eskom has not been able to reliably provide electrical power and as a result \u201cload-shedding\u201d (planned and unplanned rolling power outages) is expected for the foreseeable future. In addition, in 2021, Eskom received a governmental order to reduce by one-third its operating capacity to limit its greenhouse gas emissions. Although Eskom is currently appealing the government order, there is no assurance that Eskom will be successful in its appeal. We have also experienced increased electricity prices and future price increases are expected to occur. Capacity reductions, load shedding, and/or electricity price increases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations.\nIn addition, our KZN Sands operations currently use approximately 320,000 gigajoules of Sasol gas, which is available only from Sasol Limited. As such, an interruption in the supply of Sasol gas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations.\nMoreover, certain regions of South Africa have experienced in the past, and are prone to, drought conditions resulting in water restrictions being imposed in such areas. We use significant amounts of water in our South African operations. A prolonged drought in a region of South Africa where our operations are located may lead to water use restrictions which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, under South African law, our South African mining operations are subject to water-use licenses that govern each operation. These licenses require, among other conditions, that mining operations achieve and maintain certain water quality limits for all water discharges, where applicable. Changes to water-use licenses could increase our costs of operations thereby affecting our operational results and financial condition.\nOur operations in South Africa are also reliant on services provided by the State-owned, sole provider of rail transport, Transnet Freight Rail and ocean transport, Transnet National Port Authority (collectively \"Transnet\"). Furthermore, Transnet provides extensive dockside services at both the ports of Richards Bay and Saldanha Bay. In 2021, the Transnet owned and operated Port of Richards Bay was impacted by two separate events, including a significant fire, which damaged part of the Port's infrastructure, causing increased shipment delays. Delays or interruptions at either the rail service or the ports in which we receive and/or export material could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe aforementioned operational risks, as well as any other foreseen or unforeseen operational risks primarily related to doing business in South Africa, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs an emerging market, South Africa poses a challenging array of long-term political, social and economic risks.\nSouth Africa continues to undergo political, social and economic challenges. For example, in 2021, unprecedented and politically motivated civil unrest in South Africa resulted in significant damage to the national supply chains and logistics. The primary area of unrest was near to our KZN operations. Changes to, or instability in, the economic, social or political environment in South Africa which cause civil unrest, shortages of production materials, interruptions to transportation networks, or labor unrest could result in production delays and production shortfalls, and materially impact our production and results of operations.\nThe South African government has recently embarked on a process of identifying and securing land for persons who were previously dispossessed of such land as a result of Apartheid policies. In December 2019, the South African government released a draft land expropriation bill for public comment. The land expropriation bill contemplates that, where it is in the \u201cpublic interest\u201d, land may be expropriated by the South African government, without compensation being payable to the current owners. While the South African government has indicated that such measures will be applied initially to state-owned land, it is possible that such measures may extend to agricultural and mining areas. In the event that the land on which the Namakwa Sands and KZN\nSands operations are situated areas become the subject of a land claim under any such proposed or future land expropriation bill, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe African Government's exchange control regulations require resident companies to obtain the prior approval of the South African Reserve Bank to raise capital in any currency other than the Rand, and restrict the export of capital from South Africa. While the South African government has relaxed exchange controls in recent years, it is difficult to predict whether or how it will further change or abolish exchange control measures in the future. These exchange control restrictions could hinder our financial and strategic flexibility, particularly our ability to use South African capital to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures, and new projects outside of South Africa.\nOur South African operations have been affected by inflation in South Africa in recent years. Employment costs and wages in South Africa have increased in recent years, resulting in significant cost pressures for the mining industry. Prolonged or heightened inflation and associated cost pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur South African operations have entered into various collective agreements with organized labor regulating wages and working conditions at our mines and smelter operations. There have been periods when various stakeholders have been unable to agree on dispute resolution processes, leading to threats of disruptive industrial action disputes. Due to the high level of employee union membership, our South African operations are at risk of production stoppages for indefinite periods due to strikes and other labor disputes. Although we believe that we have good labor relations with our South African employees, we may experience labor disputes in the future.\nAlthough we believe that our relationships with our various local communities are good, the areas in which our South African operations are situated are the traditional homelands of various tribal groupings that are historically politically volatile. This volatility persists today and frequently results in violent, destructive behaviors. Increased volatility and any consequential civil unrest may result in production stoppages and/or the destruction of assets which comprise our South African operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes following the U.K.\u2019s exit from the E.U. could adversely impact our operations, operating results and financial condition.\nThe U.K. has withdrawn from the E.U. (often referred to as Brexit). Since December 31, 2020, the U.K. has left the E.U. customs union and single market and is no longer required to follow E.U. laws. It is expected that Brexit will impact economic conditions in the U.K. and the E.U. but given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have and how such withdrawal will affect us.\nThe consequences of Brexit could adversely impact the markets in which we and our customers operate. Brexit could also create uncertainty with respect to the legal and regulatory requirements to which we are subject and lead to divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. government determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Due to Brexit, adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions, volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation could have a negative impact on our future operations, operating results and financial condition.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nThe financial condition and results of operations of our operating entities outside the U.S. are reported in various foreign currencies, primarily the South African Rand, Australian Dollars, Euros, Pound Sterling and Brazilian Real and then converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in the financial statements. A significant portion of our costs are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, any volatility of the U.S. dollar against these foreign currencies creates uncertainty for, and may have a negative impact on, reported sales and operating margin. In addition, our operating entities often need to convert currencies they receive for their products into currencies in which they purchase raw materials or pay for services, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates. In order to manage this risk, we have, from time to time, entered into forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currencies.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR DEBT AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE\nWe are a holding company that is dependent on cash flows from our operating subsidiaries to fund our debt obligations, capital expenditures and ongoing operations.\nAll of our operations are conducted, and all of our assets are owned, by our operating companies, which are our subsidiaries. We intend to continue to conduct our operations at the operating company level. Consequently, our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations or make cash distributions depends upon the cash flow of our operating companies, and the payment of funds by our operating companies in the form of dividends or otherwise. The ability of our operating companies to make any payments to us depends on their earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, including the terms of any credit facilities, or indentures, and legal restrictions regarding the transfer of funds.\nOur ability to service our debt and fund our planned capital expenditures and ongoing operations will depend on our ability to generate and increase cash flow, and our access to additional liquidity sources. Our ability to generate and increase cash flow is dependent on many factors, including many of other risks described in this section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d.\nThe agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could affect our ability to operate our business, as well as impact our liquidity.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our total principal amount of debt was approximately $2.6 billion. Our credit facilities contain covenants that could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our liquidity, and our results of operations. These covenants may restrict, among other things, our and our subsidiaries' ability to:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022complete asset sales, acquisitions or mergers;\n\u2022make investments and capital expenditures;\n\u2022prepay other indebtedness;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022fund additional dividends or repurchase shares.\nCertain of our indebtedness facilities and senior notes include requirements relating to the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to indebtedness or certain fixed charges. The breach of any covenants or obligations in our credit facilities, not otherwise waived or amended, could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations (and cross-defaults to certain other debt obligations) and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger other cross defaults under other existing or future agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. In addition, the secured lenders under the credit facilities could foreclose on their collateral, which includes equity interests in our subsidiaries, and exercise other rights of secured creditors. Any default under those credit facilities could adversely affect our growth, our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our credit facilities, and could force us to seek the protection of bankruptcy laws.\nWe may need additional capital in the future and may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, and such capital expenditure projects may not realize expected investment returns.\nOur business is capital intensive, and our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our manufacturing operations and invest in those operations to expand capacity and remain competitive from a cost perspective. We may require additional capital in the future to finance capital investments, including any new mines that replace mines that are end of life, potential expansion or optimization of existing production facilities or mining operations, fund ongoing research and development activities and meet general working capital needs. For instance, in 2020 we began the implementation of a multi-year global digital transformation strategy that is expected to include the establishment of increased automation of both operational and financial systems, including the global ERP, through new and upgraded systems, technology and processes. The risks relating to such digital transformation include any new information and operational technologies not being properly designed, integrated, managed, and/or implemented in a timely manner which could significantly increase the program\u2019s costs, and negatively impact our operations, including, our plant\u2019s system safety, functionality and effectiveness. Although we have taken, and will continue to take, significant steps to mitigate the potential negative impact of the implementation of such new digital systems, there can be no assurance that these procedures will be completely successful. Additionally, we entered into the Option Agreement with AMIC pursuant to which AMIC granted us an option to acquire 90% of a SPV, to which AMIC\u2019s ownership in the Slagger will be contributed together with $322 million of indebtedness currently held by AMIC. Upon exercise of the Option or Put, there can be no assurance that we may assume this indebtedness and may need to obtain funding to repay it at maturity. In the event we require any additional financing, such financing may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate funds on acceptable terms, we may be unable to maintain, expand or lower the operating costs of our facilities or take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, which could harm our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects. Additionally, if we undertake these projects, they may not be completed on schedule, at the budgeted cost, or at all. Moreover, our revenue may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. As a result, we may not be able to realize our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR LEGAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\nOur South African mining rights are subject to onerous regulatory requirements imposed by legislation and the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (the \u201cDMRE\u201d), the compliance with which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBlack economic empowerment (\u201cBEE\u201d) legislation was introduced into South Africa as a means to seek to redress the inequalities of the previous Apartheid system by requiring the inclusion of historically disadvantaged South Africans in the mainstream economy. Under BEE legislation, certain of our operations are required to be partially owned by historically disadvantaged South Africans --- known as \u201cempowerment\u201d --- and comply with other provisions of applicable BEE legislation that relate to matters such as mandatory procurement and employment opportunities for the communities in which we operate. On March 1, 2019, a new set of BEE rules and regulations relevant to our operation came into effect known as \"Mining Charter III\". Under the \u201cempowerment\u201d rules of Mining Charter III, certain of our operations require a 30% BEE shareholding that must be structured through a special purpose vehicle comprised of black entrepreneurs, the local community surrounding the relevant mining area and eligible employees. In addition, Mining Charter III sets forth more stringent requirements applicable to all of our South African operations, including: the procurement of goods and services from BEE compliant entities; race, age and gender based employment quotas; and, workers\u2019 housing and living conditions. Uncertainty over the status of Mining Charter III arose when in September 2021, the South African High Court ruled that certain provisions of Mining Charter III were unconstitutional and that Mining Charter III cannot be considered binding legislation. The DMRE is currently considering its options with respect to the court ruling. As a result, there is no assurance that all the provisions of Mining Charter III will take effect or that the DMRE as result of such ruling will not attempt to enforce the same or more onerous provisions through legislative amendments.\nPrior to Mining Charter III, BEE in the South African mining sector was governed by Mining Charter II. Under Mining Charter II, our South African operations were \u201cempowered\u201d by a 26% ownership interest in two of our South African subsidiaries by Exxaro which prior to 2017 was greater than 50% owned by historically disadvantaged South Africans. We believe that under Mining Charter III the two South African subsidiaries in which Exxaro previously held 26% became permanently \u201cempowered\u201d --- so-called, \u201conce empowered always empowered\u201d.\n\u201cOnce empowered always empowered\u201d means that a South African company that has had the requisite shareholding base consisting of historically disadvantaged South Africans as at December 31, 2014 will always qualify as an \u201cempowered\u201d entity for purposes of the retention of an existing mining right for the duration of that right. The question of whether the \u201conce empowered always empowered\u201d principle applies in the mining industry in South Africa has been subject to litigation between the Minerals Council of South Africa (the \u201cMinerals Council\u201d) (formerly the Chamber of Mines, an industry body that represents approximately 90% of the South African Mining Industry) and the DMRE. The South African High Court decided in the affirmative for the Minerals Council and such decision was subsequently confirmed on appeal. Thus, based on the High Court's ruling, the \u201conce empowered always empowered\u201d principle applies to our existing mining rights. In addition, the South African High Court in connection with its September 2021 decision with respect to the unconstitutionality of Mining Charter III also confirmed that \u201conce empowered always empowered\u201d applies to the renewal and transfer of mining rights. However, there is no assurance that DMRE may not enact new legislation that would undermine the court's ruling regarding the applicability of \"once empowered always empowered\" to the renewal and transfer of mining rights. In the event that \"once empowered always empowered\" does not ultimately apply to the renewal or transfer of mining rights it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with the anti-corruption laws of the U.S. and various international jurisdictions could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations.\nDoing business on a global basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and those of various international jurisdictions, and our failure to successfully comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to liabilities. In particular, our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (\u201cU.K. Bribery Act\u201d), as well as anti-corruption laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our global operations may expose us to the risk of violating, or being accused of violating, the foregoing or other anti-corruption laws. Such violations could be punishable by criminal fines, imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, and exclusion from government contracts, as well as other remedial measures. Investigations of alleged violations can be very expensive, disruptive, and damaging to our reputation. Although we have implemented anti-corruption policies and procedures, there can be no guarantee that these policies, procedures, and training will effectively prevent violations by our employees or representatives in the future. Additionally, we face a risk that our distributors and other business partners may violate the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, or similar laws or regulations. Such violations could expose us to FCPA and U.K. Bribery Act liability and/or our reputation may potentially be harmed by their violations and resulting sanctions and fines.\nWe may be subject to litigation, the disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe nature of our operations exposes us to possible litigation claims, including disputes with competitors, customers, equipment vendors, environmental groups and other non-governmental organizations, and providers of shipping services. Some of the lawsuits may seek fines or penalties and damages in large amounts, or seek to restrict our business activities. Because of the uncertain nature of any litigation and coverage decisions, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters or whether insurance claims may mitigate any damages to us. Litigation is very costly, and the costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See Note 20 of notes to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for further information regarding our commitments and contingencies.\nOur flexibility in managing our labor force may be adversely affected by labor and employment laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, many of which are more onerous than those of the U.S.; and some of our labor force has substantial workers' council or trade union participation, which creates a risk of disruption from labor disputes and new laws affecting employment policies.\nThe vast majority of our employees are located outside the U.S. In most of those countries, labor and employment laws are more onerous than in the U.S. and, in many cases, grant significant job protection to employees, including rights on termination of employment. Moreover, many of our workforce outside the U.S. belong to unions and/or are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. As such, in such jurisdictions we are required to consult with, and seek the consent or advice of, various employee groups or works\u2019 councils that represent our employees for any changes to our activities or employee benefits. This requirement could have a significant impact on our flexibility in managing costs and responding to market changes.\nWe are subject to many environmental, health and safety regulations.\nOur operations and production facilities are subject to extensive environmental and health and safety laws and regulations at national, international and local levels in numerous jurisdictions relating to use of natural resources, pollution, protection of the environment, mine site remediation, transporting and storing raw materials and finished products, and storing and disposing of hazardous wastes among other materials. Moreover, certain environmental laws impose joint and several and/or strict liability for costs to clean up and restore sites where pollutants have been disposed or otherwise spilled or released. We cannot be certain that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities for remediation or damage to property, natural resources or persons as a result of spills or releases from our operations or those of a third party.\nThe costs of compliance with the extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or the inability to obtain, update or renew permits required for operation or expansion of our business could negatively impact our results of operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. If we fail to comply with the conditions of our permits governing the production and management of regulated materials, mineral sands mining licenses or leases or the provisions of the relevant jurisdictional laws in which we operate, these permits, mining licenses or leases and mining rights could be canceled or suspended, and we could be prevented from obtaining new mining and prospecting rights, which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, we could incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations, for violations arising under these laws and regulations, including operating without the required permits, mining licenses or leases and/or mining rights. In the event of a catastrophic incident involving any of the raw materials we use, or chemicals or mineral products we produce, we could incur material costs as a result of addressing the consequences of such event.\nChanges to existing laws governing operations, especially changes in laws relating to transportation of mineral resources, the treatment of land and infrastructure, contaminated land, the remediation of mines, tax royalties, waste handling and management, exchange control restrictions, environmental remediation, mineral rights, ownership of mining assets, or the rights to prospect and mine may have a material adverse effect on our future business operations and financial performance. There is risk that onerous conditions may be attached to authorizations in the form of mining rights, water-use licenses, miscellaneous licenses and environmental approvals, or that the grant of these approvals may be delayed or not granted.\nOur TiO2 products are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny, that may impede or inhibit widespread usage of TiO2 and / or diminish the Company\u2019s ability to sustain or grow its business or may add significant costs of doing business.\nCurrent regulatory and societal demands for increased protection against products which may cause cancer, genetic mutations or other long-term health problems are resulting in increased pressure for more stringent regulation of our TiO2 products. We expect these trends to continue and the ultimate cost of compliance could be material. In particular, changes to product safety\nregulations could limit the use of, and demand for, our TiO2 products, require investment in new product development or the way we manufacture our existing products, and increase regulatory compliance expenditures for us and our suppliers.\nFor instance, the European Commission has recently adopted a regulation classifying certain forms of TiO2 with a particular aerodynamic diameter as a Category 2 carcinogen by inhalation, with the applicable labelling regulation coming into effect in October 2021. The classification of TiO2 as a Category 2 Carcinogen could impact our business by inhibiting the marketing of products containing TiO2 to consumers, and subject our manufacturing operations to new regulations that could increase costs. The Category 2 classification and labelling requirements could have additional effects under other EU laws (e.g., those affecting medical and pharmaceutical applications, cosmetics, food packaging and food additives) and/or trigger heightened regulatory scrutiny in countries and local jurisdictions outside the EU based on health and safety grounds. For instance, the Health and Safety Executive in the U.K. has published the U.K.\u2019s mandatory classification and labelling list, which includes the classification of TiO2 as a suspected carcinogen (in a powder form containing 1% or more of particles with aerodynamic diameter \u2264 10 \u03bcm). The classification became mandatory in the U.K. in October 2021.\nIn May 2021, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) announced new guidelines which concluded that a certain digestible form of TiO2 known as E171 is no longer considered safe as a food additive due to uncertainty for genotoxicity. Though we do not manufacture E171, the EFSA guidelines indicate additional regulatory review of our TiO2 products is likely which could result in more stringent qualifications and use-restriction being applied or to the introduction of further classifications. It is also possible that heightened regulatory scrutiny could lead to claims by consumers or those involved in the production of such products alleging adverse health impacts. In addition, there is no assurance that other materials which we add to our TiO2 products could also be subject to increased regulation which could impact the cost of labelling or the sales of our products.\nESG issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as damage our reputation.\nThe majority of our greenhouse gas emissions are generated from our TiO2 slag furnaces in South Africa, synthetic rutile kiln in Australia, and TiO2 pigment plants in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Brazil, China, Netherlands, Australia, and Saudi Arabia. Concerns about the relationship between greenhouse gases and global climate change, and an increased focus on carbon neutrality, may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements on both national and supranational levels, to monitor, regulate, control and tax emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. A number of governmental bodies have already introduced, or are contemplating, regulatory changes in response to climate change, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions. Any laws or regulations that are adopted to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could, among other things, (i) cause an increase to our raw material costs, (ii) increase our costs to operate and maintain our facilities, and (iii) increase costs to administer and manage emissions programs.\nIn addition, companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG policies. Increased focus and activism related to ESG may hinder the Company\u2019s access to capital, as investors may reconsider their capital investment as a result of their assessment of the Company\u2019s ESG practices. In particular, customers, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues, including climate change, water use, and other sustainability concerns. Moreover, increased regulatory requirements, including in relation to various aspects of ESG including disclosure requirements, may result in increased compliance or input costs of energy, raw materials or compliance with emissions standards, which may cause disruptions in the manufacture of our products or an increase in operating costs. Any failure to achieve our ESG goals or a perception of our failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning environmental or other ESG matters, or increased operating or manufacturing costs due to increased regulation, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our reputation.\nIf our intellectual property were compromised or copied by competitors, or if competitors were to develop similar intellectual property independently, our results of operations could be negatively affected. Further, third parties may claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights which could result in costly litigation.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our patents and unpatented proprietary technology, operational knowledge and other trade secrets (collectively \"intellectual property rights\"). The undetected or unremedied unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights or the legitimate development or acquisition of intellectual property related to our industry by third parties could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have as a result of our intellectual property rights. If we must take legal action to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights, any suits or proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources and our management\u2019s attention, and we may not prevail in any such suits or proceedings. A failure to protect, defend or enforce our intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough there are currently no pending or threatened proceedings or claims known to us that are material relating to alleged infringement, misappropriation or violation of the intellectual property rights of others, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the future in which third parties allege that their patents or other intellectual property rights are infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated by us or our products or processes. In the event that any such infringement, misappropriation or violation of the intellectual property rights of others is found, we may need to obtain licenses from those parties or substantially re-engineer our products or processes to avoid such infringement, misappropriation or violation. We might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or be able to re-engineer our products or processes successfully. Moreover, if we are found by a court of law to infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others, we could be required to pay substantial damages or be enjoined from making, using or selling the infringing products or technology. We also could be enjoined from making, using or selling the allegedly infringing products or technology pending the final outcome of the suit. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATING TO ACCOUNTING AND TAXATION\nIf our intangible assets or other long-lived assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant noncash charge to earnings.\nWe have a significant amount of intangible assets and other long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Under U.S. GAAP, we review our intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets and other long-lived assets may not be recoverable, include, but are not limited to, a significant decline in share price and market capitalization, changes in the industries in which we operate, particularly the impact of a downturn in the global economy, as well as competition or other factors leading to reduction in expected long-term sales or results of operations. We may be required to record a significant noncash charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our intangible assets and other long-lived assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nOur ability to use our tax attributes to offset future income may be limited.\nOur ability to use net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and Section 163(j) interest expense carryforwards generated by us could be substantially limited if we were to experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\"the Code\"). In general, an ownership change would occur if our \u201c5-percent shareholders,\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Code and including certain groups of persons treated as \u201c5-percent shareholders,\u201d collectively increased their ownership in us by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Although we believe we have sufficient protection of our approximately $4.3 billion of NOLs and/or approximately $856 million of Section 163(j) interest expense carryforwards, there can be no assurance that an ownership change for U.S. federal and applicable state income tax purposes will not occur in the future. A corporation that experiences an ownership change will generally be subject to an annual limitation on the use of certain pre-ownership change losses and/or credits. Such a limitation could, for any given year, have the effect of increasing the amount of our U.S. federal and/or state income tax liability, which would negatively impact our financial condition and the amount of after-tax cash available for distribution to holders of our ordinary shares if declared by our board of directors.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States, United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, Brazil and various other foreign jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. From time to time, the U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. From time to time, we are also subject to tax audits by various taxing authorities. Although we believe our tax positions are appropriate, the final determination of any future tax audits could be materially different from our income tax provisions, accruals and reserves and any such unfavorable outcome from a future tax audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nFailure to meet some or all of our key financial and non-financial targets could negatively impact the value of our business and adversely affect our stock price.\nFrom time to time, we may announce certain key financial and non-financial targets that are expected to serve as benchmarks for our performance for a given time period, such as, projections for our future revenue growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted\ndiluted earnings per share and free cash flow. Our failure to meet one or more of these key financial targets may negatively impact our results of operations, stock price, and stockholder returns. The factors influencing our ability to meet these key financial targets include, but are not limited to, changes in the global economic environment relating to our TiO2 products and zircon, changes in our competitive landscape, including our relationships with new or existing customers, our ability to introduce new products, applications, or technologies, our undertaking an acquisition, joint venture, or other strategic arrangement, and other factors described within this Item 1A - Risk Factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nRISKS RELATING TO INVESTING IN OUR ORDINARY SHARES\nConcentrated ownership of our ordinary shares by Cristal may prevent minority shareholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Cristal Inorganic, an affiliate of Cristal owned approximately 24% of our outstanding ordinary shares. As such, Cristal Inorganic may be able to influence fundamental corporate matters and transactions. This concentration of ownership, may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other shareholders. The interests of Cristal Inorganic may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other shareholders. Also, Cristal Inorganic may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us, but which might involve risks to our other shareholders or adversely affect us or our other shareholders.\nIn addition, under the shareholders agreement (the \u201cCristal Shareholders Agreement\u201d) we entered into at the closing of the Cristal Transaction with Cristal, as long as Cristal Inorganic and the three shareholders of Cristal (collectively, the \u201cCristal Shareholders\u201d) collectively beneficially own at least 24,900,000 or more of our ordinary shares, they have the right to designate for nomination two directors of our board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d). As long as the Cristal Shareholders collectively beneficially own at least 12,450,000 ordinary shares but less than 24,900,000 ordinary shares, they have the right to designate for nomination one director of the Board. The Cristal Shareholders Agreement also provides that as long as the Cristal Shareholders collectively beneficially own at least 12,450,000 ordinary shares they have certain preemptive rights. Also, pursuant to the Cristal Shareholders Agreement, we have filed a universal shelf registration statement which is currently effective and which currently would cover 6,532,738 shares owned by Cristal. Other than with respect to those shares, the Cristal Shareholders Agreement includes certain restrictions on Cristal Inorganic\u2019s ability to transfer any of its ordinary shares prior to December 31, 2022 if such transfer would cause an \"ownership change\" as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nAs a result of these or other factors, including as a result of any offering of shares by Cristal, or the perception that such sales may occur, the market price of our ordinary shares could decline. In addition, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our ordinary shares because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with significant shareholders or with significant outstanding shares with registration rights.\nEnglish law and provisions in our articles of association may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our shareholders, and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management.\nCertain provisions of the U.K. Companies Act 2006 (the \u201cCompanies Act\u201d) and our articles of association may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. For example, our articles of association include provisions that:\n\u2022maintain an advance notice procedure for proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022provide certain mandatory offer provisions, including, among other provisions, that a shareholder, together with persons acting in concert, that acquires 30 percent or more of our issued shares without making an offer to all of our other shareholders that is in cash or accompanied by a cash alternative would be at risk of certain sanctions from our board of directors unless they acted with the prior consent of our board of directors or the prior approval of the shareholders; and\n\u2022provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled by a vote of the directors or by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders.\nIn addition, public limited companies are prohibited under the Companies Act from taking shareholder action by written resolution. These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nAlthough we do not anticipate being subject to the U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, such Takeover Code may still have anti-takeover effects in the event the Takeover Panel determines that such Code is applicable to us.\nThe U.K. City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the \u201cTakeover Code\u201d) applies, among other things, to an offer for a public company whose registered office is in the U.K. (or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man) and whose securities are not admitted to trading on a regulated market in the U.K. (or on any stock exchange in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man) if the company is considered by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (the \u201cTakeover Panel\u201d) to have its place of central management and control in the U.K. (or the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man). This is known as the \u201cresidency test.\u201d The test for central management and control under the Takeover Code is different from that used by the U.K. tax authorities. Under the Takeover Code, the Takeover Panel will determine whether we have our place of central management and control in the U.K. by looking at various factors, including the structure of our board of directors, the functions of the directors and where they are resident.\nGiven that currently all of the members of our Board of Directors reside outside the United Kingdom, we do not anticipate that we will be subject to the Takeover Code. However, if at the time of a takeover offer, the Takeover Panel determines that we have our place of central management and control in the U.K., we would be subject to a number of rules and restrictions, including but not limited to the following: (1) our ability to enter into deal protection arrangements with a bidder would be extremely limited; (2) we might not, without the approval of our shareholders, be able to perform certain actions that could have the effect of frustrating an offer, such as issuing shares or carrying out acquisitions or disposals; and (3) we would be obliged to provide equality of information to all bona fide competing bidders.\nAs a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales, certain capital structure decisions requires approval of our shareholders, which may limit our flexibility to manage our capital structure.\nThe Companies Act generally provides that a board of directors of a public limited company may only allot shares (or grant rights to subscribe for or convertible into shares) with the prior authorization of shareholders, such authorization stating the maximum amount of shares that may be allotted under such authorization and specifying the date on which such authorization will expire, being not more than five years, each as specified in the articles of association or relevant shareholder resolution. We obtained previous shareholder authority to allot additional shares for a period of five years from February 25, 2019, which authorization will need to be renewed at least upon expiration (five years from February 25, 2019) but may be sought more frequently for additional five-year terms (or any shorter period).\nThe Companies Act generally provides that existing shareholders of a company have statutory pre-emption rights when new shares in such company are allotted and issued for cash. However, it is possible for such statutory pre-emption right to be disapplied by either shareholders passing a special resolution at a general meeting, being a resolution passed by at least 75% of the votes cast, or by inclusion of relevant provisions in the articles of association of the company. Such a disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights may not be for more than five years. We obtained previous shareholder authority to disapply statutory pre-emption rights for a period of five years from February 25, 2019, which disapplication will need to be renewed upon expiration (i.e., at least every five years) to remain effective, but may be sought more frequently for additional five-year terms (or any shorter period).\nThe Companies Act generally prohibits a public limited company from repurchasing its own shares without the prior approval of its shareholders by ordinary resolution, being a resolution passed by a simple majority of votes cast, and subject to compliance with other statutory formalities. Such authorization may not be for more than five years from the date on which such ordinary resolution is passed. We obtained previous shareholder authority to repurchase shares for a period of five years from February 25, 2019, which authorization will need to be renewed at least upon expiration (i.e., five years from February 25, 2019) but may be sought more frequently for additional five-year terms (or any shorter period).\nTransfers of our ordinary shares outside The Depository Trust may be subject to stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax in the U.K., which would increase the cost of dealing in our shares.\nExcept for ordinary shares received by a holder deemed to be an affiliate of us for purposes of U.S. securities laws, our ordinary shares have been issued to a nominee for The Depository Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d) and corresponding book-entry interests credited in the facilities of DTC. On the basis of current law and HM Revenue and Customs (\u201cHMRC\u201d) practice, no charges to U.K. stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (\u201cSDRT\u201d) are expected to arise on the issue of the ordinary shares into DTC\u2019s facilities or on transfers of book-entry interests in ordinary shares within DTC\u2019s facilities.\nShareholders are strongly encouraged to hold their ordinary shares in book entry form through DTC. Transfers of shares held in book entry form through DTC currently do not attract a charge to stamp duty or SDRT in the U.K. A transfer of title in the shares from within the DTC system out of DTC, including to certificate shares, and any subsequent transfers that occur entirely outside the DTC system will attract a charge to stamp duty at a rate of 0.5% of any consideration, which is payable by the transferee of the shares. Any such duty must be paid (and the relevant transfer document, if any, stamped by HMRC) before the\ntransfer can be registered in our books. However, if those shares are redeposited into DTC, the redeposit will attract stamp duty or SDRT at the rate of 1.5% to be paid by the transferor.\nWe have put arrangements in place such that directly held ordinary shares cannot be transferred into the DTC system until the transferor of the ordinary shares has first delivered the ordinary shares to a depositary specified by us so that SDRT may be collected in connection with the initial delivery to the depositary. Any such ordinary shares will be evidenced by a receipt issued by the depositary. Before the transfer can be registered in our books, the transferor will also be required to put the depositary in funds to settle the resultant liability to SDRT, which will be charged at a rate of 1.5% of the value of the shares.\nOur articles of association provide that the courts of England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction to determine any dispute brought by a shareholder in that shareholder's capacity as such and certain other matters.\nOur articles of association provide that the courts of England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction to determine any dispute brought by a shareholder in that shareholder's capacity as such, or related to or connected with any derivative claim in respect of a cause of action vested in us or seeking relief on our behalf, against us and/or the board and/or any of the directors, former directors, officers, employees or shareholders individually, arising out of or in connection with our articles of association or (to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law) otherwise. This choice of forum provision may limit a shareholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder believes is favorable for disputes with us or our directors, former directors, officers, employees or shareholders which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, former directors, officers, employees or shareholders.\nThere may be difficulty in effecting service of legal process and enforcing judgments against us and our directors and management.\nWe are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside of the U.S. The U.S. and the U.K. do not currently have a treaty providing for the recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. The enforceability of any judgment of a U.S. federal or state court in the U.K. will depend on the laws and any treaties in effect at the time, including conflicts of laws principles (such as those bearing on the question of whether a U.K. court would recognize the basis on which a U.S. court had purported to exercise jurisdiction over a defendant). In this context, there is doubt as to the enforceability in the U.K. of civil liabilities based solely on the federal securities laws of the U.S. In addition, awards for punitive damages in actions brought in the U.S. or elsewhere may be unenforceable in the U.K.. An award for monetary damages under U.S. securities laws would likely be considered punitive if it did not seek to compensate the claimant for loss or damage suffered and was intended to punish the defendant.", "PERMNO": 91153, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "TROX"}
