{"cik": "1274792", "company": "MERRIMACK PHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. Please see page 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of some of the forward-looking statements that are qualified by these risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy\nOur business strategy depends substantially upon our ability to receive future contingent milestone payments.\nOur business strategy depends substantially upon our ability to receive future milestone payments from Ipsen and Elevation. On May 30, 2019, we announced the completion of our review of strategic alternatives. Following this review, our board of directors implemented a series of measures designed to extend our cash runway into 2027 and preserve our ability to capture the potential milestone payments resulting from the Ipsen sale. We are entitled to receive up to $450.0 million in contingent milestone payments related to our sale of ONIVYDE to Ipsen and up to $54.5 million in contingent milestone payments related to our sale of MM-121 and MM-111 to Elevation. We do not have any ongoing research or development activities. Any failure to achieve such milestones or a perception that the milestones may not be achieved will materially and adversely affect the company and the value of the common stock.\nEven if some or all of the milestones set forth in the Ipsen sale agreement and Elevation agreement are achieved, it may take significantly longer than we anticipate and could require us to raise additional funding in order to maintain our ability to receive payment for such milestones.\nAchievement of the milestones set forth in the Ipsen sale agreement and the Elevation agreement are not guaranteed and there is significant risk that some or all of such milestones will not be achieved when anticipated, if at all. If achievement of the milestones is delayed beyond what we currently anticipate, it could require us to raise additional funds in order to maintain our ability to receive payment for the potential future achievement of such milestones. Sources of funds may not be available or, if available, may not be available on terms satisfactory to us. Raising additional funds could be dilutive or otherwise disadvantageous to our stockholders. Any delay in receipt of the potential benefit to the company or our stockholders resulting from achievement of such milestones, in addition to any additional uncertainty as to whether such milestones will be achieved at all, would materially and adversely affect the company and the value of the common stock.\nWe rely on external consultants for the execution of our business strategy.\nWe do not have any employees and instead use a limited number of external consultants for the operation of our company, any of whom may terminate their consultancy with us at any time. The loss of some or all of our consultants could delay or inhibit our ability to run our operations or consummate any divestitures of our remaining assets or could interfere with our ability to receive and distribute any potential milestones from Ipsen or Elevation.\nWe may be treated as a \"public shell\" company which could have negative consequences, including potential Nasdaq delisting of our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Market. We have no current plans to delist our common stock from Nasdaq. However, following our cessation of normal business operations, we may be treated as a \u201cpublic shell\u201d company under the Nasdaq rules and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, or the Exchange Act. Although Nasdaq evaluates whether a listed company is a public shell company based on a facts and circumstances determination, a Nasdaq-listed company with no or nominal operations and either no or nominal assets, assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents, or assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets is generally considered to be a public shell company. Listed companies determined to be public shell companies by Nasdaq may be subject to delisting proceedings or additional and more stringent listing criteria.\nIf our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, or if in the future we determine to delist our common stock, we would expect that such securities would qualify for trading over-the-counter, or OTC, in the United States on a market colloquially referred to as the \u201cPink Sheets.\u201d Securities quoted OTC are generally subject to lesser requirements than securities listed for trading on a U.S. national stock exchange, such as Nasdaq, including reduced corporate governance and public reporting standards.\nIf Nasdaq should delist our common stock from trading, or if in the future we determine to delist our common stock, a reduction in some or all of the following may occur, each of which could have a material adverse effect on holders of our common stock: the liquidity of our common stock; the market price of the common stock; the number of institutional and general investors that will consider investing in the common stock; the number of investors in general that will consider investing in the common stock; the number of market makers in our common stock; the availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of the common stock; and the number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in our common stock. In addition to the foregoing, there are certain consequences under the Securities Act of being a public shell company, including the unavailability of Rule 144 thereunder for the resale of restricted securities and the inability to utilize Form S-8 for the registration of employee benefit plan securities.\nWe have been, and in the future may be, subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert our attention.\nWe have been, and may in the future be, subject to securities class action litigation. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention, which could seriously harm our business.\nActions of activist stockholders against us could be disruptive and potentially costly and the possibility that activist stockholders may seek changes that contest, or conflict with, our strategic direction could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.\nActivist stockholders may from time to time attempt to effect changes in our strategic direction and, in furtherance thereof, may seek changes in how we are governed. While our board of directors and management strive to maintain constructive, ongoing communications with all of our stockholders, including activist stockholders, and welcomes their views and opinions with the goal of working together constructively to enhance value for all stockholders, activist campaigns that contest, or conflict with, our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on us because:\n\u2022\nresponding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of our board of directors and management from the pursuit of business strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition;\n\u2022\nperceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of changes to the composition of our board of directors may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors, may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners;\n\u2022\nthese types of actions could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business; and\n\u2022\nif individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our stockholders.\nIn connection with our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, an activist investor initially proposed its own slate of director candidates. That activist investor ultimately withdrew its slate of director candidates prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and all of our director nominees were elected at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. In connection with our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, an activist investor submitted a shareholder proposal requiring the board of directors to amend our company charter and/or bylaws, as necessary, to require the chair of our board of directors, whenever possible, to be a non-management, independent member of the board and if the board determined that a chair who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the board would be required to select a new chair who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time. The shareholder proposal was not approved by our shareholders. That activist investor continues to have a Schedule 13D filed with respect to us and it remains a possibility that such activist investor may still, from time to time, attempt to effect changes in our strategic direction and, in furtherance thereof, may seek changes in how we are governed.\nRisks Related to the Sale and Divestiture of Assets\nThere can be no guarantee that Ipsen will comply with its obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts in connection with the development of ONIVYDE or that the milestones set forth in the Ipsen sale agreement will be achieved.\nIpsen has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop ONIVYDE in connection with obtaining the regulatory approval by the FDA of ONIVYDE for certain indications. There is no guarantee that Ipsen will undertake such development however, or that any of its efforts will lead to the successful approval of ONIVYDE for such additional indications or lead to achievement of the milestones set forth in the Ipsen sale agreement. We also do not have any right to receive updates on the progress of Ipsen\u2019s development of ONIVYDE beyond what Ipsen chooses to disclose publicly. The milestones set forth in the Ipsen sale\nagreement may not be achieved and we may not receive any future contingent payments. As a result, material information about the progress, if any, on the milestones will not be made publicly available unless Ipsen publicly discloses such information.\nOur business strategy depends substantially upon our ability to receive future milestone payments from Ipsen. Any failure to achieve such milestones or a perception that the milestones may not be achieved will materially and adversely affect the company and the value of the common stock.\nThere can be no guarantee that Elevation will comply with its obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts in connection with the development of MM-121 and MM-111 or that the milestones set forth in the asset purchase agreement with Elevation will be achieved.\nElevation has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop MM-121 and MM-111. However, there is no guarantee that Elevation will take the steps set forth in the Elevation agreement or that any of its efforts will lead to the successful approval of MM-121 or MM-111 by the FDA or other regulatory bodies. The milestones set forth in the Elevation agreement may not be achieved and we may not receive any future contingent payments. Because our business strategy depends substantially upon our ability to receive future milestone payments, including from Elevation, any failure to achieve such milestones or a perception that the milestones may not be achieved will materially and adversely affect the company and the value of the common stock.\nIpsen did not assume any of the excluded liabilities under the Ipsen sale agreement.\nPursuant to the Ipsen sale agreement, Ipsen assumed only certain specified liabilities set forth in the Ipsen sale agreement and did not assume all of the liabilities associated with the commercial business. Certain liabilities remain with us post-closing. While we believe that we have adequately accrued for these liabilities or are adequately insured against certain of the risks associated with such excluded liabilities, we could incur additional expenditures in resolving any such liabilities. If we become subject to liability based upon such contractual obligations or otherwise and we are required to indemnify the counterparties, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nElevation did not assume any of the excluded liabilities under the Elevation agreement.\nPursuant to the Elevation agreement, Elevation assumed only certain specified liabilities set forth in the Elevation agreement and did not assume all of the liabilities associated with MM-121 or MM-111. Certain liabilities remain with us post-closing. While we believe that we have adequately accrued for these liabilities or are adequately insured against certain of the risks associated with such excluded liabilities, we could incur additional expenditures in resolving any such liabilities. If we become subject to liability based upon such contractual obligations or otherwise and we are required to indemnify the counterparties, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nThe Ipsen sale agreement may expose us to contingent liabilities.\nWe have agreed to indemnify Ipsen for certain breaches of representations, warranties or covenants made by us in the Ipsen sale agreement and for certain specified existing litigation. We have agreed that if we cannot pay our indemnification obligations, Ipsen will have set-off rights against any future contingent payments. Indemnification claims by Ipsen could further materially and adversely affect our financial condition and/or significantly reduce any future contingent payments.\nThe Elevation agreement may expose us to contingent liabilities.\nWe have agreed to indemnify Elevation for certain breaches of representations, warranties or covenants made by us in the Elevation agreement. We have agreed that Elevation will have set-off rights against any future contingent payments. Indemnification claims by Elevation could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and/or significantly reduce any future contingent payments.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nSince inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss from continuing operations was $3.0 million and $21.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $543.6 million. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of convertible preferred stock, collaborations, public offerings of our securities, secured debt financings, sales of ONIVYDE and the Ipsen sale. We had\ndevoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development, including clinical trials and to commercialization of our first product, ONIVYDE, which was sold to Ipsen. We have not completed development of or commercialized any other product candidates or diagnostics other than ONIVYDE.\nAlthough we are not actively developing product candidates and do not have any current plans to do so, to become and remain profitable, we would need to succeed in developing and commercializing products with significant market potential. This would require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including discovering product candidates, completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates and manufacturing, marketing and selling or partnering those products for which we may in the future seek and receive regulatory approval. We may never undertake or succeed in these activities and may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business or diversify our product offerings, to the extent we undertake such activities, or continue our operations. A decline in the value of our company could also cause our stockholders to lose all or part of their investment.\nIn the event we determine to pursue any future product development efforts, we will need substantial additional funding. In that case, if we are unable to raise capital when needed, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate such product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nIn the event we determine to pursue any future product development efforts, we will need substantial additional funding. Although we are not currently developing our product candidates and do not have any current plans to do so, we expect that we would incur significant research and development expenses to the extent that we decide to do so. In addition, we may need additional funding to execute our business strategy and maintain our ability to receive payment for some or all of the milestones set forth in the Ipsen sale agreement or the Elevation agreement. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate any such future research and development programs or commercialization efforts and/or we could be forced to revise or abandon our current business strategy.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nwhether we realize the anticipated cost savings in connection with our restructuring efforts;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully divest our product candidates and other assets;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of potential milestone payments related to ONIVYDE that we may receive from Ipsen and Servier;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of potential milestone payments that we may receive from Elevation;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of any special dividend to our stockholders that our board of directors may declare;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of general and administrative expenses required to continue to operate our company;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we owe any taxes for current, future or prior periods, including as a result of any audits by taxing authorities;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we invest in any future research or development activities of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products and technologies; and\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with operating as a public company and maintaining compliance with exchange listing and SEC requirements.\nConducting preclinical testing and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may never generate the necessary data required to obtain regulatory approval and, even if regulatory approval is obtained, achieve product sales of any of our product candidates. In addition, any of our product candidates, even if approved, may not achieve commercial success. If we undertake future development of our product candidates but fail to generate sufficient revenues from collaborations or the commercialization of any of our product candidates, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives.\nWe might not be able to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $206.8 million and $292.2 million, respectively. Our existing federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2033. We also had available research and development credits for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $28.8 million and $20.3 million, respectively. The federal and state research and development credits will begin to expire in 2022 and 2025, respectively. We also had federal Orphan Drug Credits of approximately $122.7 million that begin to expire in 2031. These net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could expire unused or could be unavailable to offset our future income tax liabilities. Under federal income tax law, federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited. It is uncertain how various states will respond to this change in federal tax laws. If our ability to use our historical net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations. In addition, the Ipsen sale was an installment sale given the potential milestone payments that could be received by us in future years. If we receive milestone payments in future years pursuant to the Ipsen sale, we will be liable for interest to the federal government pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 453A and state governments pursuant to similar state tax provisions because it was an installment sale. The interest is compounding and is calculated based on the number of years between 2017 and the year the milestone payment is received by us. Any interest charges can not be offset by net operating loss carryforwards or tax credits.\nOur investments are subject to risks that could result in losses.\nWe have invested and plan to continue to invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments, principally securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, investment grade corporate bonds, including commercial paper, and money market instruments. All of these investments are subject to credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risk. Such risks, including the failure or severe financial distress of the financial institutions that hold our cash, cash equivalents and investments, may result in a loss of liquidity, impairment to our investments, realization of substantial future losses, or a complete loss of the investments in the long-term, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. In order to manage the risk to our investments, we maintain an investment policy that, among other things, limits the amount that we may invest in any one issue or any single issuer and requires us to only invest in high credit quality securities, but there can be no guarantee that our investments will not result in losses.\nRisks Related to the Development and Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nAlthough we have in the past depended heavily on the success of our product candidates, we do not have any product candidates currently in active development. Future clinical trials of our few remaining product candidates, if any, may not be successful. If we are unable to successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nAlthough we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our product candidates for the treatment of various types of cancer, we are no longer actively developing any of our product candidates. Our ability to generate meaningful product revenues will depend heavily on the successful development of our product candidates, if pursued. To the extent that we pursue development in the future of any of our few remaining product candidates, success will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nsuccessful enrollment in, and completion of, preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nreceipt of marketing approvals from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities outside the United States for our product candidates, including our diagnostics;\n\u2022\nestablishing manufacturing capabilities, which we would anticipate doing primarily through arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022\nlaunching commercial sales of any approved products, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u2022\nacceptance of any approved products by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u2022\neffectively competing with other therapies;\n\u2022\na continued acceptable safety profile of any products following approval; and\n\u2022\nqualifying for, maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims.\nIf we do not undertake development of any product candidates or achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully develop our product candidates, which would materially harm our business.\nTo the extent that we conduct clinical trials of our product candidates in the future and such trials fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe may never receive approval to commercialize our few remaining product candidates in the United States or other jurisdictions nor are we seeking such approval. If we were to seek such approval and before obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates, we would be required to conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. To the extent that we conduct clinical trials of our product candidates, a failure of one or more of such trials could occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and successful interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict successful final results.\nIf we sought to commercialize any of our remaining product candidates, we may experience numerous unexpected events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022\nclinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be insufficient or slower than we anticipate or patients may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nwe might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding of a lack of clinical response or a finding that the patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of our product candidates, companion diagnostics or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate or prohibitively expensive; and\n\u2022\nour product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators to suspend or terminate the trials.\nPreclinical and clinical data may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. Many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our few remaining product candidates beyond those that we contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nnot obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022\nobtain approval for indications that are not as broad as intended;\n\u2022\nhave the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval;\n\u2022\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;\n\u2022\nbe subject to restrictions on how the product is distributed or used; or\n\u2022\nbe unable to obtain reimbursement for use of the product.\nDelays in testing or approvals may result in increases to our product development costs. Significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nIf serious adverse or undesirable side effects are identified during the development of our product candidates or following their approval and commercialization, we may need to modify or abandon our development or marketing of such product or product candidate.\nAlthough we are not actively developing any of our product candidates, to the extent that we do decide to undertake development, the risk of failure is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval, and it is impossible to ensure that safety or efficacy issues will not arise following regulatory approval. Currently marketed therapies for solid tumors are generally limited to some extent by their toxicity. Use of our product candidates as monotherapies in clinical trials also has resulted in adverse events consistent in nature with other marketed therapies. When used in combination with other marketed or investigational therapies, our product candidates may exacerbate adverse events associated with the other therapy. If our products or product candidates, either alone or in combination with other therapies, result in undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to modify or abandon any such future development or marketing.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and an even greater risk related to the commercial sale of any products that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that any of our product candidates caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for the products or product candidates that we may develop;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of patients from clinical trials;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize any products that we may develop.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we fail to fulfill our obligations under our intellectual property licenses with third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to intellectual property license agreements with third parties and may enter into additional license agreements in the future, although we do not currently expect to enter into such agreements. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that any future license agreements would impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with these obligations, our licensors may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we might not be able to develop and market any product that is covered by these agreements. Termination of these licenses or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms. The occurrence of such events could materially harm our business.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if our licensors are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for the technology or products that we license from them, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nOur product development strategy depends in large part on our licensors\u2019 ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. In some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology or products that we license from third parties. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and applications will be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. In addition, if third parties who license patents to us fail to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated.\nWe have sought to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business. This process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our licensors\u2019 patent rights are highly uncertain. Our licensors\u2019 pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect our technology or products or that effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned and licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first to file a patent application is entitled to the patent. Under the America Invents Act enacted in 2011, the United States moved to this first to file system in 2013 from the previous system under which the first to make the claimed invention was entitled to the patent. We may become involved in opposition, interference or derivation proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such proceeding could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights.\nEven if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors from competing with us or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop or prevent us from stopping others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to initiate infringement lawsuits, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the enforceable proprietary rights of third parties. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology, including interference or derivation proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our products and technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates, prevent us from divesting certain assets or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties can have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nMany of our former employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses, and could distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development or other activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace and operate our business.\nRisks Related to Data Protection and Cybersecurity\nOur failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions, private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nWe are subject to data protection laws and regulations that address privacy and data security. The legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection continues to evolve, and in recent years there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions, which could include civil or criminal penalties, private litigation and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (e.g., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. We could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information in a manner that is not authorized or permitted.\nThe collection and use of personal health data in the European Union is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which came into effect in May 2018. This regulation imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data\nprocessing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the European Union Member States may result in significant fines and other administrative penalties.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or security breaches could adversely affect our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including, among other things, trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information). It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties, and as a result we manage a number of third-party vendors who have or could have access to our confidential information. Our information technology systems, and those of third-party vendors with whom we contract, and the large amounts of confidential information stored on those systems, make such systems vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our consultants, third-party vendors, and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties. Because we outsource our information technology systems, we are subject to risks that the activities of our third-party vendors may adversely affect our business even if an attack or breach does not directly target our systems. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Cyber-attacks could also include phishing attempts or e-mail fraud to cause payments or information to be transmitted to an unintended recipient.\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems, or those of our third-party vendors, or security breaches could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss, misappropriation and/or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential information, including, among other things, trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us. For example, any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our patients or employees, could harm our reputation, require us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Security breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security measures to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent service interruptions or security breaches that could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Personnel Matters\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain qualified personnel.\nWe do not have any employees and instead use a limited number of external consultants for the operation of our company, any of whom may terminate their consultancy with us at any time. We may not be able to attract and retain consultants on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance.\nOur corporate compliance efforts cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and other authorities within the United States and numerous entities outside of the United States. We cannot provide any assurance that governmental authorities will find that our business practices comply with current or future administrative or judicial interpretations of potentially applicable laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with any of these laws and regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, including suspension or termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product candidate, restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of products from the market, significant fines, disqualification or debarment from participation in federally-funded healthcare programs or other sanctions or litigation, any of which events may have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur directors and principal stockholders maintain the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nOur directors and stockholders who own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, in the aggregate, beneficially own a large portion of our capital stock. As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to significantly influence all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, would significantly influence the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting power could discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other stockholders may desire.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and our bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. Among others, these provisions:\n\u2022\nallow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and nominations to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nrequire that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our charter or bylaws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nWe have entered into a Section 382 Rights Agreement, and if the share purchase rights issued pursuant to such agreement are exercised, it could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe entered into a Section 382 Rights Agreement, or the Rights Agreement, on December 3, 2019, with Computershare Trust Company, N.A., a federally chartered trust company, as Rights Agent. The Rights Agreement is intended to discourage acquisitions of our common stock which could result in a cumulative \u201cownership change\u201d as defined under Section 382, thereby preserving our current ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards to offset future income tax obligations, which would become subject to limitations if we were to experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined under Section 382. While this Rights Agreement is intended to preserve our current ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards, it effectively deters current and future purchasers from accumulating 4.9% or more of our common stock, which could delay or discourage takeover attempts that our stockholders may consider favorable. In addition, if the share purchase rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement are exercised, it could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur stock price has been and may in the future be volatile, which could cause holders of our common stock to incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has been and in the future may be subject to substantial price volatility. The stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, our stockholders could incur substantial losses. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of potential milestone payments that we may receive from Ipsen, Servier and/or Elevation;\n\u2022\npublic disclosures by Ibsen and Elevation of the status and results of their clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials of competitors to Ibsen and Elevation;\n\u2022\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022\nactivism by any single large stockholder or combination of stockholders;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions; and\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying regular cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be the sole source of gain for holders of our common stock.\nWe have not historically declared or paid regular cash dividends on our common stock. Although our board of directors declared special cash dividends of $6.7 million, $20.0 million and $140.0 million, which were payable on December 23, 2019, September 5, 2019 and May 26, 2017, respectively, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 16, 2019, August 28, 2019 and May 17, 2017, respectively, we do not currently intend to pay any regular cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may in the future preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock, including by us or our directors, or shares issued upon the exercise of currently outstanding options could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nA substantial portion of our outstanding common stock can be traded without restriction at any time. In addition, a portion of our outstanding common stock is currently restricted as a result of federal securities laws, but can be sold at any time subject to applicable volume limitations. As such, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, by us or others, could reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, we have a significant number of shares that are subject to outstanding options. The exercise of these options and the subsequent sale of the underlying common stock could cause a further decline in our stock price.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may delay or otherwise adversely impact our ability to realize potential milestone payments from the Ipsen sale and the Elevation sale and create other additional risks which could have material and adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the ongoing coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic will have on our financial condition due to numerous factors that are not within our control, including the duration and severity of the outbreak. Specifically, stay-at-home orders, business closures, travel restrictions, supply chain disruptions and employee and clinical trial participant illness or quarantines could result in disruptions to Ipsen and Elevation\u2019s ability to conduct research, preclinical, clinical and/or regulatory activities that are required to trigger potential milestone payments to us. If these activities are significantly delayed,\nthe attainment of any milestone payments we might receive would also likely be delayed. The COVID-19 pandemic may also significantly affect our ability to sell any remaining preclinical assets due to the inability of potential partners to obtain capital or otherwise complete a transaction. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in ongoing volatility in financial markets. If our access to capital is restricted or associated borrowing costs increase as a result of developments in financial markets relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, our financial condition could be adversely impacted if we seek to raise equity and/or debt financing. At this time, we do not believe that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a significant impact on our current day-to-day operations or our near-term financial condition.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d sections.", "PERMNO": 13325, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "MACK"}
