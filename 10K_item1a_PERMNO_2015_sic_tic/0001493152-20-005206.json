{"cik": "1591890", "company": "1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe have had limited business operations since the closing of the Asset Sale.\nSince the closing of the Asset Sale, we are no longer engaged in the retail insurance and claims adjustment businesses and have had limited business operations as we evaluate the alternatives for the use of proceeds from the Asset Sale and evaluate our business strategy going forward. Our revenue has also been reduced, as we have limited assets with which to generate revenue. Our failure to secure additional sources of revenue may have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the uncertainty surrounding our future operations and business prospects may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common stock.\nAs a result of the Asset Sale, we are a very small public company with a large cash balance relative to our market capitalization.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $28.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $33.5 million in investments. We expect to invest significant funds into the implementation of our new business strategy, which will increase our operating expenses. Until we secure additional revenue streams, we may lose a significant amount of cash, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by financial market performance, general economic conditions, and other factors that may result in the recognition of other-than-temporary impairments. Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio and may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe also remain subject to the listing standards of Nasdaq and SEC rules and regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and have an obligation to continue to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of the Exchange Act even though compliance with these reporting requirements is economically burdensome. Unless we decide to deregister our shares and suspend our periodic reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, we will continue to incur ongoing operating expenses related to our status as a reporting issuer. While all public companies face the costs and burdens associated with being publicly traded, given our limited business operations, the costs and burdens of being a public company may be material.\nThe uncertainty regarding the use of proceeds from the Asset Sale and our future operations may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common stock.\nOur Board continues to evaluate various alternatives for the use of proceeds from the Asset Sale as it considers and finalizes our business strategy going forward. Our Board has broad discretion in finalizing the use of proceeds, which our investors may not agree with. This uncertainty may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common stock.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nUnfavorable global economic conditions, including as a result of health and safety concerns, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations and the implementation of our new business strategy could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy, including conditions that are outside of our control, such as the impact of health and safety concerns from the current outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus. The most recent global financial crisis caused by the coronavirus resulted in extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business and could delay the implementation of our new business strategy.\nAdditionally, adverse events such as health-related concerns about working in our offices, the inability to travel and other matters affecting the general work environment could harm our business and our business strategy. While we do not anticipate any material impact to our business operations as a result of the coronavirus, in the event of a major disruption caused by the outbreak of pandemic diseases such as coronavirus, we may lose the services of our employees or experience system interruptions, which could lead to diminishment of our business operations. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and delay the implementation of our business strategy and we cannot anticipate all the ways in which the current global health crisis and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nManagement is actively monitoring the global situation on its financial condition, liquidity, operations, industry and workforce. Given the daily evolution of the coronavirus and the global responses to curb its spread, the Company is not able to estimate the effects of the coronavirus on its results of operations, financial condition or liquidity for fiscal year 2020.\nWe are subject to non-competition and non-solicitation covenants under the Purchase Agreement, which may limit our operations in certain respects.\nWe are subject to the non-competition and non-solicitation covenants in the Purchase Agreement until December 2, 2024. During this period of time, subject to certain exceptions, we will generally be prohibited from (i) marketing, selling and issuing residential property and casualty insurance policies to residential consumers anywhere in the States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina and Texas (a \u201cRestricted Business\u201d), and owning the equity securities of, managing, operating or controlling any person that engages in a Restricted Business, (ii) hiring or soliciting certain employees of FedNat or the companies sold under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, and (iii) soliciting or accepting business from certain third parties on any customer, agent or vendor list of Maison, MMI, or ClaimCor in connection with a Restricted Business. The non-competition covenant does not apply to our reinsurance business, and we will be permitted to enter into reinsurance contracts in the States of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina and Texas.\nThe limitations set forth in the non-competition and non-solicitation covenants may negatively impact the scope of our future operations, limit our recruitment of key employees, restrict our ability to enter into strategic relationships, and impair our ability to pursue certain business alternatives, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.\nWe do not have an operating history or established reputation in the reinsurance industry, and our lack of an established operating history and reputation may make it difficult for us to attract or retain business.\nAs part of our business going forward, we plan to provide specialty property and casualty reinsurance through PIH Re, Ltd., our reinsurance subsidiary domiciled under the laws of Bermuda, and Fundamental Global Reinsurance Ltd., a reinsurance subsidiary we are in the process of forming under the laws of the Cayman Islands. We will not have an operating history on which we can base an estimate of our future earnings prospects. We also do not have an established reputation in the reinsurance industry. Reputation is a very important factor in the reinsurance industry, and competition for business is, in part, based on reputation. Although we expect that our reinsurance policies will be fully collateralized, we will be a relatively newly formed reinsurance company and do not yet have a well-established reputation in the reinsurance industry. Our lack of an established reputation may make it difficult for us to attract or retain business. We will compete with major reinsurers, all of which have substantially greater financial marketing and management resources than we do, which may make it difficult for us to effectively market our products or offer our products at a profit. In addition, we do not have or currently intend to obtain financial strength ratings, which may discourage certain counterparties from entering into reinsurance contracts with us.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nOur failure to obtain or maintain approval of insurance regulators and other regulatory authorities as required for the operations of our reinsurance subsidiary may have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur reinsurance subsidiary, PIH Re, Ltd., as a Bermuda domiciled entity, is required to maintain licenses. PIH Re, Ltd. is registered as a reinsurer only in Bermuda. Bermuda insurance statutes and regulations and policies of the Bermuda Monetary Authority, or \u201cBMA,\u201d require that PIH Re, Ltd., among other things, maintain a minimum level of capital and surplus, satisfy solvency standards, restrict dividends and distributions, obtain prior approval or provide notification to the BMA of certain transactions, maintain a head office, and have certain officers and a director resident in Bermuda, appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda and provide for the performance of certain periodic examinations of itself and its financial conditions. A failure to meet these conditions may result in the suspension or revocation of its license to do business as a reinsurance company in Bermuda, which would mean that PIH Re, Ltd. would not be able to enter into any new reinsurance contracts until the suspension ended or it became licensed in another jurisdiction. For any or a number of reasons, the BMA could revoke or suspend PIH Re, Ltd.\u2019s license. Any such suspension or revocation of its license would negatively impact its and our reputation in the reinsurance marketplace and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are also in the process of forming a new reinsurance subsidiary, Fundamental Global Reinsurance Ltd., to provide specialty property and casualty reinsurance. We expect that Fundamental Global Reinsurance Ltd. will have a Class B (iii) insurer license in accordance with the terms of The Insurance Law, 2010 and underlying regulations thereto, and will be subject to regulation by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority. Failure to comply with the laws, regulations and requirements applicable to a Cayman Islands-domiciled reinsurance subsidiary could result in consequences which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, other reinsurance subsidiaries we may form in other foreign jurisdictions will be subject to the requirements of those jurisdictions, and we may fail to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements.\nAs a reinsurer, we will depend on our clients\u2019 evaluations of the risks associated with their insurance underwriting, which may subject us to reinsurance losses.\nIn the proportional reinsurance business, in which we will assume an agreed percentage of each underlying insurance contract being reinsured, or quota share contracts, we do not plan to separately evaluate each of the original individual risks assumed under these reinsurance contracts. We will therefore be largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies, which will subject us to the risk that the clients may not have adequately evaluated the insured risks and that the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume. We also do not plan to separately evaluate each of the individual claims made on the underlying insurance contracts under quota share arrangements, in which case we will be dependent on the original claims decisions made by our clients.\nThe involvement of reinsurance brokers may subject us to their credit risk.\nAs a standard practice of the reinsurance industry, reinsurers frequently pay amounts owed on claims under their policies to reinsurance brokers, and these brokers, in turn, remit these amounts to the ceding companies that have reinsured a portion of their liabilities with the reinsurer. In some jurisdictions, if a broker fails to make such a payment, the reinsurer might remain liable to the client for the deficiency notwithstanding the broker\u2019s obligation to make such payment. Conversely, in certain jurisdictions, when the client pays premiums for policies to reinsurance brokers for payment to the reinsurer, these premiums are considered to have been paid and the client will no longer be liable to the reinsurer for these premiums, whether or not the reinsurer has actually received them from the broker. Consequently, as a reinsurer, we expect to assume a degree of credit risk associated with the brokers that we intend to do business with.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nWe may be unable to purchase retrocessional reinsurance for the liabilities we reinsure, and if we successfully purchase such retrocessional reinsurance, we may be unable to collect, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRetrocessional coverage (reinsurance for the liabilities we reinsure) may not always be available to us or may not always be available at acceptable terms. From time to time, as a reinsurer we expect that we will purchase retrocessional coverage for our own account in order to mitigate the effect of a potential concentration of losses upon our financial condition. The insolvency or inability or refusal of a retrocessional reinsurer to make payments under the terms of its agreement with us could have an adverse effect on us because we will remain primarily liable to our client. From time to time, market conditions have limited, and in some cases have prevented, reinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of retrocession that they consider adequate for their business needs. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain our desired amounts of retrocessional coverage or negotiate terms that we deem appropriate or acceptable or obtain retrocession from entities with satisfactory creditworthiness. Our failure to establish adequate retrocessional arrangements or the failure of our retrocessional arrangements to protect us from overly concentrated risk exposure could significantly and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in carrying out our investment and investment management strategy, and fair value of our investments will be subject to a loss in value.\nWe have formed an investment advisory firm subsidiary, Fundamental Global Advisors LLC (the \u201cAdvisor\u201d) which uses an affiliated investment advisor registered with the SEC, to carry out our investment advisory services. We also intend to form a joint venture with Fundamental Global Investors, LLC to sponsor investment advisors that we anticipate will manage private funds ranging the full spectrum of alternative equities, fixed income, private equity and real estate. In exchange for seeding the new funds, we expect to receive a special interest in each new fund (or its general partner). Since we plan to conduct our investment activities through private funds, our contributions made to those funds may be subject to lock-up agreements and our ability to access this capital may be limited for a defined period, which may increase a risk of loss of all or a significant portion of value. Our investments may also become concentrated. A significant decline in the major values of these investments may produce a large decrease in our consolidated shareholders\u2019 equity and can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated book value per share and earnings.\nAs discussed above under Item 1. \u201cBusiness,\u201d in connection with the Asset Sale, the Advisor and FedNat have entered into an investment advisory agreement in which the Advisor has agreed to provide investment advisory services to FedNat, including identifying, analyzing and recommending potential investments, advising as to existing investments and investment optimization, recommending investment dispositions, and providing advice regarding macro-economic conditions. Any fees received for such services may not be commensurate with the services provided. We also may not be able to enter into such advisory management agreements with other entities on favorable terms, or at all. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs part of our business going forward, we also plan to purchase controlling interests in income producing real estate assets, and will seek to benefit from underlying rental income on long-term leases with high quality tenants as well as the capital appreciation from the underlying real estate assets. Investments in real estate assets are subject to varying degrees of risk. For example, an investment in real estate cannot generally be quickly converted to cash, limiting our ability to promptly vary our portfolio in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions. Investments in real estate assets are also subject to adverse changes in general economic conditions which may reduce the demand for rental space. Moreover, we may not be able to acquire quality, income producing real estate assets or attract high-quality tenants on favorable terms, if at all. We also expect to compete with numerous other persons or entities seeking to buy real estate assets, including real estate investment trusts or other real estate operating companies with greater experience and financial strength. Any of these factors could impact our real estate investment strategy and have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe will be subject to the risk of possibly becoming an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nWe will be subject to the risk of inadvertently becoming an investment company, which would require us to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). Registered investment companies are subject to extensive, restrictive and potentially adverse regulations relating to, among other things, operating methods, management, capital structure, dividends and transactions with affiliates. Registered investment companies are not permitted to operate their business in the manner in which we currently operate and plan to operate our business in the future.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nWe plan to monitor the value of our investments and structure our operations and transactions to qualify for exemptions under the Investment Company Act. Accordingly, we may structure transactions in a less advantageous manner than if we did not have Investment Company Act concerns, or we may avoid otherwise economically desirable transactions due to those concerns. In addition, adverse developments with respect to our ownership of our operating subsidiaries, including significant appreciation or depreciation in the market value of certain of our publicly traded holdings, could result in our inadvertently becoming an investment company. If it were established that we were an investment company, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that we could become subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, in an action brought by the SEC, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with us undertaken during the period it was established that we were an unregistered investment company.\nOur results of operations will fluctuate from period to period and may not be indicative of our long-term prospects.\nWe anticipate that the performance of our reinsurance operations and our future investment and real estate portfolios will fluctuate from period to period. In addition, because we plan to underwrite products and make investments to achieve favorable return on equity over the long-term, our short-term results of operations may not be indicative of our long-term prospects. Our results of operations may also be adversely impacted by general economic conditions and the conditions and outlook of the reinsurance markets and capital markets.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key personnel and management, which could adversely impact our ability to successfully implement and execute our business and growth strategy.\nThe successful implementation of our business and growth strategy depends in large part upon the ability and experience of members of our management and other personnel. We experienced a number of personnel changes in connection with the closing of our Asset Sale, including the resignations of Douglas N. Raucy, who served as our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Dean E. Stroud, who served as our Vice President and Chief Underwriting Officer. We currently do not have a Chief Executive Officer, which may be looked upon unfavorably by our investors and could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe currently have two employees, John S. Hill, who serves as out Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Brian D. Bottjer, who serves as our Senior Vice President and Controller. Our performance will be dependent on our ability to identify, hire, train, motivate and retain qualified management and personnel with experience in the reinsurance industry, investment advisory services, and in real estate investments. We may not be able to attract and retain such personnel on acceptable terms, or at all. If we lose the service of qualified management or other personnel or are unable to attract and retain the necessary members of management or personnel, we may not be able to successfully execute on our business strategy, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur information technology systems may fail or suffer a loss of security which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our computer and data processing systems. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to process our business timely and efficiently and protect our information systems from physical loss or unauthorized access. In the event that our systems cannot be accessed due to a natural catastrophe, terrorist attack or power outage, or systems and telecommunications failures or outages, external attacks such as computer viruses, malware or cyber-attacks, or other disruptions occur, our ability to perform business operations on a timely basis could be significantly impaired and may cause our systems to be inaccessible for an extended period of time. A sustained business interruption or system failure could adversely impact our ability to perform necessary business operations in a timely manner, hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers and have a material adverse effect our financial condition and results of operations.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nOur operations also depend on the reliable and secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. From time to time, we may experience threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions. Computer viruses, hackers, phishing attacks, social engineering schemes, ransomware, employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches, cyber-attacks or other disruptions. In addition, we routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by electronic means. Our systems and networks may be subject to breaches or interference. Any such event may result in operational disruptions as well as unauthorized access to or the disclosure or loss of our proprietary information or our customers\u2019 information or theft of funds and other monetary loss, which in turn may result in legal claims, regulatory scrutiny and liability, damage to our reputation, the incurrence of costs to eliminate or mitigate further exposure, the loss of customers or affiliated advisers or other damage to our business.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of integrated internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal controls and attestations of the effectiveness of internal controls by independent auditors. We currently qualify as a smaller reporting company under the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d). Under new rules recently adopted by the SEC, as a smaller reporting company we are exempt from the requirement to include the auditor\u2019s report of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting until such time as we no longer qualify as a smaller reporting company based on our public float and report more than $100 million in annual revenues in a fiscal year. Regardless of our qualification status, we have implemented substantial control systems and procedures in order to satisfy the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act and applicable requirements of Nasdaq, among other items. Maintaining these internal controls is costly and may divert management\u2019s attention.\nOur evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting may identify material weaknesses that may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC, or violations of Nasdaq\u2019s listing rules. There also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also could suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. This may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could also lead to a decline in the price of our common stock.\nWhile we currently qualify as a smaller reporting company under SEC regulations, we cannot be certain if we take advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to these companies that we will not make our common stock less attractive to investors. Once we lose smaller reporting company status, the costs and demands placed upon our management are expected to increase.\nThe SEC\u2019s rules permit smaller reporting companies like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not smaller reporting companies. As long as we qualify as a smaller reporting company, based on our public float, and report less than $100 million in annual revenues in a fiscal year we are permitted, and we intend to, omit the auditor\u2019s attestation on internal control over financial reporting that would otherwise be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nWe lost our status as an emerging growth company as of December 31, 2019. While we expect to remain a smaller reporting company and non-accelerated filer, we now face increased disclosure requirements as a non-emerging growth company, such as stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation (\u201csay-on-pay\u201d). Until such time that we lose smaller reporting company status, it is unclear if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on certain disclosure exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile and could cause our stock price to decline. As a result of the loss of our emerging growth company status, we expect the costs and demands placed upon our management to increase, as we now have to comply with additional disclosure and accounting requirements. In addition, even if we remain a smaller reporting company, if our public float exceeds $75 million and we report $100 million or more in annual revenues in a fiscal year, we will become subject to the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring an independent registered public accounting firm to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, making the public reporting process more costly.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nWe have directors who also serve as directors and/or executive officers for other public companies or for our controlling stockholders or their affiliates, which may lead to conflicting interests.\nWe have directors who serve as executive officers and/or directors of FGI and its affiliates, which together, as of December 31, 2019, beneficially owned approximately 45% of our outstanding shares of common stock. In addition, FGI and its affiliates beneficially own 4.9% of our outstanding shares of 8.00% cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A. In addition, one of our directors serves as an executive officer and director of Atlas Financial Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFH) (\u201cAtlas\u201d), a specialty commercial automobile insurance company. Another of our directors also currently serves as director of Limbach Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: LMB) (\u201cLimbach\u201d), an affiliate of KFSI (which, together with its affiliates, holds a warrant exercisable for common shares representing 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock).\nOur executive officers and members of our Company\u2019s Board of Directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders; likewise, persons who serve in similar capacities at Atlas, Limbach and FGI have fiduciary duties to those companies\u2019 investors. We may find, though, the potential for a conflict of interest if our Company and one or more of these other companies pursue acquisitions, investments and other business opportunities that may be suitable for each of us. Our directors who find themselves in these multiple roles may, as a result, have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. Furthermore, our directors who find themselves in these multiple roles own stock options, shares of common stock and other securities in some of these entities. These ownership interests could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the applicable individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our Company and these other entities. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with or participate jointly in investments with Atlas, Limbach or FGI or its affiliates. We may create new situations in the future in which our directors serve as directors or executive officers in future investment holdings of such entities.\nWe have a limited operating history as a publicly-traded company. Our inexperience as a public company and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention, affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members and have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.\nWe have a limited operating history as a publicly-traded company. As a publicly-traded company, we are required to develop and implement substantial control systems, policies and procedures in order to satisfy our periodic SEC reporting and Nasdaq obligations. Management\u2019s past experience may not be sufficient to successfully develop and implement these systems, policies and procedures and to operate our company. Failure to do so could jeopardize our status as a public company, and the loss of such status may have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders.\nIn addition, as a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and Nasdaq rules, including those promulgated in response to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The requirements of these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, we need to continually commit significant resources, maintain staff and provide additional management oversight. In addition, implementing our new business strategy and sustaining our growth will require us to commit additional management, operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join our organization and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion. These activities may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nAs a public company, we incur significant annual expenses related to these steps associated with, among other things, director fees, reporting requirements, transfer agent fees, accounting, legal and administrative personnel, auditing and legal fees and similar expenses. We also incur higher costs for director and officer liability insurance. Any of these factors make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors. Finally, we expect to incur additional costs once we lose smaller reporting company status or are required to provide an auditor attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nHolders of our outstanding shares of 8.00% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, have dividend, liquidation and other rights that are senior to the rights of the holders of our common shares.\nAs of March 27, 2020, we have issued and outstanding 700,000 shares of preferred stock designated as 8.00% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $25.00 per share (the \u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d). The aggregate liquidation preference with respect to the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock is approximately $17.5 million, and annual dividends on the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are $1.4 million. Holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors of the Company or a duly authorized committee thereof, out of lawfully available funds for the payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends from and including the original issue date at the rate of 8.00% of the $25.00 per share liquidation preference per annum (equivalent to $2.00 per annum per share). Upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, before any payment is made to holders of our common shares, holders of these preferred shares are entitled to receive a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the date of payment. This would reduce the remaining amount of our assets, if any, available to distribute to holders of our common shares.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to designate and issue additional preferred shares with liquidation, dividend and other rights that are senior to those of our common shares similar to the rights of the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock. Because our decision to issue additional securities will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities issuances reducing the market price of our common shares and diluting their interests.\nThe shares of FedNat common stock we have received as part of the consideration for the Asset Sale are subject to certain limitations and restrictions.\nThe shares of FedNat common stock we have received in the Asset Sale were issued pursuant to the terms of a Standstill Agreement entered into between the Company and FedNat upon the closing of the Asset Sale. The Standstill Agreement imposes certain limitations and restrictions with respect to our ownership of FedNat common stock, including, among other things, requiring us to vote all of the voting securities of FedNat we own in accordance with the recommendation of FedNat\u2019s board of directors and prohibiting us from publicly advising or influencing any person with respect to the voting of any shares of FedNat common stock and taking any action to nominate any person for election to FedNat\u2019s board of directors. Our status as a minority stockholder of FedNat as well as the limitations and restrictions expected to be set forth in the Standstill Agreement may limit our ability to exert significant influence on FedNat\u2019s management and operations and matters requiring approval of FedNat\u2019s stockholders. FedNat\u2019s management and holders of a larger percentage of FedNat\u2019s common stock may also take or encourage actions that decrease the value of our shares of FedNat common stock or are not in our best interests as a minority stockholder.\nWe may fail to satisfy the continued listing standards of Nasdaq and may have to delist our common shares.\nEven though we currently satisfy the continued listing standards for Nasdaq and expect to continue to do so, we can provide no assurance that we will continue to satisfy the continued listing standards in the future. In the event that we are unable to satisfy the continued listing standards of Nasdaq, our common shares may be delisted from that market. Any delisting of our common shares from Nasdaq could:\nPROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\n\u25cf adversely affect our ability to attract new investors;\n\u25cf decrease the liquidity of our outstanding common shares;\n\u25cf reduce our flexibility to raise additional capital;\n\u25cf reduce the price at which our common shares trade; and\n\u25cf increase the transaction costs inherent in trading such common shares with overall negative effects for our stockholders.\nIn addition, delisting of our common shares could deter broker-dealers from making a market in or otherwise seeking or generating interest in our common shares, and might deter certain institutions and persons from investing in our securities at all. For these reasons and others, delisting could adversely affect the price of our common shares and our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 14607, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "PIH"}
