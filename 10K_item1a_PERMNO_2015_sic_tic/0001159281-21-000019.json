{"cik": "1159281", "company": "FIVE STAR SENIOR LIVING INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe Pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a materially adverse effect on our business, operations, financial results and liquidity and its duration is unknown.\nThe Pandemic has had a negative impact on the global economy, including certain industries in the U.S. economy that are primarily focused on personal services.\nThese conditions have had, and will likely continue to have, a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations and liquidity. Occupancy at our senior living communities has continually declined during the Pandemic and we expect these declines may continue for a sustained period of time, which we expect would have a significant adverse impact on our financial results. Although the rates we charge residents has not changed significantly to date as a result of the Pandemic, that could change if the Pandemic continues or economic conditions worsen. We earn management fees based on a percentage of revenues generated at the senior living communities that we manage; therefore, declines in occupancy, restrictions on admitting new residents and the closure or curtailment of operations of senior living communities we manage, without sufficient offsets from increased rates or other revenues, and vice versa, have and likely will continue to reduce the management fees we earn. In addition, the Pandemic may further adversely impact our business if shortages in the materials we need to operate our senior living communities or staffing shortages result. Additionally, the Pandemic could continue to significantly increase certain operating costs for our senior living communities, including labor costs due to agency usage or overtime pay and our costs to obtain PPE, to incorporate enhanced infection control measures and to implement quarantines for residents. Also, we believe that our insurance costs may continue to rise as a result of claims or litigation associated with the Pandemic. In addition, as a result of the Pandemic, Ageility has been forced to close certain outpatient clinics temporarily and we significantly reduced the number of new clinics we planned to open during 2020. As a result, revenues from our Ageility business have been, and may continue to be, negatively impacted.\nAlthough immunization against COVID-19 is in process, it is expected to continue through the first quarter of 2021, and with considerable effort and expense, for all of the residents and team members in our senior living communities to be vaccinated and even longer for the vaccines to be produced, distributed and administered to a sufficient number of people to\nenable the cessation of the Pandemic. In addition, we may be subject to claims by residents and team members related to vaccine administration by us or the care provided by us following administration of the vaccine and we cannot be sure we will be protected from liability as a result of being a \"Covered Person\" under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act.\nWe cannot predict the extent and duration of the Pandemic or its economic impact, but we expect the adverse consequences will be substantial. Further, the extent and strength of any economic recovery after the Pandemic abates is uncertain and subject to various factors and conditions. Our business, operations and financial position may continue to be negatively impacted after the Pandemic abates and may remain at depressed levels compared to prior to the outbreak of the Pandemic for an extended period.\nThe high levels of infected COVID-19 patients and deaths at senior living communities and resulting negative publicity may have a long-term significant detrimental impact on the senior living industry.\nCOVID-19 has been particularly harmful to seniors and persons with pre-existing health conditions. If the senior living industry continues to experience high levels of COVID-19 infections among residents and related deaths, and news accounts emphasize these experiences, seniors may delay or forgo moving into senior living communities or using other services provided by senior living operators. As a result, our senior living communities\u2019 business and our results of operations may experience a long-term significant detrimental impact.\nWe may fail to operate profitably and grow our revenues.\nMost of the senior living communities we manage are owned by DHC and we operate those senior living communities pursuant to the New Management Agreements that became effective following the Restructuring Transactions. Pursuant to these New Management Agreements, DHC funds the operations and capital needs of those senior living communities, which alleviates us of those funding commitments. In return, we earn base management fees and construction supervision fees based on a fixed percentage of revenues and construction costs for construction projects we manage at those senior living communities. As a result, our ability to grow our revenues from managing those senior living communities will be limited to the applicable fee percentages related to the growth of revenues or applicable construction costs from those senior living communities, subject to any incentive fees we may earn. In addition, some of our costs are fixed or cannot be, or may be delayed in being, proportionally adjusted in response to any decline in fees and other revenues we may experience. As a result, a small percentage decline in our revenues or increase in our expenses could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nIn addition to managing senior living communities for DHC, we own senior living communities outright and lease senior living communities from another owner of senior living communities, as well as providing other services, such as rehabilitation, wellness and home health services. We may grow these businesses or engage in new or additional businesses in the future. If we do not profitably operate our businesses, the losses we may incur from these businesses, together with corporate and general and administrative expenses we may incur, may exceed the fees we earn from managing senior living communities for DHC and we may incur operating losses as a result.\nTermination of assisted living resident agreements and resident attrition could adversely affect our revenues and earnings.\nUnlike typical apartment leases that typically have a one-year term, state regulations governing assisted living communities typically require that senior living community residents have the right to terminate their assisted living resident agreements for any reason on reasonable (30 to 60 days\u2019) notice. Should a large number of our residents elect to terminate their resident agreements at or around the same time, our revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the advanced ages of our senior living residents may result in high resident turnover rates.\nCurrent and future trends in healthcare and the needs and preferences of older adults could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe healthcare industry is dynamic. The needs and preferences of older adults have generally changed over the past several years, including preferences for older adults to reside in their homes permanently or to delay moving to senior living communities until they require greater care. Further, rehabilitation services and other services are increasingly available and being provided to older adults on an outpatient basis or in older adults\u2019 personal residences, which may cause older adults to delay moving to senior living communities. Such delays may result in decreases in our occupancy rates and increases in our resident turnover rates. Moreover, older adults who do eventually move to senior living communities may have greater care needs and acuity, which may increase our cost of doing business, expose us to additional liability or result in lost business and shorter stays at our senior living communities. These trends may negatively impact our occupancy rates, revenues, cash flows and results of operations.\nAdditionally, if we fail to identify and successfully act upon future changes and trends in healthcare and the needs and preferences of older adults, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be adversely impacted.\nCircumstances that adversely affect the ability of older adults or their families to pay for our services could cause our revenues and results of operations to decline.\nBecause government benefits, such as Medicare and Medicaid, are not generally available for services at independent and assisted living communities, our residents paid from their private resources approximately 86.3% of the total resident fees in connection with the senior living communities we operated during the year ended December 31, 2020, and we expect to continue to rely on our residents\u2019 ability to pay for our services from their private resources. Economic downturns, lower levels of consumer confidence, stock market volatility and/or changes in demographics could adversely affect the ability of older adults to afford our resident fees. Our prospective residents frequently use the proceeds from their home sales to pay our entrance and resident fees. Downturns or stagnation in the U.S. housing market could adversely affect the ability, or perceived ability of older adults to afford these fees. Also, recent high unemployment as a result of the Pandemic may reduce the ability of family members to assist their older relatives in paying these fees. If we are unable to retain and/or attract older adults with sufficient income, assets or other resources required to pay the fees associated with independent and assisted living services and other service offerings, our revenues and results of operations could decline.\nWe face significant competition.\nWe compete with numerous other senior living community operators, as well as companies that provide senior living services, such as home healthcare companies and other real estate based service providers. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than us and some are not for profit entities that have endowment income and may not face the same financial pressures that we do. We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract a sufficient number of residents to our senior living communities at rates that will generate acceptable returns or that we will be able to attract team members and keep wages and other employee benefits, insurance costs and other operating expenses at levels that will allow us to compete successfully and operate profitably.\nIn recent years, a significant number of new senior living communities have been developed. Although there are indications that the rate of newly started developments has recently declined and further slowed due to the Pandemic, new inventory is expected to still hit the market in the near term due to the increased development of senior living communities in the past several years, and this increased supply of senior living communities has increased and will continue to increase competitive pressures on us, particularly in certain geographic markets where we operate senior living communities, and we expect these competitive challenges to continue for the foreseeable future. These competitive challenges may prevent us from maintaining or improving occupancy and rates at our senior living communities, which may adversely affect their profitability and, therefore, negatively impact our revenues, cash flows and results from operations.\nChanges in the reimbursement rates, methods, or timing of payment from government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or other reductions in reimbursement for senior living and healthcare services could adversely impact our revenues.\nOur revenues rely in part on reimbursement from government programs and third party payers for the senior living and rehabilitation services we provide. The healthcare industry in the United States is subject to continuous reform efforts and pressures to reduce costs. Some of our operations, especially the SNFs we manage on behalf of DHC and our Ageility business, receive significant revenues from Medicare and Medicaid. The rates and amounts of payments under these programs are subject to periodic adjustment and there have been numerous recent legislative and regulatory actions or proposed actions with respect to Medicare and Medicaid payments, insurance and healthcare delivery. Additionally, we receive significant payments from third party payers for certain of our rehabilitation and wellness services, including approximately 50.6% and 44.1% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These private third party payers continue their efforts to control healthcare costs and decrease payments for our services through direct contracts with healthcare providers, increased utilization review practices and greater enrollment in managed care programs and preferred provider organizations. Any reduction in the payments we receive from Medicare, Medicaid and third party payers could result in the failure of those reimbursements to cover our costs of providing required services to our residents and clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in our labor costs and staffing turnover may have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe success of our senior living communities depends on our ability to attract and retain team members for the day-to-day operations of those communities. We continue to face upward pressure on wages and benefits due to high competition for qualified personnel in our industry, low unemployment prior to the onset of the Pandemic and recent proposed and enacted legislation to increase the minimum wage in certain jurisdictions. The market for regional and executive directors at our\ncommunities, and qualified nurses, therapists and other healthcare professionals is highly competitive, and periodic or geographic area shortages of such healthcare professionals, as well as the added pressure of the Pandemic, may require us to increase the wages and benefits we offer to our team members in order to attract and retain them or to utilize temporary personnel at an increased cost. In addition, employee benefit costs, including health insurance and workers\u2019 compensation insurance costs, have materially increased in recent years.\nOur labor costs have increased because of the Pandemic, including because of increased staffing needs and team member exposure to COVID-19. Staffing turnover at our senior living communities is common and has increased as a result of the Pandemic, the current competitive labor market conditions and the competitive environment in the senior living industry. We have had to rely on more expensive agency help or pay overtime to adequately staff our communities and clinics. Labor unions also attempt to organize our team members from time to time; if our team members were to unionize, it could result in business interruptions, work stoppages, the degradation of service levels due to work rules, or increased operating expenses that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nAdditionally, our operations are subject to various employment related laws and regulations, which govern matters such as minimum wages, the Family and Medical Leave Act, overtime pay, compensable time, recordkeeping and other working conditions, and a variety of similar laws that govern these and other employment related matters. We are currently subject to employment related claims in connection with our operations. These claims, lawsuits and proceedings are in various stages of adjudication or investigation and involve a wide variety of claims and potential outcomes. Because labor represents a significant portion of our operating expenses, compliance with these evolving laws and regulations could substantially increase our cost of doing business, while failure to do so could subject us to significant back pay awards, fines and lawsuits and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny significant failure by us to control labor costs or to pass any increases on to residents through rate increases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, increased costs charged to our residents may reduce our occupancy and growth.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation, which requires us to incur significant costs and may result in losses.\nLicensing and Medicare and Medicaid laws require operators of senior living communities and rehabilitation and wellness clinics to comply with extensive standards governing operations and physical environments. Federal and state laws also prohibit fraud and abuse by senior living healthcare providers and rehabilitation and wellness clinic operators, including civil and criminal laws that prohibit false claims and regulate patient referrals in Medicare, Medicaid and other payer programs. In recent years, federal and state governments have devoted increased resources to monitoring the quality of care at senior living communities and to anti-fraud investigations in healthcare generally. CMS contractors, state Medicaid programs and other third-party payers continue to conduct medical necessity and compliance audits. When federal or state agencies identify violations of anti-fraud, false claims, anti-kickback and physician referral laws, they may impose or seek civil or criminal penalties, treble damages and other government sanctions, and may revoke a community\u2019s license or make conditional or exclude the community from Medicare or Medicaid participation. The ACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the FCA, making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers and for severe fines and penalties to be imposed. In addition, when these agencies determine that there has been quality of care deficiencies or improper billing, they may impose or seek various remedies or sanctions, including denial of new admissions, exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid program participation, monetary penalties, restitution of overpayments, government oversight, temporary management, loss of licensure and criminal penalties.\nCurrent state laws and regulations allow enforcement officials to make determinations as to whether the care provided at our senior living communities exceeds the level of care for which a particular community is licensed, which could result in holds on accepting new residents, or the closure of the facility and the immediate discharge and transfer of residents. Citations or revocation of a license or certification at one community could impact our ability to obtain new licenses or certifications or to maintain or renew existing licenses and certifications at other communities, and trigger defaults under our management agreements with DHC, our leases with PEAK and our credit agreement, adversely affect our ability to operate our senior living communities or our Ageility clinics or obtain financing in the future.\nOur senior living communities incur sanctions and penalties from time to time. As a result of the healthcare industry\u2019s extensive regulatory system and increasing enforcement initiatives, we have experienced increased costs for monitoring quality of care compliance, billing procedures and compliance with referral laws and other laws that apply to us, and we expect these costs may continue to increase.\nProvisions of the ACA could reduce our income and increase our costs.\nThe ACA regulates insurance, payment and healthcare delivery systems that have affected, and will continue to affect our revenues and costs. The ACA provides for multiple reductions to the annual market updates for inflation that may result in reductions in SNF Medicare payment rates. The ACA includes other provisions that may affect us, such as enforcement reforms and Medicare and Medicaid program integrity control initiatives, new compliance, ethics and public disclosure requirements, initiatives to encourage the development of home and community based long-term care services rather than institutional services under Medicaid, value based purchasing plans and a Medicare post-acute care pilot program to develop and evaluate making a bundled payment for services, including physician and SNF services, provided during an episode of care. We are unable to predict the impact on us of the insurance, payment, and healthcare delivery systems provisions contained in and to be developed pursuant to the ACA. In addition, maintaining compliance with the ACA requires us to expend management time and financial resources.\nOur business requires us to make significant capital expenditures to maintain and improve our senior living communities and to retain our competitive position in the senior living industry.\nOur senior living communities sometimes require significant expenditures to address required ongoing maintenance or to make them more attractive to residents. Various government authorities mandate certain physical characteristics of senior living communities; changes in these regulations may require us to make significant expenditures. In addition, we are often required to make significant capital expenditures when we acquire or newly lease senior living communities. Our available financial resources may be insufficient to fund these expenditures. We incur capital costs for senior living communities we own or lease and for our other businesses and corporate level activities. Further, increases in capital costs at our managed senior living communities may negatively impact the financial metrics at our senior living communities and our potential to earn incentive fees for these senior living communities or even give DHC a right to terminate the applicable management agreements. DHC\u2019s failure to make certain capital expenditures may result in our senior living communities being less competitive and in our earning less management fees.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to litigation and regulatory and government proceedings.\nWe have been, are currently, and expect in the future to be, involved in claims, lawsuits and regulatory and government audits, investigations and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, some of which may involve material amounts. The defense and resolution of such claims, lawsuits and other proceedings may require us to incur significant expenses.\nIn several well publicized instances, private litigation by residents of senior living communities for alleged abuses has resulted in large damage awards against other senior living companies. As a result, the cost of our liability insurance continues to increase. Medical liability insurance reforms have not generally been adopted, and we expect our insurance costs may continue to increase.\nLitigation may subject us to adverse rulings and judgments that may materially impact our business, operating results and liquidity. In addition, defending litigation distracts the attention of our management and may be expensive. For more information regarding certain of the settled employee litigation matters, our legal contingencies and past legal and compliance matters, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIf we do not achieve and maintain a high quality of care, payments through pay-for-performance and value-based purchasing programs may be reduced, and the overall attractiveness of our senior living communities to potential residents could decrease as more quality data becomes publicly available.\nCMS is moving toward pay-for-performance programs, such as value-based payment, as an alternative to fee-for-service reimbursement. In October 2016, CMS issued a final rule to implement the Quality Payment Program. Beginning in 2019, providers were subject to either MIPS payment adjustments or APM incentive payments. Under PAMA, since October 2018, Medicare payment rates are now partially based on SNFs\u2019 performance scores on a hospital readmission measure as part of CMS\u2019s new SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program. Under the IMPACT Act, SNFs are required to report certain quality measures, resource use measures and certain patient assessment data in a standardized and interoperable format. SNFs that fail to comply with the reporting requirements are subject to a 2% reduction in their Medicare payment rates. Since October 2018, HHS has made SNF-reported data publicly available on its Nursing Home Compare website. We cannot predict the impact of these quality-driven payment reforms, but they may be material to and adversely affect our future results of operations. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of more quality data becoming publicly available, but if we do not achieve and maintain a high quality of care, the overall attractiveness of our communities to potential residents could decrease.\nWe may fail to comply with the terms of our credit agreement.\nOur credit agreement includes various conditions, covenants and events of default. We may not be able to satisfy all of these conditions or may default on some of these covenants for various reasons, including for reasons beyond our control. For example, our credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial and other covenants. Our ability to comply with such covenants will depend upon our ability to operate our business profitably. If the recent trends in occupancy, rates and employment and other costs and expenses continue or increase, we may incur operating losses. Complying with these covenants may limit our ability to take actions that may be beneficial to us and our security holders.\nIf we default under our credit agreement, our lenders may demand immediate payment. Any default under our credit agreement that results in acceleration of our obligations to repay outstanding indebtedness would likely have serious adverse consequences to us, including the possible foreclosure of the real estate mortgages on 11 senior living communities owned by us, and would likely cause the value of our securities to decline.\nIn the future, we may obtain additional debt financing, and the covenants and conditions that apply to any such additional debt may be more restrictive than the covenants and conditions that are contained in our credit agreement.\nChanges in market interest rates may adversely affect us.\nInterest rates are at relatively low levels on a historical basis, and the U.S. Federal Reserve System has indicated that it does not expect to raise interest rates in response to the Pandemic and current market conditions until at least the end of 2023. There can be no assurance, however, that the U.S. Federal Reserve System will not raise rates prior to that time. Any increases in market interest rates may materially and negatively affect us in several ways, including:\n\u2022increases in interest rates could adversely impact the housing market and reduce demand for our services and occupancy at our senior living communities, which could reduce the likelihood that we will earn incentive fees at our managed senior living communities if the EBITDA we realize at our managed senior living communities declines as a result;\n\u2022amounts outstanding under our credit facility require interest to be paid at variable interest rates. When interest rates increase, our interest costs will increase, which could adversely affect our cash flows, our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt, our cost of refinancing our debt when it becomes due and our ability to fund our operations and working capital; and\n\u2022an increase in interest rates could negatively impact the market value of our owned senior living communities and limit our ability to sell any owned senior living communities. Increased interest rates would increase our costs for, and may limit our ability to obtain, mortgage financing.\nConversely, low market interest rates, particularly if they remain over a sustained period, may increase our use of debt capital to fund property acquisitions, lower capitalization rates for property purchases and increase competition for property purchases, which may reduce opportunities for us to operate additional communities.\nOur growth strategy may not succeed.\nWe intend to continue to grow our business by entering into additional long-term management arrangements for senior living communities and growing the ancillary services we provide in which residents\u2019 private resources account for all or a large majority of revenues. Our business plans include seeking to take advantage of expected long-term increases in demand for senior living communities and health and wellness services. Our growth strategy is subject to risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022we may not be an attractive business partner given our operating history and the liquidity challenges we have experienced;\n\u2022we may be unable to identify and acquire or newly manage or lease additional senior living communities and rehabilitation and wellness services clinics on acceptable terms;\n\u2022we may be unable to access the capital required to manage additional senior living communities and operate rehabilitation and wellness services clinics or grow ancillary services;\n\u2022we may not achieve the operating results we expect from senior living communities we operate or any rehabilitation and wellness or other services we may provide;\n\u2022it may take a period of time to stabilize the operations of senior living communities after we acquire, or commence managing or leasing, them;\n\u2022integrating the operations of newly managed senior living communities and rehabilitation and wellness services clinics we commence operating, or other rehabilitation and wellness services we may provide, may disrupt our existing operations, or may cost more than anticipated;\n\u2022we may fail to realize any expected operating or cost efficiencies from any future additional senior living communities or rehabilitation and wellness services clinics we operate;\n\u2022we may commence operating senior living communities that are subject to unknown liabilities and without any recourse, or with limited recourse, such as liability for the cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination or for claims by residents, vendors or other persons related to actions taken by former owners or operators of the communities;\n\u2022any failure to comply with licensing requirements at our senior living communities, rehabilitation and wellness services clinics or elsewhere may prevent our obtaining or renewing licenses needed to conduct and grow our businesses; and\n\u2022senior living communities and rehabilitation and wellness services clinics that we commence operating, and any new or expanded rehabilitation and wellness services we may seek to provide might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our other business activities.\nFor these reasons, among others, our growth strategy may not succeed or may cause us to experience losses.\nThe substantial majority of the senior living communities that we operate are owned by DHC and our business is substantially dependent on our relationship with DHC.\nOf the 252 senior living communities we operate, 228 are owned by DHC, and we manage all of those senior living communities pursuant to the New Management Agreements.\nDHC may terminate the New Management Agreements in certain circumstances, including if the EBITDA we generate at our managed senior living communities does not exceed target levels or for our uncured material breach. Our business is substantially dependent upon our continued relationship with DHC. The loss of the New Management Agreements with DHC, or a material change to their terms less favorable to us, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology and systems in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology or those systems could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe rely on information technology and systems, including the Internet and cloud-based infrastructures, commercially available software and our internally developed applications, to process, transmit, store and safeguard information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including managing our building systems, financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personally identifiable information or protected health information of team members and residents. If we or our third party vendors experience material security or other failures, inadequacies or interruptions, we could incur material costs and losses and our operations could be disrupted. We take various actions, and incur significant costs, to maintain and protect the operation and security of our information technology and systems, including the data maintained in those systems. However, these measures may not prevent the systems\u2019 improper functioning or a compromise in security.\nSecurity breaches, computer viruses, attacks by hackers, and online fraud schemes can create significant system disruptions, shutdowns, fraudulent transfer of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. The cybersecurity risks to us and our third-party vendors are heightened by, among other things, the evolving nature of the threats faced, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography and new and increasingly sophisticated methods used to perpetrate illegal or fraudulent activities against us, including cyberattacks, email or wire fraud and other attacks exploiting security vulnerabilities in our or third parties' information technology networks and systems or operations. Any failure by us or\nour third party vendors to maintain the security, proper function and availability of information technology and systems could result in financial losses, interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, cause us to be in default of material contracts and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and the value of our securities.\nWe may fail to comply with laws governing the privacy and security of personal information, including relating to health.\nWe are required to comply with federal and state laws governing the privacy, security, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information and protected health information, including HIPAA and the HITECH Act, as updated by the Omnibus Rule. If we fail to comply with applicable federal or state standards, we could be subject to civil sanctions and criminal penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInsurance may not adequately cover our losses, and the cost of obtaining such insurance may continue to increase.\nWe purchase certain third party insurance coverage for our business and properties, including for casualty, liability, malpractice, fire, extended coverage and rental or business interruption loss insurance. Pursuant to our management agreements with DHC, we are obligated to maintain certain insurance coverage for our DHC managed senior living communities. Recently, the costs of insurance have increased significantly, and these increased costs have had an adverse effect on us and the operating results for our senior living communities. Although DHC funds the insurance premiums for our DHC managed senior living communities, the increased costs of insurance may negatively impact the financial results at those managed senior living communities or give rise to a DHC right of termination of the applicable management agreements if the EBITDA at those managed senior living communities does not meet certain targets. In addition, we are responsible for paying for insurance for other properties that we operate, including senior living communities that we own or lease, and increased insurance costs will adversely impact us as a result. Losses of a catastrophic nature, such as those caused by hurricanes, flooding, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, or losses from terrorism, may be covered by insurance policies with limitations such as large deductibles or co-payments that we or the owner may not be able to pay. Insurance proceeds may not be adequate to restore an affected property to its condition prior to loss or to compensate us for our losses, including lost revenues or other costs. Certain losses, such as losses we may incur as a result of known or unknown environmental conditions, are not covered by our insurance. Market conditions or our loss history may limit the scope of insurance or coverage available to us on economic terms. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we may have to incur uninsured costs to mitigate such losses or lose all or a portion of the capital invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property.\nWe may incur significant costs from our self-insurance arrangements.\nWe self-insure up to certain limits for workers\u2019 compensation, professional and general liability and automobile coverage. Claims in excess of these limits are insured up to contractual limits, over which we are self-insured. We fully self-insure all health-related claims for our covered employees. We may incur significant costs for claims and related matters under our self-insurance arrangements. We cannot be sure that our insurance charges and self-insurance reserve requirements will not increase, and we cannot predict the amount of any such increase, or to what extent, if at all, we may be able to offset any such increase through higher retention amounts, self-insurance or other means in the future. Although we determine our employee health insurance, workers\u2019 compensation and professional and general liability self-insurance reserves with guidance from third party professionals, our reserves may nonetheless be inadequate. Determining reserves for the casualty, liability, workers\u2019 compensation and healthcare losses and costs that we have incurred as of the end of a reporting period involves significant judgments based upon our experience and our expectations of future events, including projected settlements for pending claims, known incidents that we expect may result in claims, estimates of incurred but not yet reported claims, expected changes in premiums for insurance provided by insurers whose policies provide for retroactive adjustments, estimated litigation costs and other factors. Since these reserves are based on estimates, the actual expenses we incur may differ from the amount reserved and could result in our recognizing a significant amount of expenses in excess of our reserves. Our costs under our self-insurance arrangements may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are subject to limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nOur ability to deduct pre-2020 net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards are subject to a significant annual limitation on account of the ownership changes resulting from the Restructuring Transactions, as described in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Losses and credits that arise after January 1, 2020, the effective date of the Restructuring Transactions, which currently are expected to be utilized to offset future taxable income, will not be subject to the limitations resulting from the Restructuring Transactions, but future changes in ownership may result in limitations on usage or elimination of those future losses and credits. Our bylaws contain provisions to facilitate the preservation of the tax treatment of our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards, including provisions generally prohibiting a person or group from becoming a \u201c5-percent shareholder\u201d (as defined in the applicable Treasury regulations) without the consent of our Board. However, we cannot be sure that these restrictions will be effective or\nthat our Board will not determine to waive such restrictions in the future. Moreover, net operating losses and other carryforwards are subject to other limitations under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the IRC, including provisions generally restricting carryforwards of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after 2017 from offsetting more than 80% of the current year\u2019s taxable income, which could affect our ability to utilize all of our existing net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in a given year.\nOur operations are subject to environmental risks and liabilities.\nWe are required to comply with various environmental laws governing the use, management and disposal of, and human exposure to, hazardous and toxic substances. If we fail to comply with such laws, or if the properties we own, operate or use for disposal are contaminated by such substances, we may be subject to penalties or other corrective action requirements and liabilities, including the costs to investigate or remediate such contamination. These laws also expose us to claims by third parties for costs and damages they may incur in connection with hazardous substances related to our activities and properties. If we experience these environmental liabilities and costs, they could have a material impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to risks from adverse weather and climate events.\nSevere weather may have an adverse effect on senior living communities we operate. Flooding caused by rising sea levels and severe weather events, including hurricanes, tornadoes and widespread fires have had and may have in the future an adverse effect on senior living communities we operate and result in significant losses to us and interruption of our business. When major weather or climate-related events occur near our senior living communities, we may relocate the residents of those senior living communities to alternative locations for their safety and close or limit the operations of the impacted senior living communities until the event has ended and the community is ready for operation. We may incur significant costs and losses as a result of these activities, both in terms of operating, preparing and repairing our senior living communities in anticipation of, during, and after a severe weather or climate-related event and in terms of potential lost business due to the interruption in operating our senior living communities. Our insurance may not adequately compensate us for these costs and losses.\nFurther, concerns about climate change have resulted in various treaties, laws and regulations that are intended to limit carbon emissions and address other environmental concerns. These and other laws may cause energy or other costs at our senior living communities to increase. In the long-term, we believe any such increased operating costs will be passed through and paid by our residents and other customers in the form of higher charges for our services. However, in the short-term, these increased costs, if material in amount, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and cause the value of our securities to decline.\nThe geographic concentration of our senior living communities exposes us to changes in market conditions in those areas.\nWe have a high concentration of senior living communities in certain geographic areas, including in Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Texas and Indiana. As a result of this concentration, the conditions of local economies and real estate markets, changes in governmental rules and regulations, acts of nature and other factors that may result in a decrease in demand for our services in these states could have an adverse effect on our revenues, results of operations and cash flow. In addition, we are particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increases or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes or tornadoes in those areas.\nWidespread illnesses due to a severe cold or flu season or a pandemic (like COVID-19) could adversely affect the occupancy of our senior living communities.\nOur revenues are dependent on occupancy at our senior living communities. If a severe cold or flu season, an epidemic or any other widespread illnesses, like COVID-19, were to occur in locations where our senior living communities are located, our revenues from those communities would likely be significantly adversely impacted. During such occasions, we may experience a decline in occupancy due to residents leaving our communities and, we may be required, or we may otherwise determine that it would be prudent, to quarantine some or all of the senior living community and not permit new residents during that time. Further, depending on the severity of the occurrence, we may be required to incur costs to identify, contain and remedy the impacts of those occurrences at those senior living communities. As a result, these occurrences could significantly adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe benefits we have realized and may continue to realize from participating in relief programs provided under the CARES Act may not be sufficient to enable us to withstand the current economic conditions and any extended economic downturn or recession which may result from the Pandemic.\nWe have received funds under the CARES Act, and have benefited from other relief measures pursuant to the CARES Act and other government stimulus, including the deferral of employer payroll taxes. Receipt of additional government funds and other benefits from the CARES Act is subject to, in certain circumstances, a detailed application and approval process and it is unclear whether we will meet any eligibility requirements, receive any funds and the extent to which these funds may offset our Pandemic-related cash flow disruptions. Additionally, retaining these funds subjects us to various terms and conditions. While we have taken steps to ensure compliance with these terms and conditions, any violation may trigger repayment of some or all of the funds received. Further, funds we have received or may receive, either directly through participation in government programs, or indirectly through increased revenues attributable to a possible economic recovery generated in whole or in part by the CARES Act, may not be sufficient to mitigate the impact of the Pandemic.\nRisks Arising From Certain of Our Relationships\nOur agreements and relationships with DHC, one of our Managing Directors, RMR LLC and others related to them may create conflicts of interest or the perception of such conflicts of interest.\nWe have significant commercial and other relationships with DHC, the Chair of our Board who is also one of our Managing Directors, Adam D. Portnoy, RMR LLC and others related to them, including:\n\u2022the substantial majority of the senior living communities that we operate are owned by DHC and our business is substantially dependent upon our relationship with DHC;\n\u2022DHC owned 33.7% of our outstanding common shares as of December 31, 2020;\n\u2022RMR LLC provides management services to us and DHC and we pay RMR LLC fees for those services based on a percentage of revenues, as defined under our business management agreement with RMR LLC. In the event of a conflict between us and DHC or us and RMR LLC, any of its affiliates or any public entity RMR LLC or its subsidiaries provide management services to, RMR LLC may not act on our behalf;\n\u2022Adam D. Portnoy, is also the chair of the board of trustees and a managing trustee of DHC, is a managing director, an officer and employee and, as the sole trustee of ABP Trust, the controlling shareholder of RMR Inc., and is an officer of, and through ABP Trust owns equity interests in, RMR LLC. RMR Inc. is the managing member of RMR LLC;\n\u2022Adam D. Portnoy beneficially owned, in aggregate, approximately 6.2% of our outstanding common shares and 1.1% of DHC's outstanding common shares, in each case as of December 31, 2020;\n\u2022our President and Chief Executive Officer, Katherine E. Potter, and our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, Jeffrey C. Leer, are also officers and employees of RMR LLC;\n\u2022our other Managing Director and Secretary, Jennifer B. Clark, is a managing trustee and secretary of DHC and a managing director and officer of RMR Inc. and an officer and employee of RMR LLC;\n\u2022our agreements with DHC and RMR LLC limit (subject to certain exceptions) ownership of more than 9.8% of our voting shares, restrict our ability to take any action that could jeopardize the tax status of DHC as a real estate investment trust and limit our ability to acquire real estate of types which are owned by DHC or other businesses managed by RMR LLC; and\n\u2022we lease our corporate headquarters building from a subsidiary of ABP Trust, the controlling shareholder of RMR Inc.\nThese multiple responsibilities, relationships and cross ownerships could create competition for the time and efforts of RMR LLC, our Managing Directors and other RMR LLC personnel, including our executive officers, and give rise to conflicts of interest, or the perception of such conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving us, RMR Inc., RMR LLC, our Managing Directors, the other companies to which RMR LLC or its subsidiaries provide management services and their related parties. Conflicts of interest or the perception of conflicts of interest could have a material adverse impact on our reputation,\nbusiness and the market price of our common shares and other securities and we may be subject to increased risk of litigation as a result.\nAs a result of these relationships, the New Management Agreements, business management agreement with RMR LLC and other transactions with DHC, our Managing Director, RMR LLC and others related to them were not negotiated on an arm\u2019s-length basis between unrelated third parties, and therefore, while certain of these agreements were negotiated with the use of a special committee and approved by our disinterested directors after receipt of a fairness opinion, the terms thereof may be different from those negotiated on an arm\u2019s-length basis between unrelated third parties. In the past, in particular, following periods of volatility in the overall market or declines in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, shareholder litigation, dissident shareholder director nominations and dissident shareholder proposals have often been instituted against companies alleging conflicts of interest, in business dealings with affiliated and related persons and entities. These activities, if instituted against us, and the existence of conflicts of interest or the perception of conflicts of interest could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and could have a material adverse impact on our reputation, business and the market price of our common shares.\nDHC owns 33.7% of our outstanding common shares. As a result, investors in our securities may have less influence over our business than shareholders of other publicly traded companies and trading in our shares may be difficult.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, DHC owns 33.7% of our outstanding common shares.\nFor so long as DHC retains a significant ownership stake in us, it will have a significant influence in the election of the members of our Board, including our Independent Directors, and the outcome of shareholder actions. As a result, DHC may have the ability to significantly impact all matters affecting us, including:\n\u2022the composition of our Board;\n\u2022determinations with respect to mergers and other business combinations; and\n\u2022the number of common shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plan.\nIn addition, the significant ownership of our common shares by DHC and Adam D. Portnoy and the entities controlled by him may discourage transactions involving a change of control of us, including transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their common shares over the then current market price.\nDHC's large shareholding also reduces the number of our common shares that might otherwise be available to trade publicly, which could adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our common shares.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nOwnership limitations and certain provisions in our charter, bylaws and certain material agreements, as well as certain provisions of Maryland law, may deter, delay or prevent a change in our control or unsolicited acquisition proposals.\nOur charter and bylaws contain separate provisions that prohibit any shareholder from owning more than 9.8% and 5% of the number or value of any class or series of our outstanding shares of stock, respectively. Our charter's 9.8% ownership limitation is consistent with our contractual obligation with DHC not to take actions that may conflict with DHC\u2019s status as a real estate investment trust under the IRC. The 5% ownership limitation in our bylaws is intended to help us preserve the tax treatment of any net operating losses and other tax benefits we may have from time to time. We also believe these provisions promote good orderly governance. These provisions inhibit acquisitions of a significant stake in us and may deter, delay or prevent a change in control of us or unsolicited acquisition proposals that a shareholder may consider favorable.\nOther provisions contained in our charter and bylaws or under Maryland law may also inhibit acquisitions of a significant stake in us and deter, delay or prevent a change in control of us or unsolicited acquisition proposals that a shareholder may consider favorable, including, for example, provisions relating to:\n\u2022the division of our Directors into three classes, with the term of one class expiring each year;\n\u2022shareholder voting rights and standards for the election of Directors and other provisions which require larger majorities for approval of actions which are not approved by our Board than for actions which are approved by our Board;\n\u2022the authority of our Board, and not our shareholders, to adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws and to fill vacancies on our Board;\n\u2022required qualifications for an individual to serve as a Director and a requirement that certain of our Directors be \u201cIndependent Directors\u201d and other Directors be \u201cManaging Directors\u201d, as defined in our bylaws;\n\u2022limitations on the ability of our shareholders to propose nominees for election as Directors and propose other business to be considered at a meeting of shareholders;\n\u2022certain procedural and informational requirements applicable to shareholders requesting that a special meeting be called;\n\u2022limitations on the ability of our shareholders to remove our Directors;\n\u2022the authority of our Board to create and issue new classes or series of shares (including shares with voting rights and other rights and privileges that may deter a change in control) and issue additional common shares;\n\u2022restrictions on business combinations between us and an interested shareholder that have not first been approved by our Board (including a majority of Directors not related to the interested shareholder); and\n\u2022the authority of our Board, without shareholder approval, to implement certain takeover defenses.\nAs changes occur in the marketplace for corporate governance policies, the above provisions may change or be removed, or new provisions may be added.\nOur management agreements with DHC provide that our rights under those agreements may be cancelled by DHC upon the acquisition by any person or group of more than 9.8% of our voting shares, and upon other change in control events, as defined in those documents, including the adoption of any proposal (other than a precatory proposal) or the election to our Board of any individual if such proposal or individual was not approved, nominated or appointed, as the case may be, by vote of a majority of our Directors in office immediately prior to the making of such proposal or the nomination or appointment of such individual. In addition, a change in control event of us, including upon the acquisition by any person or group of more than 35% of our voting shares, is a default under our credit agreement, unless approved by our lenders.\nOur rights and the rights of our shareholders to take action against our Directors and officers are limited.\nOur charter limits the liability of our Directors and officers to us and our shareholders for monetary damages to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law. Under current Maryland law, our Directors and officers will not have any liability to us and our shareholders for money damages other than liability resulting from:\n\u2022actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or\n\u2022active and deliberate dishonesty by such Director or officer that was established by a final judgment as being material to the cause of action adjudicated.\nOur charter and contractual obligations authorize and may require us to indemnify, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, any present or former Director or officer for actions taken by them in those and other capacities. In addition, we may be obligated to pay or reimburse the expenses incurred by our present and former Directors and officers without requiring a preliminary determination of their ultimate entitlement to indemnification. As a result, we and our shareholders may have more limited rights against our present and former Directors and officers than might otherwise exist absent the provisions in our charter and contracts or that might exist with other companies, which could limit our shareholders\u2019 recourse in the event of actions not in their best interest.\nShareholder litigation against us or our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees may be referred to mandatory arbitration proceedings, which follow different procedures than in-court litigation and may be more restrictive to shareholders asserting claims than in-court litigation.\nOur shareholders agree, by virtue of becoming shareholders, that they are bound by our governing documents, including the arbitration provisions of our bylaws, as they may be amended from time to time. Our bylaws provide that certain actions by one or more of our shareholders against us or any of our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees, other than disputes, or any portion thereof, regarding the meaning, interpretation or validity of any provision of our charter or\nbylaws, will be referred to mandatory, binding and final arbitration proceedings if we, or any other party to such dispute, including any of our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees, unilaterally so demands. As a result, we and our shareholders would not be able to pursue litigation in state or federal court against us or our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees, including, for example, claims alleging violations of federal securities laws or breach of fiduciary duties or similar director or officer duties under Maryland law, if we or any of our Directors, officers, manager, other parties or employees, against whom the claim is made unilaterally demands the matter be resolved by arbitration. Instead, our shareholders would be required to pursue such claims through binding and final arbitration.\nOur bylaws provide that such arbitration proceedings would be conducted in accordance with the procedures of the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as modified by our bylaws. These procedures may provide materially more limited rights to our shareholders than litigation in a federal or state court. For example, arbitration in accordance with these procedures does not include the opportunity for a jury trial, document discovery is limited, arbitration hearings generally are not open to the public, there are no witness depositions in advance of arbitration hearings and arbitrators may have different qualifications or experiences than judges. In addition, although our bylaws\u2019 arbitration provisions contemplate that arbitration may be brought in a representative capacity or on behalf of a class of our shareholders, the rules governing such representation or class arbitration may be different from, and less favorable to, shareholders than the rules governing representative or class action litigation in courts. Our bylaws also generally provide that each party to such an arbitration is required to bear their own costs in the arbitration, including attorneys\u2019 fees, and that the arbitrators may not render an award that includes shifting of such costs or, in a derivative or class proceeding, award any portion of our award to any shareholder or such shareholder\u2019s attorneys. The arbitration provisions of our bylaws may discourage our shareholders from bringing, and attorneys from agreeing to represent our shareholders wishing to bring, litigation against us or our Directors, officers, manager, other agents or employees. Our agreements with RMR LLC and DHC have similar arbitration provisions to those in our bylaws.\nWe believe that the arbitration provisions in our bylaws are enforceable under both state and federal law, including with respect to federal securities laws claims. We are a Maryland corporation and Maryland courts have upheld the enforceability of arbitration bylaws. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld agreements to arbitrate other federal statutory claims, including those that implicate important federal policies. However, some academics, legal practitioners and others are of the view that charter or bylaw provisions mandating arbitration are not enforceable with respect to federal securities laws claims. It is possible that the arbitration provisions of our bylaws may ultimately be determined to be unenforceable.\nBy agreeing to the arbitration provisions of our bylaws, shareholders will not be deemed to have waived compliance by us with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nOur bylaws designate the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland as the sole and exclusive forum for certain actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a judicial forum they deem favorable for disputes with us or our Directors, officers, manager, agents or employees.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless the dispute has been referred to binding arbitration, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland will be the sole and exclusive forum for: (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (2) any action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any Director, officer, manager, agent or employee of ours to us or our shareholders; (3) any action asserting a claim against us or any Director, officer, manager, agent or employee of ours arising pursuant to Maryland law, our charter or bylaws brought by or on behalf of a shareholder, either on his, her or its own behalf, on our behalf or on behalf of any series or class of shares of stock of ours or by shareholders against us or any Director, officer, agent, or employee of ours, or our manager, including any disputes, claims or controversies relating to the meaning, interpretation, effect, validity, performance or enforcement of the charter or bylaws; or (4) any action asserting a claim against us or any Director, officer, agent, employee, or manager of ours that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our bylaws also provide that the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland will be the sole and exclusive forum for any dispute, or portion thereof, regarding the meaning, interpretation or validity of any provision of our charter or bylaws. The exclusive forum provision of our bylaws does not apply to any action for which the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland does not have jurisdiction or to a dispute that has been referred to binding arbitration in accordance with our bylaws. The exclusive forum provision of our bylaws does not establish exclusive jurisdiction in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland for claims that arise under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws if there is exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction in the federal courts. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in our common shares shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions of our bylaws, as they may be amended from time to time. The arbitration and exclusive forum provisions of our bylaws may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the shareholder believes is favorable for disputes with us or our Directors, officers, agents, employees, or our manager, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our Directors, officers, agents, employees or our manager.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common shares in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common shares, and we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 89252, "SIC": 8051, "TIC": "FVE"}
