Some of these risk factors are described below. Any factor described in this Report on Form 10-K could, by itself or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to not be material also may materially and adversely affect us. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to other information disclosed in our SEC filings, including the financial statements and notes thereto.\nMARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISKS\nChallenging economic conditions or volatility in the financial markets could have a material adverse impact on our business, leading to diminished financial results and position.\nOur profitability depends to a large extent on IBERIABANK\u2019s net interest income, which is the difference between income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We are unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, competition for loans and deposits, domestic and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets.\nAlthough the general economic environment has shown improvement since the end of the economic recession in June 2009, there can be no assurance that improvement will continue. Economic growth has been slow and uneven, and continuing concerns over the federal deficit and government spending have contributed to uncertain conditions for the economy. The change in domestic government administration in early 2017 may have had positive ramifications toward mitigating adverse impacts on the business, including, but not limited to: higher levels of interest rates which could continue to rise in the future, potential for greater loan fee revenues from commercial/business capital investment, reduction in corporate tax rate levels by the tax reform legislation enacted in December 2017, and relaxation of certain financial regulatory reform measures.\nHowever, the outcome of the pending U.S. election, a return of recessionary conditions, including declines in real estate values and sales volumes, an increase in unemployment, and/or negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect economic conditions in the market areas in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, supply of and demand for deposits, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.\nIn addition, geopolitical matters, including international political unrest, foreign trade disputes, and slow growth in the global economy, as well as acts of terrorism, war and other violence could result in further disruptions in the financial markets. These negative events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, including our liquidity position, and may affect our ability to access capital.\nThe geographic concentration of our markets makes our business highly susceptible to local economic conditions. Adverse economic factors affecting particular geographies or industries, especially the southeastern United States, could have a negative effect on our customers and their ability to make payments to us.\nUnlike larger organizations that are more geographically diversified, our offices are primarily concentrated in selected markets in the southeastern United States. As a result of this geographic concentration, our financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas.\nA downturn in segments of the commercial and residential real estate industries in our markets due to adverse economic factors affecting particular industries could have an adverse effect on our customers. Deterioration in economic conditions in the markets we serve could result in one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nan increase in loan delinquencies;\n\u2022\nan increase in the allowance for credit losses;\n\u2022\nan increase in problem assets and foreclosures;\n\u2022\na decrease in the demand for our products and services;\n\u2022\na decrease in the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, the value of assets associated with problem loans and collateral coverage; and/or\n\u2022\na decrease in supply of customer deposits, which could impact our liquidity.\nThe Government\u2019s responses to economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe FOMC of the FRB, in an attempt to stimulate the overall economy, has, among other things, kept interest rates low through its targeted federal funds rate. While the FOMC continues to observe sustained economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and stable inflation, it has signaled a pause in its recent efforts to increase the federal funds rate and made three recent cuts of 25 basis points each in 2019. Decreases in the federal funds rate could cause overall interest rates to fall, which may negatively impact financial performance from greater borrower refinancing incentives. Increases in the federal funds rate and the unwinding of its balance sheet could cause overall interest rates to rise, which may negatively impact the U.S. real estate markets and affect deposit growth and pricing. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nChanges in interest rates and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our earnings and financial condition, and we may incur losses if we are unable to successfully manage interest rate risk.\nOur net interest income may be reduced if more interest-earning assets than interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature during a period when interest rates are declining, or more interest-bearing liabilities than interest-earning assets reprice or mature during a period when interest rates are rising.\nChanges in the difference between short- and long-term interest rates may also harm our business. For example, short-term deposits may be used to fund longer-term loans. When differences between short-term and long-term interest rates shrink or disappear, as is possible when the FOMC is tightening monetary policy by raising the target fed funds rate, the spread between rates paid on deposits and received on loans could narrow significantly, thereby decreasing our net interest income.\nIf market interest rates rise rapidly, interest rate adjustment caps may limit increases in interest rates on adjustable rate loans, thereby reducing our net interest income. Similarly, interest rate adjustment floors may limit the upside benefit to increases in interest rates. In the event that market interest rates fall rapidly, loan and bond prepayments may occur as borrowers refinance and pay off debt prior to stated maturity. As a result, yields on earning assets could decline, thereby reducing net interest income. If an unprecedented negative rate environment were to occur, our operations and margin would be adversely impacted and could result in increased credit losses.\nWe attempt to manage our risk from changes in market interest rates by adjusting the rates, maturity, repricing characteristics, and balances of the different types of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. We employ the use of models and modeling techniques to quantify the levels of risks to net interest income, which inherently involve the use of assumptions, judgments, and estimates. While we strive to ensure the accuracy of our modeled interest rate risk profile, there are inherent limitations and imprecisions in this determination and actual results may differ. As of December 31, 2019, a 100 basis point instantaneous and parallel upward shift in interest rates was estimated to increase net interest income over 12 months by approximately 1.9%. Similarly, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates was expected to decrease net interest income by 5.7% over the same period.\nAt December 31, 2019, approximately 38% of our total loan portfolio had fixed interest rates. About 96% of the investment portfolio had fixed interest rates as of December 31, 2019. Approximately 90% of our time deposit base and 49% of our Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings will mature and/or re-price within 12 months.\nUncertainty about the future of LIBOR may adversely affect our business.\nIn 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced that it intends to halt persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. As a result, LIBOR, as currently operated, may not continue after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. At this time, little consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR. One leading alternative rate, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is not directly comparable to LIBOR and cannot easily or simply be substituted for it in outstanding instruments. Key differences between the two are: SOFR is based on secured lending, while LIBOR is not; and SOFR is limited to overnight lending, while LIBOR encompasses several short-term maturity periods. It is impossible to predict the effect of any alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans. Our primary exposures to LIBOR are in variable-rate loans and in hedging transactions. The lack of a leading alternative to LIBOR means that LIBOR continues to be used in many new instruments. In addition, it is not known how a transition away from LIBOR, or to a new version of LIBOR, will impact our ability to use hedge accounting after 2021.\nCertain instruments issued by us, including our outstanding Series B, Series C and Series D preferred stock, have floating rate terms based on LIBOR.\nAs mentioned above, it is not known whether LIBOR will continue after 2021 in a legally workable form. There is a risk that an adverse outcome of the LIBOR transition after 2021 could increase our interest, dividend, and other costs relative to our outstanding Series B, Series C and Series D preferred stock. We may not be able to refinance those instruments on terms that reduce those costs to the level we would have expected if LIBOR were to continue indefinitely, unchanged. Additionally, a transition from LIBOR could adversely impact or change our hedge accounting practices.\nIf we or our subsidiaries were unable to borrow funds through access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers, or the operating cash needs to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.\nLiquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. IBERIABANK\u2019s liquidity is used primarily to fund loans and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and limits are established by our Board of Directors. Management and the Investment Committee regularly monitor the overall liquidity position of IBERIABANK and the Company to ensure that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. Management and the Investment Committee also establish policies and monitor guidelines to diversify IBERIABANK\u2019s funding sources to avoid concentrations in any one market source. Funding sources include federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, customer deposits, and short- and long-term debt. IBERIABANK is also a member of the FHLB System, which provides funding through advances to members that are collateralized with mortgage-related assets.\nWe maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity. There are other sources of liquidity available to us should they be needed. These sources include sales or securitizations of loans, our ability to acquire additional national market, non-core or brokered deposits, additional collateralized borrowings such as the FRB discount window, the issuance and sale of debt securities, and the issuance and sale of preferred or common securities in public or private offerings. Amounts available under our existing credit facilities as of December 31, 2019 consist of $8.4 billion in FHLB availability. The Company also had various funding arrangements with the Federal discount window and commercial banks providing up to $332.6 million in the form of federal funds and other lines of credit.\nIf we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, we might be unable to meet customers\u2019 needs, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital.\nAdditionally, the Company is often the recipient of dividends from its subsidiaries, including IBERIABANK, and may rely on these dividends as a source of cash flow. The amount of future dividends from IBERIABANK is dependent upon its performance and could be impacted by future unanticipated economic conditions and regulatory limitations. Such events could impact the Company\u2019s ability to declare future dividends and ultimately its solvency if other sources of cash flows were not available.\nDeposit run-off or a change in deposit mix could increase our funding costs.\nA major portion of our net income comes from our interest rate spread, which is the difference between the interest rates we pay on amounts used to fund assets and the interest rates and fees we receive on our interest-earning assets. We rely on deposits as a stable, low-cost source of funding for our interest-earning assets. We must compete with other banks and financial institutions for deposits. If our competitors raise rates on their deposits, we may face deposit attrition or experience higher funding costs by increasing our deposit rates in order to maintain our customer deposit base. Higher funding costs would increase interest expense, thereby reducing our net interest margin, net interest income, and net income. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 25% of our deposits were non-interest-bearing.\nMarket perceptions of our credit risk could impair our liquidity, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.\nOur liquidity and borrowing costs are largely impacted by our credit risk. Market perception could have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital markets or borrow funds and increase the costs of capital and borrowings. In addition, deterioration in our credit risk, whether actual or perceived, could trigger unfavorable contractual obligations, resulting in the requirement to post additional collateral or realize credit-related contingent features.\nCREDIT RISKS\nOur business is highly susceptible to credit risk.\nAs a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that the collateral securing the payment of their loans (if any) may not be sufficient to satisfy our customers\u2019 loan obligations in the event of default. Credit losses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our total loan portfolio was approximately $24.0 billion, or 76% of total assets. At that date, the major components of our loan portfolio comprised 69% commercial loans (of which 61% was commercial real estate and 39% was commercial and industrial), 20% mortgage loans (primarily residential 1-4 family mortgage loans), and 11% consumer and other loans (primarily home equity). Our credit risk with respect to our consumer installment and commercial loan portfolios relates principally to the general creditworthiness of individuals and businesses within our local market areas. Our credit risk with respect to our residential and commercial real estate mortgage and construction loan portfolios relates principally to the general creditworthiness of individuals and businesses, the value of real estate as collateral, and guarantors serving as security for the repayment of the loans.\nOur loan portfolio has been and will continue to be affected by real estate markets. Real estate industry pricing dynamics in the geographical markets we operate can vary from year to year, and with respect to construction, can vary between project funding and project completion. Asset values to which we underwrite loans can fluctuate from year to year and impact collateral values and the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. An additional risk in connection with loans secured by commercial real estate is the effect of unknown or unexpected environmental contamination, which could make the real estate effectively unmarketable or otherwise significantly reduce its value as security, or could expose us to remediation liabilities as the lender. We make credit and reserve decisions based on the current conditions of borrowers or projects combined with our expectations for the future. If a deterioration in economic conditions or prices beyond our expectations were to occur in any of the market areas we serve, we could experience higher charge-offs and delinquencies above amounts provided for in the allowance for credit losses. As such, our earnings could be adversely affected through higher than anticipated provisions for credit losses.\nWe frequently participate in group lending transactions, such as participations or syndications, which include shared national credits. These transactions often have a lead bank that is responsible for servicing the overall credit facility. In that capacity, the lead bank is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the borrower's financial performance, covenant compliance and collateral verification, among other duties. In transactions where IBERIABANK serves as the lead, we are obligated to properly manage certain credits on behalf of other banks. In other group lending transactions, we must rely on another bank serving in the lead capacity to execute the respective duties and communicate relevant information on the borrower's status. In those instances where we are not the lead bank, we may not receive information that impacts our risk rating process in a timely manner, and/or have limited ability to influence situations that require resolution of a problem asset, which could result in unforeseen credit losses. In addition, shared national credits are a specific focus of regulatory examinations that can result in directed downgrades, including placement of a credit on non-accrual status, reversal of interest previously recorded as income and/or charge-offs.\nOur allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover actual credit losses, which could adversely affect our earnings. Events unforeseen by us could result in higher loan losses impacting our results of operations.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses in an attempt to cover losses in our loan portfolio (funded and unfunded). Loan losses will likely occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than we have experienced to date based on unanticipated adverse changes and/or new facts and circumstances which are currently not available to management as of the respective reporting period. Increases in the allowance will result in decreases in our earnings.\nThe determination of the allowance involves a high degree of judgment and complexity, and is subject to scrutiny by bank regulators. If our assumptions and judgments require modifications (e.g., creditworthiness), our current allowance may not be sufficient and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio, which may have a significant impact on our financial statements. Further, changes in market factors, such as interest rates or commodity prices, could lead to increases in the allowance. While management monitors these market dynamics carefully, adverse changes to these factors could be unforeseen by management and would result in higher levels of allowance and credit losses. For example, unanticipated adjustments to management\u2019s current expectations could have an adverse impact to the allowance as the borrower\u2019s ability to repay within the terms of the contractual agreement may be reduced due to a lack of sufficient free cash flows, estimated collateral values may decline given the lack of market demand for collateralized assets, and the Company\u2019s ability to monetize guarantor support may be impaired as guarantor net worth may diminish.\nCommercial and commercial real estate loans generally are viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or other loans or investments. These types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and other consumer loans. Because the loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of a material amount of these loans may cause a significant increase in non-performing assets, TDRs and/or past due loans. An increase in non-performing assets, TDRs, and/or past due loans could result in a loss of earnings, an increase in the provision for credit losses, or an increase in loan charge-offs, which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Our emphasis on loan growth and on increasing our portfolio of multi-family, commercial business and commercial real estate loans, as well as any future credit deterioration, could also require us to increase our allowance further in the future.\nThe adoption of the new accounting standard for credit losses may result in increases to the Company's allowance for credit losses and increased volatility in net income and capital.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326). This accounting standard replaces the current incurred loss accounting model with a current expected credit loss approach (CECL) for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and other commitments to extend credit. The amendments made by ASC 326 require entities to consider all available relevant information when estimating current expected credit losses, including details about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The resulting allowance for credit losses is to reflect the portion of the amortized cost basis that the entity does not expect to collect. The amendments also eliminate the current accounting model for purchased credit impaired loans and debt securities. While the CECL model does not apply to available-for-sale debt securities, ASC 326 does require entities to record an allowance when recognizing credit losses for available-for-sale securities, rather than reduce the amortized cost of the securities by direct write-offs.\nThe Company adopted ASC 326 as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of ASC 326 will result in a higher allowance for credit losses due to the requirement to estimate lifetime expected credit losses and the remaining length of time to maturity for longer duration loans as well as higher reserves on certain acquired loans which had low reserve levels under the previous accounting guidance. While ASC 326 increased the ACL, it did not change the overall credit risk in the Company\u2019s loan and lease portfolios or the ultimate losses therein. The Company will record a one-time adjustment to its allowance in the first quarter of 2020 equal to the difference between its allowance under the incurred loss methodology and under the CECL methodology. The transition adjustment to increase the ACL is expected to result in a decrease to the opening shareholders' equity balance, net of income taxes, of between $59.5 million and $69.7 million as of January 1, 2020. ASC 326 is likely to result in increased volatility in the Company\u2019s net income and capital levels between reporting periods due to changes in the reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic conditions on a quarterly basis. See Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of ASC 326 and the transition adjustment recorded as of January 1, 2020.\nWe earn a significant portion of our non-interest revenue through sales of residential mortgages in the secondary market. We are exposed to counterparty credit, market, repurchase and other risks associated with these activities.\nThe Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk in the normal course of mortgage banking activities as well as market risk when engaging in these activities that is greatly impacted by the amount of liquidity in the secondary markets and changes in interest rates. We attempt to hedge our market risk based on modeling assumptions. The performance of these hedges could result in a deviation from our expectation and our operating results could be materially adversely impacted. Additionally, the Company retains repurchase risk associated with sales of these loans that is related to the Company\u2019s residential mortgage loan underwriting and closing practices. Increases in claims under these repurchase or make-whole demands, which typically arise when a borrower defaults, could have a material impact on our ability to continue participating in these types of activities as well as a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nDeclines in the value of certain investment securities could require write-downs, which would reduce our earnings.\nOur securities portfolio includes securities that are subject to declines in value due to negative perceptions about the health of the financial sector in general, the lack of liquidity for securities that are real estate related as well as credit-related concerns about the issuer. A prolonged decline in the value of these or other securities could result in an other-than-temporary impairment write-down, which would reduce our earnings. In the case of issuer default, a permanent impairment could be required that would reduce our earnings.\nREGULATORY/COMPLIANCE RISK\nChanges in government regulations and legislation could limit our future performance and growth.\nThe banking industry is heavily regulated. We are subject to examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies. The cost of compliance is significant and restricts certain of our activities. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect the federal deposit insurance fund, depositors, customers and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. The burdens imposed by federal and state regulations put banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors, such as finance companies, mortgage banking companies and leasing companies. Changes in the laws, regulations and regulatory practices affecting the banking industry may increase our costs of doing business or otherwise adversely affect us and create competitive advantages for others.\nFuture changes to the laws and regulations applicable to the financial industry, if enacted or adopted, may impact our profitability or financial condition, require more oversight or change certain of our business practices, and expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. Political volatility within the federal government, both in the legislative and in the executive branch, creates significant potential for major and abrupt shifts in federal policy regarding bank regulation, taxes, and the economy, any of which could have significant impacts on our business and financial performance. We cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory changes, including those that could benefit our business and results of operations, will be enacted or adopted or, if they are, whether they will have a material effect on us.\nWe have become subject to more stringent regulatory capital requirements, which may limit our operations and potential growth or adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or to repurchase shares.\nThe Company and IBERIABANK are subject to the comprehensive, consolidated supervision and regulation of the FRB and the OFI, including risk-based and leverage capital requirements. We must maintain certain risk-based and leverage capital ratios as required by our banking regulators, which can change depending on general economic conditions and the Company\u2019s particular condition, risk profile, growth plans, and regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. If at any time we fail to meet minimum established capital guidelines and/or other regulatory requirements, our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, the capital adequacy standards applicable to the Company and IBERIABANK under the BASEL III Capital Rules require us to satisfy more stringent capital and liquidity standards than in the past. These requirements, and any other new regulations, could result in lower returns, regulatory actions if we were unable to comply with such requirements, and adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares, or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Compliance with current or new capital requirements, including leverage ratios, may limit operations that require the intensive use of capital and could adversely affect our ability to expand or maintain present business levels. Additional information, including the Company\u2019s and IBERIABANK\u2019s compliance with applicable capital adequacy standards at December 31, 2019, is provided in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in the Capital Resources section of MD&A.\nWe are required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for our bank in times of stress.\nUnder federal law, we are required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to our bank, and to commit resources to support our bank if necessary. We may be required to commit additional resources to our bank at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources or when it may not be in our, or our shareholders' or our creditors\u2019 best interests to do so. Providing such support is more likely during times of financial stress for us and our bank, which may make any capital we are required to raise to provide such support more expensive than it might otherwise be. In addition, any capital loans we make to our bank are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of our bank. In the event of our bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of our bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions against us.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, requires financial institutions to design and implement programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, these policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur use of third party vendors and our other ongoing third party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.\nWe regularly use third party vendors as part of our business. We also have substantial ongoing business relationships with other third parties. These types of third party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by our federal bank regulators. Regulation requires us to perform due diligence and ongoing monitoring and control over our third party vendors and other ongoing third party business relationships. In certain cases we may be required to renegotiate our agreements with these vendors to meet these requirements, which could increase our costs. We expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for deficiencies in our oversight and control of our third party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which we have these relationships. As a result, if our regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our third party vendors or other ongoing third party business relationships or that such third parties have not performed appropriately, we could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nPossible future increases in FDIC deposit insurance premiums would adversely affect our earnings.\nOur deposits are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, we are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. We generally cannot control the amount of assessments we will be required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are financial institution failures in the future, we may be required to pay higher FDIC assessments than we currently do, or the FDIC may charge additional special assessments or require future prepayments. Increases in our assessment may also be required in the future to maintain the FDIC\u2019s designated reserve ratio at the required level. These potential increases in deposit assessments or special assessments may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. See the Non-interest Expense section of MD&A in this Form 10-K.\nWe may be adversely affected by recent changes in U.S. tax laws.\nWe are subject to federal and applicable state tax regulations. Such tax regulations are often complex and require interpretation and changes in these regulations could negatively impact our results of operations. In the normal course of business, we are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and applicable state tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments we have made and the business in which we have engaged. Recently, federal and state taxing authorities have become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions. These tax positions may relate to tax compliance, sales and use, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base, apportionment and tax credit planning. The challenges made by tax authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reported financial results depend on our management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates, and there may be changes in accounting policies or accounting standards that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting policies and assumptions are fundamental to our reported financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results. Our management must also exercise judgment in selecting assumptions and estimates inherent in deriving certain financial statement line items. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy, method, assumption and/or estimate to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under another acceptable alternative.\nFrom time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the form and content of our external financial statements. A discussion of the recent significant accounting standard updates which have been issued are included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Accounting standard updates have the potential to alter previously issued or future financial statements depending on their deviation from current standards or industry practices and the implementation method prescribed by the FASB. In addition, accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, banking regulators and our independent registered auditors) may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how standards should be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting standards and changes in current interpretations may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict and could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to intangible asset risk, which could negatively impact our financial results.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, we record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value, and, as such, business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill. We perform a goodwill evaluation at least annually to test for goodwill impairment. As part of its testing, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount using these qualitative factors or as part of the annual quantitative evaluation, the Company will recognize a goodwill impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Adverse conditions in our business climate, including a significant decline in future operating cash flows, a significant change in our stock price or market capitalization, or a deviation from our expected growth rate and performance may significantly affect the fair value of our goodwill and may trigger impairment losses, which could be material to our operating results and financial condition.\nWe completed such an evaluation for the Company during the fourth quarter of 2019 and concluded that an impairment charge was not necessary for the year ended December 31, 2019. We cannot provide assurance, however, that we will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would have an adverse effect on our shareholders\u2019 equity and financial results and could cause a decline in our stock price.\nThe required accounting treatment of troubled loans we acquired through acquisitions could result in higher net interest margins and interest income in current periods and lower net interest margins and interest income in future periods.\nUnder GAAP, we are required to record troubled loans acquired through acquisitions at fair value, which may underestimate or overestimate the actual performance of such loans. If these loans outperform our original fair value estimates, the difference between our original estimate and the actual performance of the loan (the \u201cdiscount\u201d) is accreted into net interest income. Thus, our net interest margins may initially appear higher. Conversely, if these loans under-perform our original fair value estimates, our net interest margins would be lower than initially estimated. We expect the yields on our loans to decline as our acquired loan portfolio pays down or matures, and we expect downward pressure on our interest income to the extent that the runoff on our acquired loan portfolio is not replaced with comparable high-yielding loans. This could result in higher net interest margins and interest income in current periods and lower net interest rate margins and interest income in future periods.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nA failure in or an attack on our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our business, result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause financial losses.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets. These transactions, as well as the information technology services we provide to clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards. Due to the breadth of our client base and our geographical reach, developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure is challenging, particularly as a result of rapidly evolving legal and regulatory requirements, technological shifts, integration of new platforms and third party relationships. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities, or those of our third party vendors, may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as a spike in transaction volume, cyber attack or other unforeseen catastrophic events, which may adversely affect our ability to process transactions or services.\nIn addition, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks, as well as those of our third party vendors. Although we take protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information and our clients\u2019 information across all geographic and product lines, and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of these threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber attacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact. Despite the defensive measures we take to manage our internal technological and operational infrastructure, these threats may originate externally from third parties such as foreign governments, organized crime and other hackers, and outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or may originate internally from within our organization. Given the increasingly high volume of our transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they can be discovered and rectified.\nWe also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure. In addition, as interconnectivity with our clients grows, we increasingly face the risk of operational failure with respect to our clients\u2019 systems.\nIf one or more of these cyber incidents occurs, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, as well as our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 operations, which could result in damage to our reputation, substantial costs, regulatory penalties and/or client dissatisfaction or loss. Potential costs of a cyber attack may include, but would not be limited to, remediation costs, increased protection costs, lost revenue from the unauthorized use of proprietary information or the loss of current and/or future customers, and litigation.\nWe maintain an insurance policy which we believe provides sufficient coverage at a manageable expense for an institution of our size and scope with similar technological systems. However, no assurance can be given that this policy would be sufficient to cover all potential financial losses, damages, penalties, including lost revenues, should we experience any one or more of our or a third party\u2019s systems failing or experiencing attack.\nThe loss of certain key personnel could negatively affect our operations.\nAlthough we have employed a significant number of additional executive officers and other key personnel, our success continues to depend in large part on the retention of a limited number of key executive management, lending and other personnel. We could undergo a difficult transition period if we were to lose the services of any of these individuals. Our success also depends on the experience of our banking facilities\u2019 managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of these key persons could negatively impact the affected banking operations. The unexpected loss of key senior managers, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.\nCatastrophic events could negatively affect our local economies or disrupt our operations, which would have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nThe occurrence of catastrophic events, including weather events and other natural disasters such as hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, floods and fires, or other disasters, such as pandemics, crime, terrorism or other acts of violence, could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Such events can disrupt our operations, cause damage to our properties and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage that may be caused by these catastrophes will affect our operations or the economies in our market areas, but such events could result in a decline in loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing our loans and an increase in payment delinquencies, foreclosures and loan losses.\nWe may be subject to increased litigation which could result in legal liability and damage to our reputation.\nThe Company and IBERIABANK have been named from time to time as defendants in class actions and other litigation relating to our businesses and activities. Litigation may include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. We and our subsidiaries are also involved from time to time in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business. These matters also could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.\nIn addition, in recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed \u201clender liability.\u201d Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders.\nSubstantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us, including our subsidiaries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause significant harm to our reputation.\nSTRATEGIC/REPUTATIONAL RISKS\nThe success of our financial institution acquisitions will depend on a number of uncertain factors.\nThe success of our financial institution acquisitions depends on a number of factors, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nOur ability to integrate the businesses acquired into IBERIABANK\u2019s current operations, including the conversion of customer loan and deposit data from the acquired banks\u2019 data processing systems to our data processing systems;\n\u2022\nOur ability to limit the outflow of deposits held by our new customers in the acquired businesses and to successfully retain and manage interest-earning assets (i.e., loans) acquired;\n\u2022\nOur ability to attract new deposits and to generate new interest-earning assets in the geographic areas previously served by the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nOur ability to effectively compete in new markets in which we did not previously have a presence;\n\u2022\nOur success in deploying the cash acquired in these transactions into assets bearing sufficiently high yields without incurring unacceptable risk;\n\u2022\nOur ability to control the incremental non-interest expense from the acquired businesses in a manner that enables us to maintain a favorable overall efficiency ratio;\n\u2022\nOur ability to retain and attract the appropriate personnel to staff and maintain the acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to earn acceptable levels of interest and non-interest income, including fee income, from the acquired businesses.\nIn any acquisition involving a financial institution, particularly one involving the transfer of a large number of branches and/or customers, there may be business and service changes and disruptions, including delays or errors in the data conversion process, that result in the loss of customers or cause customers to close their accounts and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration of such acquired businesses is an operation of substantial size and expense, and may be impacted by general market and economic conditions or government actions affecting the financial services industry. Integration efforts also are likely to divert our management\u2019s attention and resources. No assurance can be given that we will be able to integrate these acquired businesses successfully. The integration process could also result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of bank acquisitions. Further, we may encounter unexpected difficulties or costs during the integration that could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition, perhaps materially. Additionally, no assurance can be given that the operation of acquired businesses will not adversely affect our existing profitability, that we will be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by our existing banking business, that we will be able to compete effectively in the market areas currently served by the acquired businesses, or that we will be able to manage any growth resulting from financial institution acquisitions effectively.\nOur ability to grow acquired businesses following these transactions depends in part on our ability to retain certain key personnel we expect to hire and/or retain in connection with these transactions. We believe that the ties these employees have in the local banking markets previously served by their acquired businesses are vital to our ability to maintain our relationships with existing customers and to generate new business in these markets. Our failure to hire or retain these employees could adversely affect the success of these transactions and our future growth.\nOur ability to achieve and maintain expense reduction and earnings enhancement initiatives may be adversely affected by external factors not within our control.\nWe continuously assess opportunities for expense reduction and revenue enhancement to improve annual returns. While many of the elements necessary to achieve certain initiatives are within our control, others such as interest rates and prevailing economic conditions, which influence expenses and revenues, depend on external factors not within our control, and there can be no assurance that external factors will not materially adversely affect our ability to fully implement and accomplish past and future initiatives.\nWe face substantial competition and are subject to certain regulatory constraints not applicable to some of our competitors, which may decrease our growth or profits.\nWe face substantial competition for deposits, and for credit, title and trust relationships, and other financial services and products in the communities we serve. Competing providers include other banks, thrifts and trust companies, insurance companies, mortgage banking operations, credit unions, finance companies, title companies, money market funds and other financial and nonfinancial companies which may offer products functionally equivalent to those offered by us. Competing providers may have greater financial resources than we do and offer services within and outside the market areas we serve. In addition to this challenge of attracting and retaining customers for traditional banking services, our competitors include securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors and finance and insurance companies who seek to offer one-stop financial services to their customers that may include services that financial institutions have not been able or allowed to offer to their customers in the past. The increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. If we are unable to adjust both to increased competition for traditional banking services and changing customer needs and preferences, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nSome of our competitors, including credit unions, are not subject to certain regulatory constraints, such as the Community Reinvestment Act, which, among other things, requires us to implement procedures to make and monitor loans throughout the communities we serve. Credit unions also have federal tax exemptions that may allow them to offer lower rates on loans and higher rates on deposits than taxpaying financial institutions such as commercial banks. In addition, non-depository institution competitors are generally not subject to the extensive regulation applicable to institutions, like IBERIABANK, that offer federally insured deposits. Other institutions may have other competitive advantages in particular markets or may be willing to accept lower profit margins on certain products. These differences in resources, regulation, competitive advantages, and business strategy may decrease our net interest margin, may increase our operating costs, and may make it harder for us to compete profitably.\nOur success depends on our ability to respond to the threats and opportunities of fintech innovation.\nFintech developments, such as bitcoin, have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way banks do business. Investment in new technology to stay competitive would result in significant costs and increased risks of cyber security attacks. Our success depends on our ability to adapt to the pace of the rapidly changing technological environment, which is crucial to retention and acquisition of customers.\nWe experience increasing competition from nonbank companies, including technology companies, both inside and outside of our market area. Many technology companies have focused on the financial sector and now offer a broad variety of software and payment products primarily over the Internet, with a focus on mobile device delivery. These companies generally are not subject to regulatory burdens comparable to those applicable to banks and may accordingly offer products and services at more favorable rates and with greater convenience to the customer. This competition by technology companies could cause regulated depository institutions such as the Bank to lose fee income as well as customer deposits and related income.\nOn July 31, 2018, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced that it would begin accepting applications for a special purpose national bank charter from nondepository \u201cfintech\u201d companies engaged in core banking activities, such as paying checks or lending money. Ongoing legal challenges by state banking regulators, however, have delayed the use of the special purpose fintech charter, and the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York has ruled in a recent decision that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency does not have the authority to grant a bank charter to a nonbank entity that is not eligible for federal deposit insurance. While the future of the federal special purpose bank charter is in doubt, it would, if widely implemented, allow fintech companies to operate nationwide under a single set of national standards, without needing to seek state-by-state licenses or joining with brick-and-mortar banks, and would therefore allow fintech companies to more easily compete with us for financial products and services in the communities we serve.\nReputational risk and social factors may impact our results.\nOur ability to originate and maintain accounts is highly dependent upon consumer and other external perceptions of our business practices and/or our financial health. Adverse perceptions regarding our business practices and/or our financial health could damage our reputation in both the customer and funding markets, leading to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them. Adverse developments with respect to the consumer or other external perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, may also adversely impact our reputation. In addition, adverse reputational impacts on third parties with whom we have important relationships may also adversely impact our reputation. Adverse impacts to our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, may lead to greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny and litigation risk. We carefully monitor internal and external developments for areas of potential reputational risk and have established governance structures to assist in evaluating such risks in our business practices and decisions.\nRISKS ABOUT OUR SECURITIES\nWe are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments.\nThere can be no assurance of whether or when we may pay dividends in the future. Cash available to pay dividends to our shareholders is derived primarily, if not entirely, from dividends paid to us from our subsidiaries. The ability of our subsidiary bank to pay dividends to us as well as our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders is limited by regulatory and legal restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital. In addition, if we fail to satisfy the minimum capital conservation buffer requirement, we will be subject to certain limitations, which include restrictions on capital distributions. We may also decide to limit the payment of dividends even when we have the legal ability to pay them in order to retain earnings for use in our business. Further, any lenders making loans to us may impose financial covenants that may be more restrictive than regulatory requirements with respect to the payment of dividends.\nWe are prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock if the required payments on our subordinated debentures have not been made. Additionally, dividends on our common stock could be adversely impacted if dividend payments on our preferred stock have not been made.\nAlthough we have paid cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the past, we may not pay cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the future.\nHolders of shares of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such purpose. We have a history of paying dividends to our shareholders. However, future cash dividends will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, the need to maintain adequate capital levels, the need to comply with safe and sound banking practices as well as meet regulatory expectations, and other factors, including the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us, which ability may be restricted by statutory, contractual or other constraints. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends even if the necessary financial conditions are met and if sufficient cash is available for distribution. See Note 13 and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on factors impacting or restricting our ability to pay dividends.\nOur common stock and our preferred stock are subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.\nShares of our common stock and our Series B, Series C, and Series D preferred stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness of the Company. This means that shares of the common stock and depositary shares, which represent fractional interests in shares of Series B, Series C, and Series D preferred stock, rank junior to all our existing and future indebtedness and our other non-equity claims with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us, including claims in the event of our liquidation. We are prohibited from paying dividends on any of our capital stock if the required payments on our subordinated debentures have not been made.\nOur common stock is subordinate to our existing and future preferred stock.\nThe Company has outstanding Series B, Series C and Series D preferred stock that is senior to the common stock and could adversely affect the ability of the Company to declare or pay dividends or distributions of common stock. Under the terms of the Series B, Series C and Series D preferred stock, the Company is prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock unless all full dividends for the latest dividend period on all outstanding shares of Series B, Series C and Series D preferred stock have been declared and paid in full or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment of those dividends has been set aside. Furthermore, if the Company experiences a material deterioration in its financial condition, liquidity, capital, results of operations or risk profile, the Company\u2019s regulators may not permit it to make future payments on its Series B, Series C and Series D preferred stock, thereby preventing the payment of dividends on the common stock.\nWe may issue debt and/or equity securities, or securities convertible into equity securities, any of which may be senior to our existing preferred and common stock as to distributions and in liquidation, and such an issuance could negatively affect the value of our common and preferred stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by entering into debt or debt-like financing that is unsecured or secured by all or up to all of our assets, or by issuing additional debt or equity securities, which could include issuances of secured or unsecured commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior notes, subordinated notes, preferred stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities. In the event of our liquidation, our lenders and holders of our debt and preferred securities would receive a distribution of our available assets before distributions to the holders of our common stock. Subject to certain conditions, holders of future potential issuances of another class of preferred stock may be entitled to preferences over the Series B, Series C and Series D preferred stock. Because our decision to incur debt and issue securities in our future offerings will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings and debt financings. Further, market conditions could require us to accept less favorable terms for the issuance of our securities in the future.\nThe trading history of our common stock is characterized by modest trading volume.\nOur common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. During 2019, the average daily trading volume of our common stock was approximately 346,000 shares. The average daily trading volume of our depositary shares, which represent fractional shares of our Series B preferred stock, was approximately 4,000 shares; the average daily trading volume of our depositary shares, which represent fractional shares of our Series C preferred stock, was approximately 7,000 shares; and the average daily trading volume of our depositary shares, which represent fractional shares of our Series D preferred stock, was approximately 30,000 shares.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in us will lead to a more active trading market in our securities or how much more liquid these markets might become. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends upon the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our securities at any given time, which presence is dependent upon the individual decisions of investors, over which we have no control.\nThe market price of our securities can be volatile.\nThe market prices of our common and preferred stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors, including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in other risk factors and the following:\n\u2022\nactual or unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in the legal or regulatory environment in which we operate;\n\u2022\npress releases, announcements or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our securities;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions in our marketplace, general conditions in the U.S. economy, financial markets or the banking industry; and\n\u2022\nother developments affecting our competitors or us.\nThese factors may adversely affect the trading prices of our securities, regardless of our actual operating performance, and could prevent our shareholders from selling their securities at or above the public offering price. In addition, the stock markets, from time to time, experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market prices of our securities, regardless of our trading performance.\nIn the past, shareholders have brought securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may be the target of similar litigation in the future, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nMERGER-RELATED RISKS\nBecause the market price of First Horizon common stock may fluctuate, holders of IBKC common stock cannot be certain of the market value of the merger consideration they will receive.\nIn the merger, each share of IBKC common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time (other than certain shares held by First Horizon or IBKC) will be converted into 4.584 shares of First Horizon common stock. This exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either First Horizon common stock or IBKC common stock. Changes in the price of First Horizon common stock between now and the time of the merger will affect the value that holders of IBKC common stock will receive in the merger. Neither First Horizon nor IBKC is permitted to terminate the merger agreement as a result of any increase or decrease in the market price of First Horizon common stock or IBKC common stock.\nStock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in IBKC\u2019s and First Horizon\u2019s businesses, operations and prospects and regulatory considerations, many of which factors are beyond IBKC\u2019s control. Therefore, at the time of the IBKC special meeting, holders of IBKC common stock will not know the market value of the consideration that IBKC shareholders will receive at the effective time. You should obtain current market quotations for shares of IBKC common stock.\nThe market price of First Horizon common stock after the merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting the shares of IBKC common stock or First Horizon common stock currently.\nIn the merger, holders of IBKC common stock will become holders of First Horizon common stock. First Horizon\u2019s business differs from that of IBKC. Accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of First Horizon common stock after the completion of the merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of each of First Horizon and IBKC.\nCombining First Horizon and IBKC may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and IBKC may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nThe success of the merger will depend, in part, on the ability to realize the anticipated cost savings from combining the businesses of First Horizon and IBKC. To realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from the merger, First Horizon and IBKC must integrate and combine their businesses in a manner that permits those cost savings to be realized, without adversely affecting current revenues and future growth. If First Horizon and IBKC are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual cost savings of the merger could be less than anticipated, and integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses.\nAn inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, levels of expenses and operating results of the combined company, which may adversely affect the value of the common stock of the combined company after the completion of the merger.\nFirst Horizon and IBKC have operated and, until the completion of the merger, must continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key associates, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the companies\u2019 ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and associates or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger. Integration efforts between the two companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on IBKC during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the merger on the combined company.\nFurthermore, the board of directors and executive leadership of the combined company will consist of former directors and executive officers from each of First Horizon and IBKC. Combining the boards of directors and management teams of each company into a single board and a single management team could require the reconciliation of differing priorities and philosophies.\nThe combined company may be unable to retain First Horizon and/or IBKC personnel successfully after the merger is completed.\nThe success of the merger will depend in part on the combined company\u2019s ability to retain the talents and dedication of key associates currently employed by IBKC. It is possible that these associates may decide not to remain with IBKC while the merger is pending or with the combined company after the merger is consummated. If IBKC is unable to retain key associates, including management, who are critical to the successful integration and future operations of the company, IBKC could face disruptions in its operations, loss of existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment costs. In addition, if key associates terminate their employment, the combined company\u2019s business activities may be adversely affected and management\u2019s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating First Horizon and IBKC to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause the combined company\u2019s business to suffer. In addition, IBKC may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements for any key associates who leave.\nRegulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the merger.\nBefore the merger may be completed, various approvals, consents and non-objections must be obtained from the Federal Reserve Board and various other bank regulatory, antitrust, insurance and other authorities in the United States. In determining whether to grant these approvals, such regulatory authorities consider a variety of factors, including the regulatory standing of each party. These approvals could be delayed or not obtained at all, including due to: an adverse development in either party\u2019s regulatory standing or in any other factors considered by regulators when granting such approvals; governmental, political or community group inquiries, investigations or opposition; or changes in legislation or the political environment generally. The Federal Reserve Board has stated that if material weaknesses are identified by examiners before a banking organization applies to engage in expansionary activity, the Federal Reserve Board will expect the banking organization to resolve all such weaknesses before applying for such expansionary activity. The Federal Reserve Board has also stated that if issues arise during the processing of an application for expansionary activity, it will expect the applicant banking organization to withdraw its application pending resolution of any supervisory concerns.\nThe approvals that are granted may impose terms and conditions, limitations, obligations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company\u2019s business or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose any such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger or otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger if the merger were consummated successfully within the expected timeframe. In addition, there can be no assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger. Additionally, the completion of the merger is conditioned on the absence of certain orders, injunctions or decrees by any court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction that would prohibit or make illegal the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.\nIn addition, despite the parties\u2019 commitments to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with conditions imposed by regulators, under the terms of the merger agreement, neither IBKC will be required, and neither party will be permitted without the prior written consent of the other party, to take actions or agree to conditions that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the combined company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the merger.\nCertain of IBKC\u2019s directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that may differ from the interests of holders of IBKC common stock.\nHolders of IBKC common stock should be aware that some of IBKC\u2019s directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger and have arrangements that are different from, or in addition to, those of holders of IBKC common stock. These interests and arrangements may create potential conflicts of interest. The IBKC board of directors was aware of these respective interests and considered these interests, among other matters, when making its decision to approve the merger agreement, and in recommending that holders of common stock vote to approve the merger agreement.\nThe merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms, and the merger may not be completed.\nThe merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger. Those conditions include: (i) the approval of the First Horizon merger proposal and the First Horizon charter amendment proposal by the requisite vote of the First Horizon shareholders; (ii) the approval of the IBKC merger proposal by the requisite vote of the IBKC shareholders; (iii) authorization for listing on the NYSE of the shares of First Horizon common stock and rollover First Horizon preferred stock (or depositary shares in respect thereof) to be issued in the merger; (iv) the receipt of all required regulatory approvals which are necessary to close the merger and the bank merger and the expiration of all statutory waiting periods without the imposition of any materially burdensome regulatory condition; (v) the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-4 and the absence of a stop order or proceeding initiated or threatened by the SEC for that purpose; (vi) the absence of any order, injunction, decree or other legal restraint preventing the completion of the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or making the completion of the merger illegal; (vii) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of each party, generally subject to a material adverse effect qualification; (viii) the prior performance in all material respects by each party of the obligations required to be performed by it at or prior to the closing date; and (ix) receipt by each party of an opinion from its counsel to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.\nThese conditions to the closing may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the merger may not be completed. In addition, the parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time, before or after shareholder approval, or First Horizon or IBKC may elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain other circumstances.\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively impact IBKC.\nIf the merger agreement is not completed for any reason, including as a result of First Horizon shareholders failing to approve either the First Horizon merger proposal or IBKC shareholders failing to approve the IBKC merger proposal, there may be various adverse consequences and IBKC may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its customers and associates. For example, IBKC\u2019s business may have been impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger. Additionally, if the merger agreement is terminated, the market price of IBKC common stock could decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be beneficial and will be completed. IBKC also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to proceedings commenced against IBKC to perform its obligations under the merger agreement. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, IBKC may be required to pay a termination fee of $156 million to First Horizon.\nAdditionally, IBKC has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as the costs and expenses of preparing, filing, printing and mailing a joint proxy statement/prospectus, and all filing and other fees paid in connection with the merger. If the merger is not completed, IBKC would have to pay these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger.\nIBKC will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on associates and customers may have an adverse effect on IBKC. These uncertainties may impair IBKC\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with IBKC to seek to change existing business relationships with IBKC. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, IBKC has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course prior to the closing, and IBKC is restricted from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions without the consent of First Horizon until the merger is completed. These restrictions may prevent IBKC from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer that might be willing to pay more to acquire or merge with IBKC.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that restrict IBKC\u2019s ability to, among other things, initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate, inquiries or proposals with respect to, or, subject to certain exceptions generally related to the exercise of fiduciary duties by its board of directors, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or nonpublic information or data relating to, any alternative acquisition proposals. These provisions, which include a $156 million termination fee payable under certain circumstances, might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of IBKC from considering or proposing that acquisition even if, in the case of a potential acquisition of IBKC, it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share price to IBKC shareholders than what is contemplated in the merger, or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire IBKC than it might otherwise have proposed to pay.\nThe shares of First Horizon common stock to be received by holders of IBKC common stock as a result of the merger will have different rights from the shares of IBKC common stock.\nIn the merger, holders of IBKC common stock will become holders of First Horizon common stock and their rights as shareholders will be governed by Tennessee law and the governing documents of the combined company. The rights associated with First Horizon common stock are different from the rights associated with IBKC common stock.\nIBKC will incur transaction and integration costs in connection with the merger.\nIBKC has incurred and expects to incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with negotiating the merger agreement and closing the merger. In addition, the combined company will incur integration costs following the completion of the merger as First Horizon and IBKC integrate their businesses, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. There can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will be realized to offset these transaction and integration costs over time. IBKC may also incur additional costs to maintain associate morale and to retain key associates. IBKC will also incur significant legal, financial advisory, accounting, banking and consulting fees, fees relating to regulatory filings and notices, SEC filing fees, printing and mailing fees and other costs associated with the merger. Some of these costs are payable regardless of whether the merger is completed.\nIn connection with the merger, First Horizon will assume IBKC\u2019s outstanding debt obligations and preferred stock, and the combined company\u2019s level of indebtedness following the completion of the merger could adversely affect the combined company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital and to meet its obligations under its existing indebtedness.\nIn connection with the merger, First Horizon will assume IBKC\u2019s outstanding indebtedness and IBKC\u2019s obligations related to its outstanding preferred stock. First Horizon\u2019s existing debt, together with any future incurrence of additional indebtedness, and the assumption of IBKC\u2019s outstanding preferred stock, could have important consequences for the combined company\u2019s creditors and the combined company\u2019s shareholders. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nlimit the combined company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nrestrict the combined company from making strategic acquisitions or cause the combined company to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nrestrict the combined company from paying dividends to its shareholders;\n\u2022\nincrease the combined company\u2019s vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nrequire a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on the combined company\u2019s indebtedness and dividends on the preferred stock, thereby reducing the combined company\u2019s ability to use cash flows to fund its operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities.\nFollowing completion of the merger, holders of First Horizon common stock will be subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of the holders of the First Horizon preferred stock and the rollover First Horizon preferred stock that First Horizon will issue upon completion of the merger. Holders of shares of IBKC preferred stock, which will be converted into rollover First Horizon preferred stock, as well as holders of shares of First Horizon preferred stock and any shares of preferred stock that First Horizon may issue in the future, would receive, upon the combined company\u2019s voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, before any payment is made to holders of First Horizon common stock, their liquidation preferences as well as any accrued and unpaid distributions. These payments would reduce the remaining amount of the combined company\u2019s assets, if any, available for distribution to holders of its common stock.\nGeneral market conditions and unpredictable factors, including conditions and factors different from those affecting IBKC preferred stock and IBKC depositary shares currently, could adversely affect market prices for rollover First Horizon preferred stock and rollover First Horizon depositary shares once the rollover First Horizon preferred stock is issued\nThere can be no assurance about the market prices for the rollover First Horizon preferred stock that will be issued upon completion of the merger or the rollover First Horizon depositary shares. Several factors, many of which are beyond the control of First Horizon, could influence the market prices of the rollover First Horizon preferred stock and the rollover First Horizon depositary shares, including:\n\u2022\nwhether the combined company declares or fails to declare dividends on the rollover First Horizon preferred stock from time to time;\n\u2022\nreal or anticipated changes in the credit ratings assigned to the rollover First Horizon preferred stock and the rollover First Horizon depositary shares or other First Horizon securities;\n\u2022\nthe combined company\u2019s creditworthiness;\n\u2022\ninterest rates;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in the securities, credit and housing markets, and developments with respect to financial institutions generally;\n\u2022\nthe market for similar securities; and\n\u2022\neconomic, corporate, securities market, geopolitical, regulatory or judicial events that affect the combined company, the banking industry or the financial markets generally.\nShares of rollover First Horizon preferred stock will be equity interests and will not constitute indebtedness. As such, rollover First Horizon preferred stock and rollover First Horizon depositary shares will rank junior to all indebtedness of, and other non-equity claims on, the combined company with respect to assets available to satisfy claims. The market prices for the rollover First Horizon preferred stock and rollover First Horizon depositary shares following the merger may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the IBKC preferred stock and IBKC depositary shares.\nHolders of IBKC common stock will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in the combined company after the merger and will exercise less influence over management.\nHolders of IBKC common stock currently have the right to vote in the election of the board of directors and on other matters affecting IBKC. When the merger is completed, each IBKC shareholder will become a shareholder of First Horizon, and each holder of First Horizon common stock and each holder of IBKC common stock will become a holder of common stock of the combined company, with a percentage ownership of the combined company that is smaller than the shareholder\u2019s percentage ownership of either First Horizon or IBKC individually, as applicable, prior to the consummation of the merger. Based on the number of shares of First Horizon and IBKC common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2019, and based on the number of shares of First Horizon common stock expected to be issued in the merger, the former holders of IBKC common stock, as a group, are estimated to own approximately forty-four percent (44%) of the outstanding shares of the combined company immediately after the merger and current holders of First Horizon common stock as a group are estimated to own approximately fifty-six percent (56%) of the outstanding shares of the combined company immediately after the merger. Because of this, holders of IBKC common stock may have less influence on the management and policies of the combined company than they now have on the management and policies of IBKC.\nHolders of IBKC common stock will not have dissenters\u2019 rights or appraisal rights in the merger.\nAppraisal rights (also known as dissenters\u2019 rights) are statutory rights that, if applicable under law, enable shareholders to dissent from an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, and to demand that the corporation pay the fair value for their shares as determined by a court in a judicial proceeding instead of receiving the consideration offered to shareholders in connection with the extraordinary transaction.\nUnder Part 13 of the LBCA, the holders of IBKC common stock will not be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the merger if, on the record date for the IBKC special meeting, IBKC\u2019s shares are traded in an organized market that has at least two thousand (2,000) shareholders and a market value of at least $20 million. IBKC common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ, a national securities exchange, and is expected to continue to be so listed on the record date for the IBKC special meeting. Accordingly, the holders of IBKC common stock are not entitled to any appraisal rights in connection with the merger.\nHolders of record of IBKC preferred stock are entitled to exercise appraisal rights in connection with the merger, provided the proper procedures of Part 13 of the LBCA are followed. DTC, as nominee for the depository, is the holder of record of the shares of IBKC preferred stock as of the date of this Report.\nThe IBKC depositary shares are not a class or series of shares issued by IBKC and thus appraisal rights under Part 13 of the LBCA do not independently apply to the depositary shares. Accordingly, to exercise or to direct the depository to exercise appraisal rights with respect to the IBKC preferred stock, holders of depositary shares will be required to follow the procedures provided by the depository with respect thereto and in accordance with requirements of Louisiana law.\nShareholder litigation could prevent or delay the completion of the merger or otherwise negatively impact the business and operations of IBKC.\nShareholders of IBKC may file lawsuits against IBKC and/or the directors and officers of IBKC in connection with the merger. One of the conditions to the closing is that no order, injunction or decree issued by any court or governmental entity of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint preventing the consummation of the merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement be in effect. If any plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting IBKC defendants from completing the merger pursuant to the merger agreement, then such injunction may delay or prevent the effectiveness of the merger and could result in significant costs to IBKC, including any cost associated with the indemnification of directors and officers of each company. If a lawsuit is filed, IBKC may incur costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any shareholder lawsuits filed in connection with the merger. Such litigation could have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of IBKC and could prevent or delay the completion of the merger.", "PERMNO": 81564, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "IBKC"}
