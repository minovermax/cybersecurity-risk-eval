RISK FACTORS\nOur business faces significant risks and uncertainties. Certain important factors may have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors, in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this 10-K and our other public filings with the SEC. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur retail-based business model is impacted by general economic conditions in our markets, and ongoing economic and financial uncertainties may cause a decline in consumer spending that may adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity, financial results and stock price.\nAs a retail business that depends on consumer discretionary spending, we may be adversely affected if our customers reduce, delay or forego their purchases of our products as a result of continued job losses, bankruptcies, higher consumer debt and interest rates, higher energy and fuel costs, reduced access to credit, falling home prices, lower consumer confidence, uncertainty or changes in tax policies and tax rates and uncertainty due to potential national or international security concerns. Decreases in same store sales, customer traffic or average ticket sales negatively affect our financial performance, and a prolonged period of depressed consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our business. Promotional activities and decreased demand for consumer products could affect profitability and margins. In addition, adverse economic conditions may result in an increase in our operating expenses due to, among other things, higher costs of labor, energy, equipment and facilities. Due to recent fluctuations in the U.S. economy, our sales, operating and financial results for a particular period are difficult to predict, making it difficult to forecast results to be expected in future periods. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could adversely affect our stock price.\nOur concentration of stores in the Western United States makes us susceptible to adverse conditions in this region.\nThe majority of our stores are located in the Western United States, comprising Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. As a result, our operations are more susceptible to regional factors than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors. These factors include regional economic and weather conditions, natural disasters, demographic and population changes and governmental regulations in the states in which we operate. Environmental changes and disease epidemics affecting fish or game populations in any concentrated region may also affect our sales. If a region with a concentration of our stores were to suffer an economic downturn or other adverse event, our operating results could suffer.\nCompetition in the outdoor activities and sporting goods market could reduce our net sales and profitability.\nThe outdoor activities and sporting goods market is highly fragmented and competitive. We compete directly or indirectly with the following types of companies:\n\u00b7\nindependent, local specialty stores, often referred to as \u201cmom & pops\u201d;\n\u00b7\nother specialty retailers that compete with us across a significant portion of our merchandising categories through retail store, catalog or e-commerce businesses, such as Bass Pro Shops, Cabela\u2019s and Gander Mountain;\n\u00b7\nlarge-format sporting goods stores and chains, such as Academy Sports + Outdoors and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods; and\n\u00b7\nmass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, discount stores, department stores and online retailers, such as Amazon, Target and Wal-Mart.\nA few of our competitors have a larger number of stores, and some of them have a greater market presence, name recognition and financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we have. In addition, if our competitors reduce their prices, we may have to reduce our prices in order to compete, which could harm our margins. Furthermore, some of our competitors may build new stores in or near our existing locations. As a result of this competition, we may need to spend more on advertising and promotion. Some of our mass merchandising competitors, such as Wal-Mart, do not currently compete in many of the product lines we offer. However, if these competitors were to begin offering a broader array of competing products, or if any of the other factors listed above occurred, our net sales could be reduced or our costs could be increased, resulting in reduced profitability.\nIf we fail to anticipate changes in consumer demands, including regional preferences, in a timely manner, our operating results could suffer.\nOur products appeal to consumers who regularly hunt, camp, fish and participate in various shooting sports. The preferences of these consumers cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. In addition, due to different game and fishing species and varied weather conditions found in different markets, it is critical that our stores stock products appropriate for their markets. Our success depends on our ability to identify product trends in a variety of markets as well as to anticipate, gauge and quickly react to changing consumer demands in these markets. We usually must order merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season. The extended lead times for many of our purchases may make it difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or changes in prices. If we misjudge either the market for our products or our customers\u2019 purchasing habits, our net sales may decline significantly and we may not have sufficient quantities of merchandise to satisfy customer demand or we may be required to mark down excess inventory, either of which would result in lower profit margins and harm our operating results.\nOur expansion into new, unfamiliar markets presents increased risks that may prevent us from being profitable in these new markets.\nWe intend to expand by opening stores in new markets, which may include small- to medium-sized markets and which may not have existing national outdoor sports retailers. As a result, we may have less familiarity with local customer preferences and encounter difficulties in attracting customers due to a reduced level of customer familiarity with our brand. Other factors that may impact our ability to open stores in new markets and operate them profitably, many of which are beyond our control, include:\n\u00b7\nour ability to identify suitable locations, including our ability to gather and assess demographic and marketing data to determine consumer demand for our products in the locations we select;\n\u00b7\nour ability to negotiate favorable lease agreements;\n\u00b7\nour ability to properly assess the profitability of potential new retail store locations;\n\u00b7\nour ability to secure required governmental permits and approvals;\n\u00b7\nour ability to hire and train skilled store operating personnel, especially management personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of construction materials and labor and the absence of significant construction delays or cost overruns;\n\u00b7\nour ability to provide a satisfactory mix of merchandise that is responsive to the needs of our customers living in the areas where new retail stores are built;\n\u00b7\nour ability to supply new retail stores with inventory in a timely manner;\n\u00b7\nour competitors building or leasing stores near our retail stores or in locations we have identified as targets for a new retail store;\n\u00b7\nconsumer demand for our products, particularly firearms and ammunition, which drives traffic to our retail stores;\n\u00b7\nregional economic and other factors in the geographies in which we expand; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and business conditions affecting consumer confidence and spending and the overall strength of our business.\nOnce we decide on a new market and find a suitable location, any delays in opening new stores could impact our financial results. It is possible that events, such as delays in the entitlements process or construction delays caused by permitting or licensing issues, material shortages, labor issues, weather delays or other acts of god, discovery of contaminants, accidents, deaths or injunctions, could delay planned new store openings beyond their expected dates or force us to abandon planned openings altogether. In addition, new retail stores typically generate lower operating margins because pre-opening expenses are expensed as they are incurred and because fixed costs, as a percentage of net sales, are higher. Furthermore, the substantial management time and resources which our retail store expansion strategy requires may result in disruption to our existing business operations, which may decrease our profitability.\nAs a result of the above factors, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in operating our stores in new markets on a profitable basis.\nOur planned growth may strain our business infrastructure, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOver time, we expect to expand the size of our retail store network in new and existing markets. As we grow, we will face the risk that our existing resources and systems, including management resources, accounting and finance personnel and operating systems, may be inadequate to support our growth. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain the personnel or make the changes in our systems that may be required to support our growth. Failure to secure these resources and implement these systems on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, hiring additional personnel and implementing changes and enhancements to our systems will require capital expenditures and other increased costs that could also have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nOur expansion in new markets may also create new distribution and merchandising challenges, including strain on our distribution facility, an increase in information to be processed by our management information systems and diversion of management attention from existing operations towards the opening of new stores and markets. To the extent that we are not able to meet these additional challenges, our sales could decrease and our operating expenses could increase.\nOur ability to operate and expand our business and to respond to changing business and economic conditions will depend on the availability of adequate capital.\nThe operation of our business, the rate of our expansion and our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions depend on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn depends on cash flow generated by our business and, if necessary, the availability of equity or debt capital. We will also need sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations under our existing debt agreements. We paid total cash interest on our credit facilities of $16.4 million, $19.0 million and $4.0 million in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and our term loans require us to make quarterly principal payments of $0.4 million.\nThe amount that we are able to borrow and have outstanding under our revolving credit facility at any given time is subject to a borrowing base calculation, which is a contractual calculation equal to roughly (1) the lesser of (a) 90% of the net orderly liquidation value of our eligible inventory, and (b) 75% of the lower of cost or market value of our eligible inventory, plus (2) 90% of the eligible accounts receivable, less certain reserves against outstanding gift cards, layaway deposits and amounts outstanding under commercial letters of credit, each term as defined in the credit agreement for the revolving credit facility. As a result, our ability to borrow is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, such as a deterioration in the quality of our inventory (which is the largest asset in our borrowing base), a decline in sales activity and the collection of our receivables, which could reduce the funds available to us under our revolving credit facility.\nWe cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations or cash available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our needs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, and if availability under our revolving credit facility is not sufficient, we may have to obtain additional financing. If we obtain additional capital by issuing equity, the interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we incur additional indebtedness, that indebtedness may contain significant financial and other covenants that may significantly restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that we could obtain refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms or at all.\nOur revolving credit facility and term loans contain restrictive covenants that may impair our ability to access sufficient capital and operate our business.\nOur revolving credit facility and term loans contain various provisions that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nincur, create or assume certain indebtedness;\n\u00b7\ncreate, incur or assume certain liens;\n\u00b7\nmake certain investments;\n\u00b7\nmake sales, transfers and dispositions of certain property;\n\u00b7\nundergo certain fundamental changes, including certain mergers, liquidations and consolidations;\n\u00b7\npurchase, hold or acquire certain investments; and\n\u00b7\ndeclare or make certain dividends and distributions.\nThese covenants may affect our ability to operate and finance our business as we deem appropriate. If we are unable to meet our obligations as they become due or to comply with various financial covenants contained in the instruments governing our current or future indebtedness, this could constitute an event of default under the instruments governing our indebtedness.\nIf there were an event of default under the instruments governing our indebtedness, the holders of the affected indebtedness could declare all of that indebtedness immediately due and payable, which, in turn, could cause the acceleration of the maturity of all of our other indebtedness. We may not have sufficient funds available, or we may not have access to sufficient capital from other sources, to repay any accelerated debt. Even if we could obtain additional financing, the terms of the financing may not be favorable to us. In addition, substantially all of our assets are subject to liens securing our revolving credit facility and term loans. If amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility or term loans were accelerated, our lenders could foreclose on these liens and we could lose substantially all of our assets. Any event of default under the instruments governing our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur same store sales may fluctuate and may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance.\nOur same store sales may vary from quarter to quarter, and an unanticipated decline in net sales or same store sales may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly. A number of factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our same store sales results, including:\n\u00b7\nchanges or anticipated changes to regulations related to some of the products we sell;\n\u00b7\nconsumer preferences, buying trends and overall economic trends;\n\u00b7\nour ability to identify and respond effectively to local and regional trends and customer preferences;\n\u00b7\nour ability to provide quality customer service that will increase our conversion of shoppers into paying customers;\n\u00b7\ncompetition in the regional market of a store;\n\u00b7\natypical weather;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our product mix; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in pricing and average ticket sales.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations.\nWe experience moderate seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating results. On average over the last three fiscal years, we have generated 26.6% and 30.1% of our annual net sales in the third and fourth fiscal quarters, respectively, which includes the holiday selling season as well as the opening of the fall hunting season. We incur additional expenses in the third and fourth fiscal quarters due to higher purchase volumes and increased staffing in our stores. If, for any reason, we miscalculate the demand for our products or our product mix during the third or fourth fiscal quarters, our sales in these quarters could decline, resulting in higher labor costs as a percentage of sales, lower margins and excess inventory, which could cause our annual operating results to suffer and our stock price to decline. Due to our seasonality, the possible adverse impact from other risks associated with our business, including atypical weather, consumer spending levels and general business conditions, is potentially greater if any such risks occur during our peak sales seasons.\nWe rely on a single distribution center for our business, and if there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at such facility, we may be unable to deliver merchandise effectively to our stores or customers.\nWe rely on a single distribution center in Salt Lake City, Utah for our business. Any natural disaster or other serious disruption at such facility due to fire, tornado, earthquake, flood or any other cause could damage our on-site inventory or impair our ability to use such distribution center. While we maintain business interruption insurance, as well as general property insurance, the amount of insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover our losses in such an event. Any of these occurrences could impair our ability to adequately stock our stores or fulfill customer orders and harm our operating results.\nAny disruption of the supply of products from our vendors could have an adverse impact on our net sales and profitability.\nWe cannot predict when, or the extent to which, we will experience any disruption in the supply of products from our vendors. Any such disruption could negatively impact our ability to market and sell our products and serve our customers, which could adversely impact our net sales and profitability.\nWe depend on merchandise purchased from our vendors to obtain products for our stores. We have no contractual arrangements providing for continued supply from our key vendors, and our vendors may discontinue selling to us at any time. Changes in commercial practices of our key vendors or manufacturers, such as changes in vendor support and incentives or changes in credit or payment terms, could also negatively impact our results. If we lose one or more key vendors or are unable to promptly replace a vendor that is unwilling or unable to satisfy our requirements with a vendor providing equally appealing products at comparable prices, we may not be able to offer products that are important to our merchandise assortment.\nWe also are subject to risks, such as the price and availability of raw materials and fabrics, labor disputes, union organizing activity, strikes, inclement weather, natural disasters, war and terrorism and adverse general economic and political conditions, that might limit our vendors\u2019 ability to provide us with quality merchandise on a timely and cost-efficient basis. We may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality and more expensive than those we currently purchase. Any delay or failure in offering products to our customers could have a material adverse impact on our net sales and profitability.\nIn addition, the SEC has adopted rules regarding disclosure of the use of conflict minerals (commonly referred to as tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold), which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries. We expect to incur costs to design and implement a process to discover the origin of the tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold used in the products we sell, and may incur costs to audit our conflict minerals disclosures. Our reputation may also suffer if the products we sell contain conflict minerals originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or surrounding countries.\nPolitical and economic uncertainty and unrest in foreign countries where our merchandise vendors are located and trade restrictions upon imports from these foreign countries could adversely affect our ability to source merchandise and operating results.\nIn fiscal year 2014, approximately 2.2% of our merchandise was imported directly from vendors located in foreign countries, with a substantial portion of the imported merchandise being obtained directly from vendors in China and El Salvador. In addition, we believe that a significant portion of our domestic vendors obtain their products from foreign countries that may also be subject to political and economic uncertainty. We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with changing economic, political and other conditions in foreign countries where our vendors are located, such as:\n\u00b7\nincreased import duties, tariffs, trade restrictions and quotas;\n\u00b7\nwork stoppages;\n\u00b7\neconomic uncertainties;\n\u00b7\nadverse foreign government regulations;\n\u00b7\nwars, fears of war and terrorist attacks and organizing activities;\n\u00b7\nadverse fluctuations of foreign currencies;\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters; and\n\u00b7\npolitical unrest.\nWe cannot predict when, or the extent to which, the countries in which our products are manufactured will experience any of the above events. Any event causing a disruption or delay of imports from foreign locations would likely increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and would adversely affect our operating results.\nIn addition, trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards and customs restrictions against clothing items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages or boycotts could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us or may require us to modify our current business practices, any of which could hurt our profitability.\nFinally, potential changes in federal restrictions on the importation of firearms and ammunition products could affect our ability to acquire certain popular brands of firearms and ammunition products from importers and wholesalers, which could negatively impact our net sales until replacements in the United States can be obtained, if at all.\nA failure in our e-commerce operations, security breaches and cyber security risks could disrupt our business and lead to reduced sales and growth prospects and reputational damage.\nOur e-commerce business is an important element of our brand and relationship with our customers, and we expect it to continue to grow. In addition to changing consumer preferences and shifting traffic patterns and buying trends in e-commerce, we are vulnerable to additional risks and uncertainties associated with e-commerce sales, including rapid changes in technology, website downtime and other technical failures, security breaches, cyber attacks, consumer privacy concerns, changes in state tax regimes and government regulation of internet activities. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce our e-commerce sales, increase our costs, diminish our growth prospects and damage our brand, which could negatively impact our results of operations and stock price.\nIn addition, there is no guarantee that we will be able to expand our e-commerce business. Many of our competitors already have e-commerce businesses that are substantially larger and more developed than ours, which places us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, there are regulatory restrictions on the sale of approximately 30% of our product offerings, such as ammunition, certain cutlery, firearms, propane and reloading powder. If we are unable to expand our e-commerce business, our growth plans will suffer and the price of our common stock could decline.\nWe do not collect sales taxes in some jurisdictions, which could result in substantial tax liabilities and cause our future e-commerce sales to decrease.\nAn increasing number of states have considered or adopted laws that attempt to impose tax collection obligations on out-of-state retailers. We believe that these initiatives are inconsistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding that states, absent congressional legislation, may not impose tax collection obligations on out-of-state e-commerce businesses unless the out-of-state e-commerce business has nexus with the state. A successful assertion by one or more states requiring us to collect taxes where we do not do so could result in substantial tax liabilities, including for past sales, as well as penalties and interest. The imposition by state governments of sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state e-commerce businesses who participate in e-commerce could also create additional administrative burdens for us, put us at a competitive disadvantage if they do not impose similar obligations on our competitors and decrease our future e-commerce sales, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nCurrent and future government regulations, in particular regulations relating to the sale of firearms and ammunition, may negatively impact the demand for our products and our ability to conduct our business.\nWe operate in a complex regulatory and legal environment that could negatively impact the demand for our products and expose us to compliance and litigation risks, which could materially affect our operations and financial results. These laws may change, sometimes significantly, as a result of political, economic or social events. Some of the federal, state or local laws and regulations that affect our business and demand for our products include:\n\u00b7\nfederal, state or local laws and regulations or executive orders that prohibit or limit the sale of certain items we offer, such as firearms, black powder firearms, ammunition, bows, knives and similar products;\n\u00b7\nthe ATF, regulations, audit and regulatory policies that impact the process by which we sell firearms and ammunition and similar policies of state agencies that have concurrent jurisdiction, such as the California Department of Justice;\n\u00b7\nlaws and regulations governing hunting and fishing;\n\u00b7\nlaws and regulations relating to the collecting and sharing of non-public customer information;\n\u00b7\nlaws and regulations relating to consumer products, product liability or consumer protection, including regulation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and similar state regulatory agencies;\n\u00b7\nlaws and regulations relating to the manner in which we advertise, market or sell our products;\n\u00b7\nlabor and employment laws, including wage and hour laws;\n\u00b7\nU.S. customs laws and regulations pertaining to proper item classification, quotas and the payment of duties and tariffs; and\n\u00b7\nFederal Trade Commission, or FTC, regulations governing the manner in which orders may be solicited and prescribing other obligations in fulfilling orders and consummating sales.\nOver the past several years, bills have been introduced in the United States Congress that would restrict or prohibit the manufacture, transfer, importation or sale of certain calibers of handgun ammunition, impose a tax and import controls on bullets designed to penetrate bullet-proof vests, impose a special occupational tax and registration requirements on manufacturers of handgun ammunition and increase the tax on handgun ammunition in certain calibers. Because we carry these products, such legislation could, depending on its scope, materially harm our sales.\nAdditionally, state and local governments have proposed laws and regulations that, if enacted, would place additional restrictions on the manufacture, transfer, sale, purchase, possession and use of firearms, ammunition and shooting-related products. For example, in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting in Newtown, Connecticut and other incidents in the United States, several states, such as Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York, have enacted laws and regulations that limit access to and sale of certain firearms in ways more restrictive than federal laws. Other state or local governmental entities may continue to explore similar legislative or regulatory restrictions that could prohibit the manufacture, sale, purchase, possession or use of firearms and ammunition. In New York and Connecticut, mandatory screening of ammunition purchases is now required. In addition, California and the District of Columbia have adopted requirements for micro-stamping (that is, engraving the handgun\u2019s serial number on the firing pin of new handguns), and at least seven other states and the United States Congress have introduced microstamping legislation for certain firearms. Lastly, some states prohibit the sale of firearms without internal or external locking mechanisms, and several states are considering mandating certain design features on safety grounds, most of which would be applicable only to handguns. Other state or local governmental entities may also explore similar legislative or regulatory initiatives that may further restrict the manufacture, sale, purchase, possession or use of firearms, ammunition and shooting-related products.\nThe regulation of firearms, ammunition and shooting-related products may become more restrictive in the future. Changes in these laws and regulations or additional regulation, particularly new laws or increased regulations regarding sales and ownership of firearms and ammunition, could cause the demand for and sales of our products to decrease and could materially adversely impact our net sales and profitability. Sales of firearms represent a significant percentage of our net sales and are critical in drawing customers to our stores. A substantial reduction in our sales or margins on sales of firearms and firearm related products due to the establishment of new regulations could harm our operating results. Moreover, complying with increased or changed regulations could cause our operating expenses to increase.\nWe may incur costs from litigation relating to products that we sell, particularly firearms and ammunition, which could adversely affect our net sales and profitability.\nWe may incur damages due to lawsuits relating to products we sell, including lawsuits relating to firearms, ammunition, tree stands and archery equipment. We may incur losses due to lawsuits, including potential class actions, relating to our performance of background checks on firearms purchases and compliance with other sales laws as mandated by state and federal law. We may also incur losses from lawsuits relating to the improper use of firearms or ammunition sold by us, including lawsuits by municipalities or other organizations attempting to recover costs from manufacturers and retailers of firearms and ammunition. Our insurance coverage and the insurance provided by our vendors for certain products they sell to us may be inadequate to cover claims and liabilities related to products that we sell. In addition, claims or lawsuits related to products that we sell, or the unavailability of insurance for product liability claims, could result in the elimination of these products from our product line, thereby reducing net sales. If one or more successful claims against us are not covered by or exceed our insurance coverage, or if insurance coverage is no longer available, our available working capital may be impaired and our operating results could be materially adversely affected. Even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds and management time and could have a negative impact on our profitability and on future premiums we would be required to pay on our insurance policies.\nWe recently lost a jury trial in which monetary damages of $11.9 million were awarded against the defendants in the claim, which included us. If we are not successful in having the verdict set aside or, if necessary, winning an appeal to the decision, we may be required to pay the full amount of damages.\nOn March 12, 2014, we were added as a defendant to a pending consolidated action filed against United Farmers of Alberta Co-Operative Limited, the seller of Wholesale Sports, Wholesale Sports, Alamo Group and Donald F. Gaube and spouse. The amended complaint was filed by the landlords of two stores we did not assume in our purchase of assets from Wholesale Sports. Such stores were formerly operated by Wholesale Sports in Skagit and Thurston Counties in Washington. The amended complaint alleged breach of lease, breach of collateral assignment, misrepresentation, intentional interference with contract, piercing the corporate veil and violation of Washington\u2019s Fraudulent Transfer Act. The Company was named as a co-defendant with respect to the intentional interference with contract and fraudulent conveyance claims. The amended complaint sought against us and all defendants unspecified money damages, declaratory relief and attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. On March 9, 2015, a jury awarded $11.9 million against the defendants to the action, including us. We are reviewing the decision and have recorded a $4.0 million accrual in our results for the fiscal year and fourth quarter ended January 31, 2015. We expect to file post-trial motions seeking to have the verdict set aside, and, if necessary, will appeal the decision. Interest on the award will accrue at the weekly average one-year constant maturity (nominal) Treasury yield, as published by the Federal Reserve System (currently at 0.22%) while any appeal is pending. If we are not successful in having the verdict set aside or, if necessary, winning an appeal to the decision, we may be required to pay the full amount of damages.\nIf we fail to maintain the strength and value of our brand, our net sales are likely to decline.\nOur success depends on the value and strength of the Sportsman\u2019s Warehouse brand. The Sportsman\u2019s Warehouse name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality merchandise and a consistent, high quality customer experience. Our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Any of these events could result in decreases in net sales.\nOur inability or failure to protect our intellectual property could have a negative impact on our operating results.\nOur trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, domain names and other intellectual property are valuable assets that are critical to our success. The unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our intellectual property could diminish the value of our brands or goodwill and cause a decline in our net sales. Any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. As a result, any such claim could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information could harm our business and standing with our customers.\nThe protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical to us. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential customer information, such as payment card and personally identifiable information. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, could damage our reputation, expose us to risk of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and harm our business.\nOur computer hardware and software systems are vulnerable to damage that could harm our business.\nOur success, in particular our ability to successfully manage inventory levels, largely depends upon the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to track inventory information at the store level, communicate customer information and aggregate daily sales, margin and promotional information. These systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\n\u00b7\nfire, flood, tornado and other natural disasters;\n\u00b7\npower loss, computer system failures, internet and telecommunications or data network failures, operator negligence, improper operation by or supervision of employees, physical and electronic loss of data or security breaches, misappropriation and similar events;\n\u00b7\nhacking by third parties and computer viruses; and\n\u00b7\nupgrades, installations of major software releases and integration with new systems.\nAny failure that causes an interruption in our systems processing could disrupt our operations and result in reduced sales. We have centralized the majority of our computer systems in our corporate office. It is possible that an event or disaster at our corporate office could materially and adversely affect the performance of our company and the ability of each of our stores to operate efficiently.\nOur private brand offerings expose us to various risks.\nWe expect to continue to grow our exclusive private brand offerings through a combination of brands that we own and brands that we license from third parties. We have invested in our development and procurement resources and marketing efforts relating to these private brand offerings. Although we believe that our private brand products offer value to our customers at each price point and provide us with higher gross margins than comparable third-party branded products we sell, the expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to certain specific risks in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this section, such as:\n\u00b7\npotential mandatory or voluntary product recalls;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights (including defending against counterfeit, knock offs, grey-market, infringing or otherwise unauthorized goods);\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully administer and comply with obligations under license agreements that we have with the licensors of brands, including, in some instances, certain minimum sales requirements that, if not met, could cause us to lose the licensing rights or pay damages; and\n\u00b7\nother risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail.\nAn increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors\u2019 products, which may, in turn, adversely affect our relationship with our vendors. Our failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business, our operating results and financial condition could suffer.\nOur performance depends largely on the leadership efforts and abilities of our executive officers and other key employees. We have entered into employment agreements with John V. Schaefer, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Kevan P. Talbot, our Chief Financial Officer and Secretary. None of our other employees have an employment agreement with us. If we lose the services of one or more of our key employees, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our growth objectives. As our business grows, we will need to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in a timely manner.\nOur business depends on our ability to meet our labor needs.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, including district managers, store managers, department managers and sales associates, who understand and appreciate our outdoor culture and are able to adequately represent this culture to our customers. Qualified individuals of the requisite caliber and number needed to fill these positions may be in short supply in some areas, and the turnover rate in the retail industry is high. If we are unable to hire and retain sales associates capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service, as demonstrated by their enthusiasm for our culture and knowledge of our merchandise, our business could be materially adversely affected. Although none of our employees is currently covered by collective bargaining agreements, our employees may elect to be represented by labor unions in the future, which could increase our labor costs. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract a sufficient number of employees. An inability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified individuals in the future may delay the planned openings of new stores. Any such delays, any material increases in employee turnover rates at existing stores or any increases in labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nIncreases in the minimum wage could adversely affect our financial results.\nFrom time to time, legislative proposals are made to increase the federal minimum wage in the United States, as well as the minimum wage in a number of individual states. Base wage rates for some of our employees are at or slightly above the minimum wage. As federal or state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wage rates of our minimum wage employees, but also the wages paid to our other hourly employees as well. Any increase in the cost of our labor could have an adverse effect on our operating costs, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may pursue strategic acquisitions or investments, and the failure of an acquisition or investment to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe may from time to time acquire or invest in complementary companies, businesses or assets. The success of such acquisitions or investments will be based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation, operations, growth potential, integration and other factors relating to the respective business or assets. Our acquisitions or investments may not produce the results that we expect at the time we enter into or complete the transaction. For example, we may not be able to capitalize on previously anticipated synergies. Furthermore, acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or write-offs of goodwill or other intangibles, any of which could harm our financial condition or results of operations. We also may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire, including their personnel, financial systems, supply chain and other operations, which could adversely affect our business. Acquisitions may also result in the diversion of our capital and our management\u2019s attention from other business issues and opportunities.\nA proposed new standard for lease accounting may significantly impact the timing and amount in which we report our lease expense.\nIn August 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, and the International Accounting Standards Board, or IASB, issued an exposure draft that proposes substantial changes to existing lease accounting that would affect all lease arrangements. Subsequent meetings of the joint committee of the FASB and the IASB have made further changes to the proposed lease accounting.\nUnder the current proposed accounting model, lessees would be required to record an asset representing the right-to-use the leased item for the lease term, or right-of-use asset, and a corresponding liability to make lease payments. The right-of-use asset and liability incorporate the rights arising under the lease and are based on the lessee\u2019s assessment of expected payments to be made over the lease term. The proposed model requires measuring these amounts at the present value of the future expected payments. For the majority of our leases, we expect that the lease expense would include the amortization of the right-of-use asset and the recognition of interest expense based upon the lessee\u2019s incremental borrowing rate (or the rate implicit in the lease, if known) on the repayment of the lease obligation.\nThe FASB issued a revised lease accounting exposure draft in May 2013. A proposed effective date has not yet been announced. The FASB and IASB are considering comment letters on the revised exposure draft and are expected to issue a final standard in 2015. Currently, management is unable to assess the impact the adoption of the new final lease standard will have on our financial statements. Although we believe the presentation of our financial statements will likely change, including the pattern of lease expense recognition, we do not believe the accounting pronouncement will change the fundamental economic reasons for which we lease our stores.\nWe may not achieve projected goals and objectives in the time periods that we anticipate or announce publicly, which could harm our business and cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe set targets and timing to accomplish certain objectives regarding our business. We have included some of these targets in this filing and may make similar future public statements. For example, we state in this filing that:\n\u00b7\nwe currently plan to open eight additional new stores in fiscal year 2015 and, for the next several years thereafter, intend to grow our store base at a rate greater than 10 percent annually; and\n\u00b7\nwe target a minimum 10% four-wall Adjusted EBITDA margin and a minimum return on invested capital of 50% excluding initial inventory cost (or 20% including initial inventory cost) in the first twelve months of operation for a new store.\nThis filing also includes other forecasts and targets. These forecasts and targets are based on our current expectations. We may not achieve these forecasts and targets, and the actual achievement and timing of these events can vary due to a number of factors, including currently unforeseen matters and matters beyond our control. You should not unduly rely on these forecasts or targets in deciding whether to invest in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nAffiliates of Seidler Equity Partners III, L.P. (collectively, \u201cSeidler\u201d) beneficially own approximately 52.7% of our common stock, and their interests may conflict with or differ from the interests of our other stockholders.\nSeidler beneficially owns approximately 52.7% of our common stock. As a result, Seidler has significant influence over the election of all of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions that require the approval of our board of directors or stockholders, such as mergers and the sale of substantially all of our assets. So long as Seidler continues to own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our common stock, it will have the ability to exert significant influence over our corporate decisions. Seidler may act in a manner that advances its best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders by, among other things:\n\u00b7\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control transaction;\n\u00b7\nentrenching our management and/or our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us;\n\u00b7\ndiscouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us; or\n\u00b7\ncausing us to enter into transactions or agreements that are not in the best interests of all stockholders.\nAdditionally, Seidler is in the business of making investments in companies and may in the future acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or our suppliers or customers. Seidler may also pursue acquisitions that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nSeidler and the members of our board of directors who are affiliated with Seidler, by the terms of our certificate of incorporation, are not required to offer us any transaction opportunity of which they become aware and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment, unless such opportunity is expressly offered to them solely in their capacity as our directors. We, by the terms of our certificate of incorporation, expressly renounce any interest in any such corporate opportunity to the extent permitted under applicable law, even if the opportunity is one that we would reasonably be deemed to have pursued if given the opportunity to do so, unless such opportunity is expressly offered to any director or officer in his or her capacity as our director or officer. Our certificate of incorporation cannot be amended to eliminate our renunciation of any such corporate opportunity arising prior to the date of any such amendment. Seidler or its affiliates may also acquire competing businesses that may not be attractive to us, and have no obligation to refrain from acquiring competing businesses. Any competition could intensify if an affiliate or subsidiary of Seidler were to enter into or acquire a business similar to our specialty retail operations. Seidler or its affiliates may enter into or acquire a competing business in the future.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of The NASDAQ Stock Market corporate governance standards and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from some of the corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of other companies.\nAffiliates of Seidler control a majority of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of The NASDAQ Stock Market corporate governance standards. As a controlled company, we are exempt from some of The NASDAQ Stock Market corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\n\u00b7\na majority of the board of directors consist of \u201cindependent directors\u201d as defined under The NASDAQ Stock Market corporate governance standards;\n\u00b7\nour director nominees be selected, or recommended for our board of directors\u2019 selection, either (1) by a majority of independent directors in a vote by independent directors, pursuant to a nominations process adopted by a board resolution, or (2) by a nominating and governance committee comprised solely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the nominations process; and\n\u00b7\nthe compensation of our executive officers be determined, or recommended to the board for determination, by a majority of independent directors in a vote by independent directors, or by a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors.\nA majority of our board of directors currently consist of independent directors, and we have an audit committee and a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors. However, our nominating and governance committee are not comprised solely of independent directors. As long as we are a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we could avail ourselves of any of the exemptions described above even if we are not currently relying upon them. Accordingly, for so long as we are a \u201ccontrolled\ncompany,\u201d our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of The NASDAQ Stock Market corporate governance standards.\nOur bylaws, our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions of our bylaws, our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nestablishing a classified board of directors;\n\u00b7\nproviding that directors may be removed only for cause once Seidler owns shares of our common stock representing less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our capital stock;\n\u00b7\nnot providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u00b7\nrequiring at least a supermajority vote of our stockholders to amend our bylaws or certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation;\n\u00b7\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u00b7\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent once Seidler owns less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock; and\n\u00b7\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders.\nIn addition, we will be subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law once Seidler ceases to beneficially own at least 15% of the total voting power of our then-outstanding shares of common stock. In general, subject to some exceptions, Section 203 prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with any \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (which is generally defined as an entity or person who, together with the person\u2019s affiliates and associates, beneficially owns, or within three years prior to the time of determination of interested stockholder status did own, 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation), for a three-year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder. Section 203 could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nFurther, our certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees and agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents.\nTogether, these charter and statutory provisions could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock. The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures, as well as the significant common stock beneficially owned by Seidler, could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby potentially reducing the likelihood that our stockholders could receive a premium for their common stock in an acquisition.\nWe expect that the price of our common stock will fluctuate.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent our stockholders from being able to sell their common stock at or above the prices they paid for their common stock. The market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including:\n\u00b7\nour operating and financial performance and prospects, including seasonal fluctuations in our financial performance;\n\u00b7\nconditions that impact demand for our products;\n\u00b7\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u00b7\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts who track our common stock;\n\u00b7\nmarket and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u00b7\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u00b7\nchanges in federal and state government regulation;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u00b7\narrival or departure of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nsales of common stock by us or members of our management team; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war and responses to such events.\nIn addition, if the market for stocks in our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and distract our management.\nWe are an emerging growth company (\u201cEGC\u201d) within the meaning of The Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to EGCs may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nBecause we qualify as an EGC under the JOBS Act, we have elected to comply with some of the reduced disclosure and other reporting requirements available to us as an EGC for a period of up to five years following our initial public offering if we remain an EGC. For example, for as long as we remain an EGC, we are not subject to certain governance requirements, such as holding a \u201csay-on-pay\u201d and \u201csay-on-golden-parachute\u201d advisory votes, we are not required to include a \u201cCompensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d section in our proxy statements and reports filed under the Exchange Act, and we do not need to obtain an annual attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting from a registered public accounting firm pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d). We could be an EGC for a period up to the end of the fifth fiscal year after our initial public offering, although we will cease to be an EGC earlier than this five-year period if our total annual gross revenues equal or exceed $1 billion in a fiscal year, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt over a three-year period or if we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d (which requires, among other things, the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates to be at least $700 million as of the last business day of our second fiscal quarter of any fiscal year).\nAccordingly, for up to five fiscal years after our initial public offering, our stockholders may not receive the same level of disclosure that is afforded to stockholders of a non-EGC. It is possible that investors will find our common stock to be less attractive because we have elected to comply with the reduced disclosure and other reporting requirements available to us as an EGC, which could adversely affect the trading market for our common stock and the prices at which stockholders may be able to sell their common stock.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and results of operations and proxy or information statements in connection with matters upon which our stockholders may vote. As a result of our public disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition have become more visible, which could result in threatened or actual litigation, or other adverse actions taken by competitors and other third parties. In addition, our management team has limited experience managing a public company or complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies, and a number of our directors have limited experience serving on the boards of public companies. The time and resources necessary to comply with the requirements of being a public company and contend with any action that might be brought against us as a result of publicly available information could divert our resources and the attention of our management and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and to disclose any material weaknesses identified in our internal controls. Our management will be required to furnish an annual report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d), beginning with our annual report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2015 (to be filed in 2016). Currently, we are in the process of refining, implementing and testing the internal controls required to comply with Section 404. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. We could also become subject to investigations by The NASDAQ Stock Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently expect to retain all available funds and future earnings, if any, for use in the operation and growth of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to compliance with applicable law and any contractual provisions, including under the credit agreements governing our term loans and revolving credit facility and agreements governing any additional indebtedness we may incur in the future, that restrict or limit our ability to pay dividends, and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. Further, because we are a holding company, our ability to pay dividends depends on our receipt of cash dividends from our operating subsidiaries, which may further restrict our ability to pay dividends as a result of the laws of their jurisdiction of organization, agreements of our subsidiaries or covenants under our existing or future indebtedness. All of our business operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries, Sportsman\u2019s Warehouse, Inc. and Minnesota Merchandising Corporation and their subsidiaries. The ability of Sportsman\u2019s Warehouse, Inc. and Minnesota Merchandising Corporation to pay dividends to us, and our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock, is limited by our term loans. Our revolving credit facility also limits our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock. Our ability to pay dividends may also be restricted by the terms of any future credit agreement or any future debt or preferred equity securities of ours or of our subsidiaries.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business and our industry. Assuming we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business or our industry, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 14609, "SIC": 5940, "TIC": "SPWH"}
