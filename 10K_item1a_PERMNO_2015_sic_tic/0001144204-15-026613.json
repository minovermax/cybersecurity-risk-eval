{"cik": "1446159", "company": "Skyline Medical Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes.\nWe will require additional financing to sustain our operations, and if adequate financing is not available, we may be forced to go out of business. Such financing will be dilutive and feature restricted terms. Our independent public accounting firm has indicated in their audit opinion, contained in our financial statements, that they have serious doubts about our ability to remain a going concern.\nWe have not achieved profitability and anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses at least through the first two quarters of 2015. We had revenues of $952,000 in 2014, but we had negative operating cash flows of $3.4 million. As a result of our continued losses, our cash resources have not been sufficient to sustain our operations, and we have continued to depend on financing transactions to generate sufficient cash to stay in operation. Our private offerings of preferred stock and convertible debt in 2014 yielded aggregate gross proceeds of $3,555,000; however, our cash balance was only $16,000 as of December 31, 2014. As we manage our cash resources, our cash balance continues to fluctuate depending on the timing of receipt of product revenues and the proceeds of continued financing transactions, as well as the timing of our needs to pay for essential services and supplies to stay in operation. In April 2015 we raised gross proceeds of $100,000 from another private sale of convertible notes. These proceeds were used almost immediately, or will be used, to pay essential resources, in order to stay in operation. We are currently incurring negative operating cash flows of approximately $250,000 per month. Although we are attempting to curtail our expenses, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reduce these expenses significantly, and expenses for some periods may be higher as we prepare our product for broader sales, increase our sales efforts and maintain adequate inventories.\nWith limited cash available to fund our operating expenses, we have deferred or delayed payments to vendors, suppliers and service providers, opting instead to prioritize payments for personnel and essential resources. Our balance of debts, liabilities and cash obligations that are either considered past due or that will become due in calendar 2015 was approximately $6,417,000 as of December 31, 2014 and has continued to increase. We have negotiated payment arrangements with some of the parties to whom we owe payments, and in some cases we incur interest, late fees and penalties that cause our balance of obligations to increase further. Our outstanding debt at December 31, 2014 included $1,131,000 in principal amounts of convertible notes that are due and payable July 23, 2015, if not yet converted or redeemed.\nIn September 2014, we filed a registration statement with the SEC in connection with a proposed public offering of common stock and warrants. To date, this offering has not been completed. Although we continue to pursue this public offering, we may not be able to complete the offering, or the offering proceeds may not be sufficient to allow us to list our common stock on NASDAQ or any other exchange, or the offering proceeds may not be sufficient to fund our operations until we have positive cash flow or operate profitably. If we do not complete this public offering, we will continue to seek to raise sufficient capital to operate our business. If financing is available, it may be highly dilutive to our existing shareholders and may otherwise include burdensome or onerous terms.\nUnless and until we are able to raise sufficient capital, our lack of cash will continue to constrain our business and subject us to significant risks, including the following. First, we may be unable to make the necessary investment in personnel, equipment or other resources to effectively pursue our business plan. Second, our suppliers, vendors and service providers could slow down or stop supplying components or services or could stop extending credit in connection with commercial transactions, which could curtail our business. Third, we may be subject to lawsuits from claimants relating to past due balances, if we cannot work out or continue to renegotiate payment terms. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully defend against such claims, and our creditors or claimants may seek to seize our assets or assert other judicial remedies. Ultimately, any or all of the above factors could lead to a possible reduction or suspension of our operations, ultimately forcing us to declare bankruptcy, reorganize or go out of business. Should this occur, the value of any investment in our securities could be adversely affected, and an investor would likely lose all or a significant portion of their investment.\nAs a result of the above factors, our independent registered public accounting firm has indicated in their audit opinion, contained in our financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, that they have serious doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nOur limited operating history makes evaluation of our business difficult.\nWe were formed on April 23, 2002 and to date have generated only moderate though increasing revenue year by year. Our ability to implement a successful business plan remains unproven and no assurance can be given that we will ever generate sufficient revenues to sustain our business. We believe the increase in sales throughout the years may indicate that our business plan is on the right track, but we have a limited operating history which makes it difficult to evaluate our performance. You must consider our prospects in light of these risks and the expenses, technical obstacles, difficulties, market penetration rate and delays frequently encountered in connection with the development of new businesses. These factors include uncertainty whether we will be able to:\n\u00b7 Raise capital;\n\u00b7 Develop and implement our business plan in a timely and effective manner;\n\u00b7 Be successful in uncertain markets;\n\u00b7 Respond effectively to competitive pressures;\n\u00b7 Successfully address intellectual property issues of others;\n\u00b7 Protect and expand our intellectual property rights; and\n\u00b7 Continue to develop and upgrade our products.\nOur business is dependent upon proprietary intellectual property rights, which if we were unable to protect, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trade secret and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect our intellectual property. We currently own and may in the future own or license additional patent rights or trade secrets in the U.S., Europe, Asia, Canada, and elsewhere in the world that cover certain of our products. We rely on patent laws and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our products and intangible assets. These intellectual property rights are important to our ongoing operations and no assurance can be given that any measure we implement will be sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights. Also, with respect to our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, we cannot be certain that the confidentiality agreements we have entered into with consultants, vendors and employees will not be breached, or that we will have adequate remedies for any breach. We may lose the protection afforded by these rights through patent expirations, legal challenges or governmental action. If we cannot protect our rights, we may lose our competitive advantage if these patents were found to be invalid in the jurisdictions in which we sell or plan to sell our products. The loss of our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we become subject to intellectual property actions, this could hinder our ability to deliver our products and services and our business could be negatively impacted.\nWe may be subject to legal or regulatory actions alleging intellectual property infringement or similar claims against us. Companies may apply for or be awarded patents or have other intellectual property rights covering aspects of our technologies or businesses. Moreover, if it is determined that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, we may be prevented from marketing our products. In addition, many of our employees were previously employed at other medical device companies. We may be subject to claims that our employees have disclosed, or that we have used trade secrets or other proprietary information of our employees\u2019 former employers. While we are currently not subject to any material intellectual property litigation, any future litigation alleging intellectual property infringement could be costly, particularly in light of our limited resources. Similarly, if we determine that third parties are infringing on our patents or other intellectual property rights, our limited resources may prevent us from litigating or otherwise taking actions to enforce our rights. Any such litigation or inability to enforce our rights could require us to change our business practices, hinder or prevent our ability to deliver our products and services, and result in a negative impact to our business. Expansion of our business via product line enhancements or new product lines to drive increased growth in current or new markets may be inhibited by the intellectual property rights of our competitors and/or suppliers. Our inability to successfully mitigate those factors may significantly reduce our market opportunity and subsequent growth.\nWe face significant competition, including competition from companies with considerably greater resources than ours, and if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies, our market share may decline and our business could be harmed.\nOur industry is highly competitive with numerous competitors ranging from well-established manufacturers to innovative start-ups. A number of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution resources than we do. Their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to compete more effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products and technologies.\nWe estimate that the total market for surgical suction canisters is approximately $100 million and has a compound annual growth rate of 5%. We estimate the total cost of using surgical canisters is a multiple of $100 million because this amount does not include the labor to handle the canisters, disposal costs and solidifying compounds commonly used to minimize exposure to health care workers. Cardinal Health, Inc., a $90 billion plus medical manufacturer and distributor, is a leading competitor. Another one of our competitors is Stryker Instruments, a wholly owned subsidiary of Stryker Corporation, which is a publicly traded company with revenues of approximately $8 billion, and has a leading position in this market. Cardinal Health, Inc. has the Saf-T Pump that accommodates Medi-Vac suction canisters draining infectious fluid into the hospital sanitary sewer; though the canisters must be brought to the system for draining. Both of these competitors are better capitalized than we are.\nAlthough the Skyline STREAMWAY FMS is directly connected to the sanitary sewer, helping to reduce potential exposure to infectious fluids, it is possible that installation of the system will cause inconvenience and lost productivity as the operating rooms in which they are installed will need to be temporarily shut down. In addition, remodel work may be necessary in preparation for, or as a result of, an installation. In some cases, the costs to rework plumbing lines to accommodate for our system may outweigh the expected savings and/or lengthen the expected return on investment time.\nCompanies with significantly greater resources than ours may be able to reverse engineer our products and/or circumvent our intellectual property position. Such action, if successful, would greatly reduce our competitive advantage in the marketplace.\nWe believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including our technical innovations of unlimited suction and unlimited capacity capabilities, our innovative and advanced research and development capabilities, strength of our intellectual property rights, sales and distribution channels and advanced manufacturing capabilities. We plan to employ these and other elements as we develop our products and technologies, but there are many other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins, loss of market share and an inability to generate cash flows that are sufficient to maintain or expand our development and marketing of new products, which could adversely impact the trading price of the shares of our common stock.\nOur products require FDA clearance and our business will be subject to intense governmental regulation and scrutiny, both in the U.S. and abroad.\nIn March 2009, we filed a 510(k) submission with the FDA with respect to a product classification as a Class II non-exempt device. We cannot generate revenues from our product to be used in the surgical operating room without FDA clearance. We received written confirmation of final FDA clearance on April 1, 2009.\nThe potential production and marketing of some of our products, our ongoing research and development, any pre-clinical testing and clinical trial activities are subject to extensive regulation and review by FDA and other governmental authorities both in the United States and abroad. In addition to testing and approval procedures, extensive regulations also govern marketing, manufacturing, distribution, labeling, and record keeping. If we do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, violations could result in warning letters, non-approvals, suspensions of regulatory approvals, civil penalties and criminal fines, product seizures and recalls, operating restrictions, injunctions, and criminal prosecution.\nPeriodically, legislative or regulatory proposals are introduced that could alter the review and approval process relating to medical products. It is possible that the FDA will issue additional regulations further restricting the sale of our present or proposed products. Any change in legislation or regulations that govern the review and approval process relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain approval for new products, or to produce, market, and distribute existing products.\nOur product has only recently entered the commercial market and, although we anticipate market acceptance, we do not have enough customer experience with it to predict future demands.\nThe Skyline FMS has been launched into the fluid management market. We are currently manufacturing the Product, following GMP compliance regulations, at our own facility and anticipate the capability of producing the Skyline FMS in sufficient quantities for future near term sales. We have contracted with a manufacturing company that fits our standards and costs. We have sold and installed more than 79 FMS Systems to date and the product has been proven attractive to the target market due to its continuous suction and unlimited capacity ability, but other unknown or unforeseen market requirements may arise.\nIf our product is not accepted by our potential customers, it is unlikely that we will ever become profitable.\nThe medical industry has historically used a variety of technologies for fluid waste management. Compared to these conventional technologies, our technology is relatively new, and the number of companies using our technology is limited. The commercial success of our product will depend upon the widespread adoption of our technology as a preferred method by hospitals and surgical centers. In order to be successful, our product must meet the technical and cost requirements for these facilities. Market acceptance will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the willingness and ability of customers to adopt new technologies;\n\u00b7 our ability to convince prospective strategic partners and customers that our technology is an attractive alternative to conventional methods used by the medical industry;\n\u00b7 our ability to select and execute agreements with effective distributors and manufacturers representatives to market and sell our product; and\n\u00b7 our ability to assure customer use of the Skyline proprietary cleaning fluid and in-line filter.\nBecause of these and other factors, our product may not gain market acceptance or become the industry standard for the health care industry. The failure of such companies to purchase our products would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent for our success on a few key executive officers. Our inability to retain those officers would impede our business plan and growth strategies, which would have a negative impact on our business and the value of an investment.\nOur success depends on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our management team. We heavily depend on our management team; Joshua Kornberg, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chairman of the Board, David Johnson our Chief Operating Officer and Bob Myers our Chief Financial Officer. We have entered into employment agreements with all members of our senior management team and we may expand the relatively small number of executives in our company. Were we to lose one or more of these key individuals, we would be forced to expend significant time and money in the pursuit of a replacement, which could result in both a delay in the implementation of our business plan and the diversion of our limited working capital. We can give you no assurance that we can find satisfactory replacements for these key individuals at all, or on terms that are not unduly expensive or burdensome to our company. However, we have issued stock options and other equity-based compensation to attract and retain employees, and are confident that our team is committed to the products success.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to attract and retain technical personnel, sales and marketing personnel, and other skilled management.\nOur success depends to a significant degree on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel. Failure to attract and retain necessary technical, sales and marketing personnel and skilled management could adversely affect our business. If we fail to attract, train and retain sufficient numbers of these highly qualified people, our prospects, business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected.\nThe relative lack of public company experience of our management team may put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur early management team had limited public company experience, which had impaired our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The individuals who now constitute our senior management have had substantially more responsibility for managing publicly traded companies. Such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis. Our senior management team has been able to implement and affect programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately responds to such increased legal, regulatory compliance and reporting requirements. However, our failure to do so could lead to the imposition of fines and penalties and result in the deterioration of our business.\nCosts incurred because we are a public company may affect our profitability.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses, and we are subject to the SEC\u2019s rules and regulations relating to public disclosure that generally involve a substantial expenditure of financial resources. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, requires changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. We expect that full compliance with such rules and regulations will significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly, which may negatively impact our financial results. To the extent our earnings suffer as a result of the financial impact of our SEC reporting or compliance costs, our ability to develop an active trading market for our securities could be harmed.\nThere is currently a limited public trading market for our common stock and we cannot assure you that a more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained. Even if a market further develops, you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if you need to sell your shares to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.\nThere is currently a limited public trading market for our registered common stock. The numbers of institutions or persons interested in purchasing our registered common stock at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or nonexistent. This situation may be attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company that is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk averse and may be reluctant to follow a relatively unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we become more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot assure you that an active public trading market for our registered common stock will develop or be sustained.\nLimitations on director and officer liability and indemnification of our officers and directors by us may discourage shareholders from bringing suit against a director.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws provide, with certain exceptions as permitted by governing state law, that a director or officer shall not be personally liable to us or our shareholders for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct, fraud or knowing violation of law, or unlawful payments of dividends. These provisions may discourage shareholders from bringing suit against a director for breach of fiduciary duty and may reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation brought by shareholders on our behalf against a director. In addition, our articles of incorporation and bylaws may provide for mandatory indemnification of directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by governing state law.\nWe do not expect to pay common stock dividends for the foreseeable future, and we may never pay common stock dividends.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings to support the development and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying common stock cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future common stock dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including but not limited to, our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be limited by state law. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize certain returns on their investment.\nThe Company completed a private offering in February 2014 issuing Series A Convertible Preferred Stock paying dividends at 6% of the Stated Value per annum on a quarterly basis (see \u201cSubsequent Events\u201d in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report).\nOur stock may be thinly traded.\nOur common stock has been thinly traded, meaning there has been a low volume of buyers and sellers of the shares. Through this registration statement, we went public without the typical initial public offering procedures which usually include a large selling group of broker-dealers who may provide market support after going public. Thus, we will be required to undertake efforts to develop market recognition and support for our shares of common stock in the public market. The price and trading volume of our registered common stock cannot be assured. The numbers of institutions or persons interested in purchasing our registered common stock at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation may be attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days, weeks or months when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price.\nWe cannot give you any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained. Our ultimate intention is to apply for trading on either the NASDAQ Capital Market or the NYSE Alternext U.S. LLC (formerly American Stock Exchange) at such time that we meet the requirements for listing on those exchanges. We currently do not meet the objective listing criteria for listing on those exchanges and there can be no assurance as to when we will qualify for either of these exchanges or that we will ever qualify for these exchanges.\nIn order for our registered common stock to be eligible to trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market, we would need, among other things, a bid price of $3.00, $5 million in stockholders\u2019 equity, and $15 million market value of publicly held shares. In order for our registered common stock to be eligible to trade on the NYSE MKT: Std. #4, which is a market for small and mid-sized companies, we would need, among other things, at least $75 million in market capitalization, a minimum price of $3.00 and $20 million in market value of public float.\nCurrently, our market capitalization, revenues and stockholders\u2019 equity are insufficient to qualify for these exchanges. We would also need to meet the corporate governance and independent director and audit committee standards of NASDAQ and/or the NYSE Alternext U.S. LLC. We do satisfy such standards at this time.\nOur common stock is traded on the OTCQB Market, is illiquid and subject to price volatility unrelated to our operations.\nOur shares of common stock are currently traded on the OTCQB Market. Many institutional investors have investment policies which prohibit them from trading in stocks on the OTCQB Market. As a result, stocks traded on the OTCQB Market generally have limited trading volume and exhibit a wide spread between the bid/ask quotations than stock traded on national exchanges.\nIn addition, the stock market is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, including market perception of our ability to achieve our planned growth, our quarterly operating results, operating results of our competitors, trading volume in our common stock, changes in general conditions in the economy and the financial markets or other developments affecting our competitors or us. Certain of these factors can have a significant effect on the market price for our stock for reasons that are unrelated to our operating performance.\nThe application of the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules to our common stock could limit the trading and liquidity of the common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs long as the trading price of our common stock is below $5.00 per share, the open-market trading of our common stock will be subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules, unless we otherwise qualify for an exemption from the \u201cpenny stock\u201d definition. The \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules impose additional sales practice requirements on certain broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with net assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together with their spouse). These regulations, if they apply, require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the associated risks. Under these regulations, certain brokers who recommend such securities to persons other than established customers or certain accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination regarding such a purchaser and receive such purchaser\u2019s written agreement to a transaction prior to sale. These regulations may have the effect of limiting the trading activity of our common stock, reducing the liquidity of an investment in our common stock and increasing the transaction costs for sales and purchases of our common stock as compared to other securities.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.\nFrom time to time, certain of our shareholders may be eligible to sell some or all of their shares of common stock pursuant to Rule 144, promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144 as in effect as of the date of this Form 10-K, a shareholder (or shareholders whose shares are aggregated) who has satisfied the applicable holding period and is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of sale, or at any time during the three months preceding a sale, may sell their shares of common stock. Any substantial sale, or cumulative sales, of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to any resale prospectus may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nWe expect volatility in the price of our common stock, which may subject us to securities litigation.\nIf established, the market for our common stock may be characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nA stockholder group holds a majority of the outstanding common stock of the company and is able to effectively control our management and operations, and control by this group may create conflicts of interest.\nA group consisting of Dr. Samuel Herschkowitz, Josh Kornberg (who is our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chairman of the Board), SOK Partners, LLC and Atlantic Partners Alliance, currently owns more than 1.7 million shares of our outstanding common stock, representing approximately 51% of our voting power. As a result, this group controls the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including any future merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Further, this group indirectly controls our management through the power to elect and remove any members of the Board of Directors. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders. As a result, the return on your investment in our common stock through the market price of our common stock or ultimate sale of our business could be adversely affected. Further, conflicts of interest may arise with respect to the interpretation, continuation, renewal or enforcement of our agreements with the members of this group and their affiliates, including the agreements described under \u201cItem 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\u201d The resolution of any such conflict in favor of any member of this group or any of their affiliates may materially harm our results of operations and the value of your shares of common stock.\nOur Board of Directors\u2019 ability to issue undesignated preferred stock and the existence of anti-takeover provisions may depress the value of our common stock.\nOur authorized capital includes 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Of this amount, 20,550 shares have been designated as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and the remaining authorized shares are undesignated preferred stock. Our Board of Directors has the power to issue any or all of the shares of undesignated preferred stock, including the authority to establish one or more series and to fix the powers, preferences, rights and limitations of such class or series, without seeking stockholder approval. Further, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law regarding \u201cbusiness combinations.\u201d We may, in the future, consider adopting additional anti-takeover measures. The authority of our Board to issue undesignated stock and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, as well as any future anti-takeover measures adopted by us, may, in certain circumstances, delay, deter or prevent takeover attempts and other changes in control of the company not approved by our Board of Directors. As a result, our stockholders may lose opportunities to dispose of their shares at favorable prices generally available in takeover attempts or that may be available under a merger proposal and the market price, voting and other rights of the holders of common stock may also be affected.\nSince our inception, a majority of our shares and other securities have been issued in violation of the preemptive rights of existing shareholders, which could result in claims against us.\nIn 2013, it was brought to the attention of our management and board of directors that our company was subject to preemptive rights prior to its reincorporation in Delaware. The Minnesota Business Corporation Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) provides such rights to shareholders of a corporation, unless the corporation\u2019s articles of incorporation \u201copt out\u201d and deny them. Our company\u2019s articles of incorporation never denied preemptive rights or mentioned them in any way. Since our inception in 2002, our company has issued shares of common stock and other equity securities on numerous occasions to raise capital and for other purposes and, to our knowledge; we have never complied with the Minnesota preemptive rights statute in connection with such issuances. On December 16, 2013, the reincorporation merger became effective. From that date, stockholders no longer have preemptive rights relating to any future issuances of securities. As described in our Form 10-Q report for the quarter ended September 30, 2013 in Part II, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d in connection with previous issuances of securities, we may be subject to the claims of previous and current shareholders based on violations of their preemptive rights; the risk and magnitude of these claims are uncertain, because there is little legal authority on the application of the Minnesota preemptive rights statute and if there are any future claims, we intend to vigorously defend based in part on numerous facts and circumstances described in such Form 10-Q report and other factors.. However, if current or former shareholders bring claims against the company for violations of preemptive rights, there can be no assurance that our company will not be liable for damages, the amount of which cannot be predicted. Further, in connection with any such claims, a court may grant other remedies that will have a material adverse effect on our company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations, or that will result in dilution to some existing shareholders.", "PERMNO": 15645, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "POAI"}
