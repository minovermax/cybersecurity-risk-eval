{"cik": "314489", "company": "FIRST BUSEY CORP /NV/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis section highlights the risks management believes could adversely affect our financial performance. Additional possible risks that could affect the Company adversely and cannot be predicted may arise at any time. Other risks that are immaterial at this time may also have an adverse impact on our future financial condition.\nEconomic and Market Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic created an economic recession and caused severe financial disruptions that adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 will continue to negatively affect business operations, financial condition, credit quality, and results of operations will depend on future developments that cannot be predicted, including the duration and scope of the pandemic. The direct or indirect impact on employees, customers, counterparties, and service providers, as well as other market participants, is likely to continue through a significant portion of 2021 as the world attempts to gain control over the virus. The impact that the virus continues to have on global markets, the economy, business restrictions, and employment is ongoing as a projected return to normal operating conditions is unknown.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has negatively affected a subset of our customers\u2019 businesses, and continued disruptions could result in increased risk of delinquencies; defaults; foreclosures and losses on our loans; declines in assets under management, affecting wealth management revenues; negative impacts on regional economic conditions resulting in declines in local loan demand, liquidity of loan guarantors, loan collateral (particularly in real estate), loan originations, and deposit availability; and negative impacts on the implementation of our growth strategy. Although governmental authorities have introduced a number of programs designed to soften the impact of COVID-19 on small businesses, once these programs expire our borrowers may not be able to satisfy their financial obligations. Until the pandemic subsides, we expect draws on lines of credit, reduced revenues in our businesses, and increased customer and client defaults.\nIn general, business activity, employment rates, income levels and other measures of economic activity have been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The speed and strength of any economic recovery from the pandemic is subject to a high degree of uncertainty, but is expected to be affected by further developments in the pandemic. Among other things, this will depend on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in our markets; the development, distribution, and supply of vaccines, therapies, and other public health initiatives to control the spread of the disease; the nature and size of federal economic stimulus, and other governmental efforts; and the possibility of additional state lockdown or stay-at-home orders in our markets in response to the recent surge in the number of COVID-19 cases.\nThe initial distribution of vaccines has been slow, and there may continue to be challenges with producing and distributing sufficient quantities of the vaccines. If the general public is unwilling or unable to access effective vaccines and therapies, this may also prolong the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, new variants of COVID-19 may increase the spread or severity of COVID-19 and previously developed vaccines and therapies may not be as effective against new COVID-19 variants.\nOverall, we believe that the economic impact from COVID-19 will be severe and could have a material and adverse impact on our business and result in significant losses in our loan portfolio, all of which would adversely and materially impact our earnings and capital. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on liquidity, and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and as a result, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change.\nConditions in the financial market and economic conditions, including conditions in the states in which it operates, generally may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s general financial performance is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where it operates and, in particular, the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services it offers. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters, or a combination of these or other factors.\nThe Company currently conducts its banking operations in downstate Illinois; suburban Chicago, Illinois; the St. Louis, Missouri metropolitan area; central Indiana; and southwest Florida. Economic conditions within Busey\u2019s markets were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in significant increases in unemployment, economic decline, partial business shutdowns, operational uncertainty, and significant impact to certain industry sectors. The financial condition of the State of Illinois, in which the largest portion of the Company\u2019s customer base resides, is characterized with low credit ratings, pension under-funding, budget deficits, and lower job growth rates than most of the country. The Company operates in markets with significant university and healthcare presence, which rely heavily on state and federal funding and contracts. Payment delays by the State of Illinois to its vendors and government-sponsored entities, as well as potential federal changes to healthcare laws, could affect the Company\u2019s primary market areas, which could in turn adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The partial shutdown of colleges and universities across the state may also impact businesses heavily reliant on the colleges and universities for revenue generation. Recent downturns in local operating markets where banking operations occur could result in a decrease in demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, an increase in loan delinquencies and defaults, high or increased levels of problem assets and foreclosures, and reduced wealth management fees resulting from lower asset values.\nMarket volatility and changes in interest rates could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nChanges in interest rates could affect the level of assets and liabilities held on the Company\u2019s balance sheet and the revenue that the Company earns from net interest income, as earnings and profitability depend significantly on our net interest income. Net interest income represents the difference between interest income and fees earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, including the FOMC. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest the Company receives on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities. In addition, a rise in interest rates could result in decreased demand for first mortgages as well as mortgage refinancing, activities which have historically contributed to a significant portion of the Company\u2019s mortgage revenue. Furthermore, if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and investment securities, the Company\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Finally, when interest rates rise, competition for deposits often increases, which can lead to a change in the Company\u2019s funding mix and cost of funding. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds rate and announced a $700.0 billion quantitative easing program in response to the expected economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the Federal Reserve reduced the interest it pays on excess reserves. Reductions in interest rates, especially if prolonged, are likely to continue to have an adverse effect our net interest income and margins and our profitability. In December 2020, the FOMC held the target rate at its effective floor of 0.00-0.25% with panelists projecting the target rate to remain at these levels through 2021 and potentially 2022. The impact of the prolonged low rates will continue to\naffect rate spreads and return on earning assets. Although the FOMC has not indicated it would further reduce rates to a negative position, the potential for further adjustments that would take interest rates to below 0%, or effectively below 0%, cannot be ruled out. If rates were further reduced, it could have a materially adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s wealth management business may also be negatively impacted by changes in general economic conditions and the conditions in the financial and securities markets, which could affect the values of assets held under care. Management contracts generally provide for fees payable for wealth management services based on the market value of assets under care. Because most of the Company\u2019s contracts provide for a fee based on market values of securities, declines in securities prices may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations from this business. Market declines and reductions in the value of customers\u2019 wealth management accounts, could also result in the loss of wealth management customers, including those who are also banking customers.\nThe transition to an alternative reference rate could cause instability and have a negative effect on financial market conditions.\nLIBOR represents the interest rate at which banks offer to lend funds to one another in the international interbank market for short-term loans. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR rates after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021 and on November 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC issued supervisory guidance encouraging banks to cease entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. The ARRC has proposed that the SOFR is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to U.S. dollar-LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR. The ARRC has proposed a paced-market transition plan to SOFR from U.S. dollar-LIBOR and organizations are working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans relating to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR.\nContracts linked to LIBOR are vast in number and value, are intertwined with numerous financial products and services, and have diverse parties. Although the Company continues to actively work toward the transition away from LIBOR, the transition is both complex and challenging and the downstream effect of unwinding or transitioning such contracts could cause instability and negatively impact financial markets and individual institutions.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may increase our costs and impact our business, governance structure, financial condition, or results of operations.\nLaws, regulations, rules, policies, and regulatory interpretations governing the Company continue to evolve and will likely continue to change over time as Congress and various regulatory agencies react to adverse economic conditions or other matters. The recent change of the presidential administration and Congressional control could prompt new or revitalized financial services regulation. The extent and scope of potential financial regulations is hard to predict, but changes are expected to occur as leadership in various regulatory bodies is anticipated to shift in light of the new controlling party.\nMoreover, federal bank regulatory agencies have issued a steady stream of guidance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and have taken a number of unprecedented steps to help banks navigate the pandemic and mitigate its impact. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business activities as a result of new government and regulatory laws, policies, programs, and guidelines, as well as market reactions to such activities, remains uncertain but may ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nImplementation of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry may impact the profitability of the Company\u2019s business activities and may change certain business practices, including the ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans, and achieve satisfactory interest spreads, and could expose the Company to additional expense, including increased compliance costs. New appointments to the\nprimary banking regulatory agencies may affect monetary policy and interest rates, and changes in fiscal policy could affect broader patterns of trade and economic growth. Future legislation, regulation, and government policy could affect the banking industry as a whole, including our business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In addition, our results of operations also could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.\nThese rule and regulatory changes may also require the Company to invest significant management attention and resources so as to make necessary changes to operations in order to comply. In addition to the expense and uncertainty related to increased regulation, the financial services industry in recent years has faced more intense scrutiny from regulatory agencies in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels, particularly with respect to mortgage-related practices and other consumer compliance matters, and compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, anti-money laundering laws, and the USA PATRIOT Act, which focuses on money laundering in the form of terrorist financing. Federal law grants substantial enforcement powers to financial services\u2019 regulators including, among other things, the ability to assess significant civil or criminal monetary penalties, fines, or restitution; to issue cease and desist orders; and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations. These enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws or regulations and for unsafe or unsound practices. If the Company were the subject of an enforcement action, it could have an adverse impact on the Company.\nAs the Company continues to grow in asset size and complexity, regulatory expectations and scrutiny will likely increase and could have a potential impact on the Company\u2019s operations and business.\nThe Company has grown steadily over the past several years, increasing size through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions. As financial institutions grow, so do the expectations of regulatory agencies regarding the financial institution\u2019s ability to control for increasingly complex and sophisticated business operations. Certain regulations and laws have embedded asset thresholds that change regulatory expectations, have different financial statement impacts, require different committee and management compositions, or enhance certain reporting requirements. For example, as further discussed in the Supervision and Regulation section, the Dodd-Frank Act included a number of requirements that trigger when a banking entity crosses over $10.0 billion in assets. The Company has anticipated crossing the $10.0 billion threshold for some time, and it did so in 2020.\nOn November 20, 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies announced an Interim Final Rule, providing temporary relief for certain community banking organizations related to certain regulations and reporting requirements as a result of growth in size from the COVID-19 response. Programs, including the PPP, caused many community banking organizations to experience rapid and unexpected increases in size, which generally are expected to be temporary. Under the interim rule, which applies to financial institutions with less than $10 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2019, community banks that have crossed a relevant threshold will have until 2022 to either reduce their size or prepare for new regulatory and reporting standards. Asset growth in 2020 or 2021 will not trigger new regulatory requirements for the banks until January 1, 2022. The Company will be provided relief under this rule with respect to the interchange revenue impacts of Durbin. There is potential that changes in future regulatory expectations could impact the business operationally, strategically, or financially.\nLaws impacting cannabis-related businesses in Illinois may have an impact on the Company\u2019s operations and risk profile.\nThe Controlled Substances Act makes it illegal under federal law to manufacture, distribute, or dispense marijuana. Starting January 1, 2020, however, the Illinois Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act began permitting adults to legally purchase marijuana for recreational use from licensed dispensaries. It is Busey Bank\u2019s current practice to avoid knowingly providing banking products or services to entities or individuals that: (i) directly or indirectly manufacture, distribute, or dispense marijuana or hemp products, or those who have a significant financial interest in such entities; and (ii) derive a material amount of revenue from providing products or services to, or other involvement with, such entities. Busey Bank is taking reasonable measures, including appropriate new account screening and customer due diligence measures, to ensure that existing and potential customers do not engage in any such activities. Nonetheless, the shift in Illinois law is increasing the number of direct and indirect cannabis-related businesses in Illinois, and therefore increasing the likelihood that Busey Bank could interact with such businesses, as well as their owners and employees.\nSuch interactions could create additional legal, regulatory, strategic, and reputational risk to Busey Bank and the Company.\nCredit and Lending Risks\nHeightened credit risk associated with lending activities may result in insufficient loan loss provisions, which could have material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThere are risks in making any loan, including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers, risks of nonpayment, risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and cash flows available to service debt, and risks resulting from economic and market conditions. The Company attempts to reduce its credit risk through loan application approval procedures, monitoring the concentration of loans within specific industries and geographic locations, and periodic independent reviews of outstanding loans by its loan review and audit departments as well as external parties. However, while such procedures help reduce risks, they cannot be expected to completely eliminate the Company\u2019s credit risks. Borrowers may experience difficulties in repaying their loans for any of a variety of reasons resulting in a rise in the level of nonperforming loans, charge-offs, delinquencies, and/or a need for increases in the provision for loan losses. When economic conditions decline, as they have during the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in non-performing loans, charge-offs, and delinquencies become more likely.\nThe Company estimates and establishes reserves for loan losses and maintains them at a level considered adequate by management to absorb probable loan losses based on a continual analysis of the Company\u2019s portfolio and market environment. These reserves represent the Company\u2019s estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and are based upon other relevant information available.\nIn 2016, the FASB published CECL, which requires recording loss estimates for the life of the instrument for loans, a change from the 40-year standard in which losses are recorded under the \u201cincurred loss\u201d concept. Adoption of CECL in 2020 resulted in additional reserves being set aside to protect against future credit losses. Although management believes the reserves are adequate to absorb losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible, management cannot guarantee that additional provisions for credit losses will not be required in the future.\nNon-performing assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition and could result in further losses in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s non-performing assets adversely affect its net income in various ways. While the Company pays interest expense to fund non-performing assets, it does not record interest income on non-accrual loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting its income and returns on assets and equity. In addition, loan administration costs increase, and the Company\u2019s efficiency ratio is adversely affected. When the Company takes collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, it is required to mark the collateral to its then-fair market value, which, when compared to the outstanding balance of the loan, may result in a loss. Non-performing loans and other real estate owned also increase the Company\u2019s risk profile and the capital its regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks. The resolution of non-performing assets requires significant time commitments from management, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. Although it is hard to fully predict the affect the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the Company\u2019s asset quality, it\u2019s performance may be adversely affected if it experiences increases in non-performing loans and non-performing assets in the future.\nFederal regulatory agencies, in consultation with FASB, issued updated guidance on March 22, 2020 for classifying loans as TDRs, which allowed banks to modify loans of customers stressed by COVID-19 without having to classify the loan as a TDR. While this updated guidance provided temporary relief for both borrowers and banks, these loan modifications may not be sufficient to keep the assets the Company holds from deteriorating if the duration of the pandemic and subsequent business restrictions are prolonged.\nConcentrations of credit and market risk could increase the potential for significant losses.\nThe Company may have higher credit risk, or experience higher credit losses, to the extent its loans are concentrated by loan type, industry segment, borrower type, or geographic location of the borrower or collateral. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is made up of mortgage, commercial, and industrial loans, and secured by real estate. Thus, deterioration in economic conditions or real estate values could result in higher credit costs and losses to the Company. The global pandemic in 2020 significantly impacted both global and domestic markets and economies as shutdowns and restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus affected several different business sectors. Several sectors have been impacted significantly and have both direct and indirect impacts from associated businesses. For example, in-person dining and shopping restrictions significantly impacted cash flows for these entities, which could also impact several retail CRE and rental space borrowers from the lack of cash flows. The Company has taken additional steps to quantify the potential risk and impacted industries that are likely to experience the highest stress to cash flows and pose higher potential default risk.\nThe Company\u2019s commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, which the Company requires whenever appropriate on commercial loans. As a result, in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing other loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise, and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. As a result of the larger average size of each commercial loan, as well as collateral that is generally less readily-marketable, losses incurred on a small number of commercial loans could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s loans are collateralized by real estate. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the area in which the real estate is located. Adverse changes in the economy affecting real estate values and liquidity generally, and in markets in which the Company has banking operations, could significantly impair the value of property pledged as collateral on loans and affect the Company\u2019s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure without a loss or additional losses. Collateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan which would result in losses.\nAs a participating lender in the PPP, the Company is subject to additional risks of litigation from its customers or other parties regarding the processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nSince the opening of the PPP in March 2020, several banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP and claims related to agent fees. The Company may be exposed to the risk of similar litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached the banks regarding PPP loans, concerning their processes and procedures used in processing applications for PPP loans. If any such litigation is filed against us and is not resolved in a manner favorable to us, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect our reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs, or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also have credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Company, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to ambiguity in the laws, rules, and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP loan. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by us, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us.\nCredit risk associated with concentration of securities in the Company\u2019s investment portfolio may increase the potential for loss.\nThe Company\u2019s investment portfolio consists, in part, of securities issued by government or government sponsored agencies and non-government entities. A downturn in the financial condition of the issuers, the performance of the underlying collateral, or the financial condition of the individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities could create results such as rating agency downgrades of the securities and default by issuers or individual mortgagors. Any of the foregoing factors could result in realized losses, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nReal estate construction, land acquisition and development loans are based upon estimates of costs and values associated with the complete project. These estimates may be inaccurate, and the Company may be exposed to significant losses on loans for these projects.\nConstruction, land acquisition, and development loans involve additional risks because funds are advanced upon the security of the project, which is of uncertain value prior to its completion, and costs may exceed realizable values in declining real estate markets. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs and the realizable market value of the completed project, and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. As a result, construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If the Company\u2019s appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be overstated or market values or rental rates decline, there may be inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project. If the Company is forced to foreclose on a project prior to or at completion due to a default, there can be no assurance that it will be able to recover all of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. In addition, the Company may be required to fund additional amounts to complete the project and may have to hold the property for an unspecified period of time while it attempts to dispose of it.\nCapital and Liquidity Risks\nThe Company is required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, and if it fails to maintain sufficient capital, whether as a result of losses, inability to raise additional capital, or otherwise, its financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations, as well as its ability to maintain regulatory compliance would be adversely affected.\nFirst Busey and Busey Bank must meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. The Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, when and if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions, and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry and market condition, and governmental activities, many of which are outside the Company\u2019s control, and on its financial condition and performance. Accordingly, the Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to the Company. If it fails to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements, its financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to continue to maintain capital ratios in excess of the amounts necessary to be considered \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d for bank regulatory purposes could affect customer confidence, its ability to grow, its costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, its ability to pay dividends to its stockholders on outstanding stock, its ability to make acquisitions, and its business, results of operations, and financial condition. Furthermore, under FDIC rules, if the Company ceases to meet the requirements to be considered a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d institution for bank regulatory purposes, the interest rates it pays on deposits and its ability to accept, renew, or rollover deposits, particularly brokered deposits, may be restricted.\nLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLiquidity is essential to the Company\u2019s business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans, and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on liquidity. The Company\u2019s primary sources of funds consist of deposits and funds from sales of investment securities, investment maturities and sales, and cash from operations. Additional liquidity is available through repurchase agreements, brokered deposits, and the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB. Access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize the Company\u2019s activities or on terms that are acceptable to the Company could be impaired by factors that affect it directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nDuring periods of economic turmoil, the financial services industry and the credit markets generally may be materially and adversely affected by significant declines in asset values and depressed levels of liquidity. These and other factors could negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions with other financial institutions and lead to market-wide liquidity problems, loss of depositor, creditor, and counterparty confidence, which could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions. Although the Company is not currently experiencing liquidity stress, pandemic-related market conditions remain uncertain. Any decline in available funding and/or capital could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet its expenses, pay dividends to its stockholders, or meet deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on its liquidity, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could negatively affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be negatively affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and losses of depositor, creditor, and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions. The Company could experience growth as a result of the difficulties or failures of other banks or government-sponsored financial institutions, which would increase its funding needs.\nCompetitive and Strategic Risks\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research reports about us, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our stock, or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. If there is limited or no securities or industry analyst coverage of us, the market price for our stock would be negatively impacted. Moreover, if any of the analysts who elect to cover us downgrade our common stock, provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, or if our operating results or prospects do not meet their expectations, the market price of our common stock may decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nThe Company faces strong competition from financial service companies and other companies that offer banking and wealth management services, which could harm its business.\nThe Company currently conducts its banking operations in downstate Illinois; suburban Chicago, Illinois; the St. Louis, Missouri, metropolitan area; central Indiana; and southwest Florida. In addition, the Company currently offers fiduciary and wealth management services, which account for a significant portion of its non-interest income. Many competitors offer the same, or a wider variety of, banking and wealth management services within the Company\u2019s market areas. These competitors include national banks, regional banks, and other community banks. The Company also faces\ncompetition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loan institutions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and online lenders, and other financial intermediaries. In addition, a number of out-of-state financial intermediaries have opened production offices or otherwise solicit deposits in the Company\u2019s market areas. Also, technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks or financial technology companies, as well as other large technology corporations, to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. For example, customers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Customers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. Increased competition in the Company\u2019s markets may result in reduced loans, deposits, and commissions and brokers\u2019 fees, as well as reduced net interest margin and profitability. Ultimately, the Company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. If the Company is unable to attract and retain banking and wealth management customers, it may be unable to grow its loan and deposit portfolios or its wealth management commissions, which could adversely affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRapid speed of disruptive innovations enabled by new and emerging technologies and/or other market forces may outpace the Company\u2019s ability to compete.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving clients, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Ultimately, if we fall behind in our ability to be adaptive and innovative, sustaining customer loyalty and retention may be increasingly difficult as a result of evolving customer preferences and/or demographic shifts in our existing customer base.\nOur strategy of pursuing acquisitions exposes us to financial, execution, and operational risks that could negatively affect us.\nTo help us fulfill our strategic objectives and enhance our earnings, part of our strategy is to supplement organic growth by acquiring other financial institutions in our market areas and in nearby markets. On January 19, 2021, we announced the execution of a merger agreement for the acquisition of CAC, the holding company for GSB. As our capital position and asset quality allow, we may continue to supplement organic growth through acquisitions, as we have in the past. There are risks associated with acquisition strategies, including the following:\n\u25cf We are exposed to potential asset and credit quality risks and unknown or contingent liabilities of the banks or businesses we acquire. If these issues or liabilities exceed our estimates, our earnings and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\n\u25cf Prices at which acquisitions can be made fluctuate with market conditions. We have experienced times during which acquisitions could not be made in specific markets at prices our management considered acceptable and expect that we will experience this condition in the future in one or more markets.\n\u25cf The acquisition of other entities generally requires integration of systems, procedures, and personnel of the acquired entity in order to make the transaction economically feasible. This integration process is complicated and time consuming and can also be disruptive to the customers of the acquired business. If the integration process is not conducted successfully and with minimal effect on the acquired business and its customers, we may not realize the anticipated economic benefits of particular acquisitions within the expected time frame, and we may lose customers or employees of the acquired business. Furthermore, the integration of personnel can be challenging and the likelihood of turnover of personnel from acquired institutions presents potential risks to both operational efficiency as well as customer retention. The Company may also experience greater than anticipated customer losses even if the integration process is successful.\n\u25cf We are subject to due diligence expenses which may not result in an acquisition.\n\u25cf To finance an acquisition, we may borrow funds, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or issue capital stock to the sellers in an acquisition or to third-parties to raise capital, which could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders.\n\u25cf The time period in which anticipated benefits of a merger are fully realized may take longer than anticipated, or we may be unsuccessful in realizing the anticipated benefits from mergers and future acquisitions.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may seek to implement new lines of business or offer new products, services, or delivery channels within existing lines of business in our current markets or new markets. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are either highly competitive or, conversely, not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible, which could in turn have a material negative effect on our operating results.\nAccounting and Tax Risks\nFinancial statements are created, in part, by estimates and assumptions and methods used by management, which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is impacted by accounting principles, policies, and guidelines. Some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of assets or liabilities and financial results. Certain accounting policies are critical and require management to make difficult, subjective, and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. If such estimates or assumptions underlying the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements are incorrect, the Company may experience material losses.\nOne such assumption and estimate is the valuation analysis of its goodwill and other intangible assets. Although the Company\u2019s analysis does not indicate impairments exist, the Company is required to perform additional impairment assessments on at least an annual basis, and perhaps more frequently, which could result in further impairment charges. Any future goodwill or other intangible assets impairment charges, based on the current balances or future balances arising out of acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations by reducing net income or increasing net losses. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic could contribute to a sustained decline in our stock price or the occurrence of what management would deem to be a triggering event that could, under certain circumstances, cause management to perform impairment testing on our goodwill and other intangible assets that could result in an impairment charge being recorded for that period.\nThe Company is subject to changes in accounting principles, policies, or guidelines.\nPeriodically, agencies such as the FASB or the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s Financial Statements. These changes are beyond the Company\u2019s control, can be difficult to predict, and could materially impact how the Company reports its financial condition and results of operations. Changes in these standards are continuously occurring and the implementation of such changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax law and may not realize tax benefits which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws at national or state levels could have an effect on the Company\u2019s short-term and long-term earnings. Tax law changes are both difficult to predict and are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Changes in tax laws could affect the Company\u2019s earnings as well as its customers\u2019 financial positions, or both.\nDeferred tax assets are designed to reduce subsequent period\u2019s income tax expense and arise, in part, as a result of net loss carry-overs, and other book accounting to tax accounting differences including expected credit losses, stock-based compensation, and deferred compensation. Such items are recorded as assets when it is anticipated the tax consequences will be recorded in future periods. A valuation allowance is established against a deferred tax asset when it is unlikely the future tax effects will be realized. Significant judgment by management about matters that are by nature uncertain is required to record a deferred tax asset and establish a valuation allowance.\nIn evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, the Company estimates future taxable income based on management forecasts and tax planning strategies that may be available to us. While the Company has determined that no valuation allowance is currently required for any deferred tax assets, if future events differ significantly from our current forecasts, it may need to establish a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets, which would have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods prior to the expiration of the related net operating losses and may be limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nFurther, the Company\u2019s investments in certain tax-advantaged projects may not generate returns as anticipated and may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial results. The Company invests in certain tax-advantaged projects promoting affordable housing, community development and other community revitalization projects. The Company\u2019s investments in these projects are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits, and other tax benefits, over specified time periods. The Company is subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits, which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level, will fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and will not be able to be realized. The possible inability to realize these tax credit and other tax benefits can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial results. The ultimate realization of the tax credits and other tax benefits depends upon having sufficient taxable income and on many factors outside of the Company\u2019s control, including changes in the applicable tax code and the ability of the projects to be completed.\nOperational Risks\nThe Company\u2019s framework for managing risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and loss. It has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject, compliance risk and reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations. Risks may exist, or emerge in the future, that have not been appropriately identified or anticipated. As it continues to grow, the Company\u2019s ability to successfully identify and manage the risks it faces is an important factor that can significantly impact results. If its risk management framework proves ineffective, the Company could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company relies on the integrity of its operating systems and employees, and those of third-parties, and certain failures of such systems or error by employees or customers could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nCommunications and information systems are essential to conduct the Company\u2019s business, as it uses such systems to manage customer transactions and relationships, the general ledger, and deposits, loans, and investments. However, the computer systems and network infrastructure the Company uses could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems as\noperations are dependent upon the protection of computer equipment against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security events.\nIn addition, the Company outsources certain processing functions to third-party providers. If third-party providers encounter difficulties or if the Company has difficulty in communicating with them, the ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions may be affected and business operations may be adversely impacted. If third-party providers are unable to meet service expectations, experience system or processing failure, or incur disruptions affecting operations, results could adversely impact the Company. While the Company follows certain due diligence procedures in reviewing and vetting its third-parties, it cannot control their actions.\nAlthough the Company has procedures in place to prevent or limit the effects of any of these potential problems and intends to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such occurrences, technology-related disruptions, failures, and cybersecurity risks are a constant threat, both for the Company and for the third-parties it works with. Therefore, it cannot guarantee that these measures will be successful. Any failure, interruption in, or breach in security of, its computer systems and network infrastructure, as well as those of its customers engaging in internet banking activities or electronic funds transfers, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nSimilarly, the Company is reliant upon its employees. Such dependencies create risks for potential losses resulting from employee errors, breakdowns in process or control, failures to properly execute change management, negligence, or a number of other factors outside the Company\u2019s control. The Company maintains a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors, customer or employee fraud, and other disruptions which might impact its business. In addition, the Company\u2019s Internal Audit department routinely reviews operations and high-risk areas for error, deficient controls, and failure to adhere to policy.\nPotential legal actions, fines, and civil money penalties could arise as results of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity.\nThe implementation of a remote workforce to help mitigate potential COVID-19 spread caused a rapid shift in operations across several business lines and departments requiring processes and the delivery of services to be amended and adopted rapidly while in a stressed environment.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the ability of our employees and clients to engage in banking and other financial transactions in the geographic area in which we operate and could create widespread business continuity issues for us. We also could be adversely affected if key personnel or a significant number of employees were to become unavailable due to the effects and restrictions of an outbreak or escalation of the COVID-19 pandemic in our market area, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, there is no assurance that such plans and safeguards will be effective.\nThe Company implemented an initiative to deploy a remote workforce when able to help combat against the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The deployment of the remote workforce required policies and procedures to be amended while also still serving the needs and demand of the community. The implementation of teleworking strategies using virtual private networks, virtual conferencing services, and telecommunication technologies can increase insider risk, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and other operational exposures. Cyber attackers have taken advantage of the pandemic to create campaigns to leverage individuals fears and uncertainties. Industry trends in ransomware, phishing, and other intrusion methods have increased and will continue to pose increased risk while the Company\u2019s operations remain partially remote.\nA breach in the security of the Company\u2019s systems could disrupt its businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage its reputation, and create significant financial and legal exposure for the Company.\nAlthough the Company devotes significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade systems and processes designed to protect the security of its computer systems, software, networks, and other technology assets, these measures do not provide absolute security. Several healthcare institutions, government agencies, technology providers, and other companies have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks, and other means.\nThreats to security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other third-parties, their personnel, and their use of subcontractors. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms the Company and its third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. Such cyber incidents may go undetected for a period of time. An inability by our third-party providers, and their third-party providers, known as \u201csupply chain risk,\u201d to anticipate, detect, or adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in a number of negative events, including losses to us or our clients, loss of business or clients, damage to our reputation, the incurrence of additional expenses, additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties, or exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects.\nThe Company also faces risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card and debit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding the Company\u2019s customers through various third-parties, including merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, payment card networks, and its processors. Cyber-attacks or other breaches, whether affecting the Company or others, could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in reduced use of payment cards and increased costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nPenetration or circumvention of the Company\u2019s security systems could result in serious negative consequences for the Company, including significant disruption of the Company\u2019s operations, misappropriation of confidential information of the Company or that of its customers or employees, or damage to computers or systems of the Company and those of its customers and counterparties. Such events could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Company or its customers, loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s security measures, customer dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, all of which would adversely affect the Company.\nThese risks have increased for all financial institutions globally as new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies, including mobile devices, to conduct financial and other business transactions, and the sophistication and activities of malicious individuals and organizations have increased. Despite the Company\u2019s significant investment in security resources and its continued efforts to prevent or limit the effects of potential threats, it is possible that the Company may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventative measures against all security incidents.\nCustomer or employee misconduct or fraud may affect operations, result in significant financial loss, and have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s reputation.\nMisconduct by employees and customers could include hiding unauthorized activities, conducting improper or unauthorized activities, or improper use of confidential information. Customer or other outsiders may also attempt to perpetuate fraud or scams in the form of identity theft, money laundering, fraudulent or altered deposits, or use of counterfeit instruments, as a few examples. The Company also faces fraud risk associated with the origination of loans, including the intentional misstatement of information in property appraisals or other underwriting documentation provided to it by customers or by third-parties. Customers may expose the Company to certain fraud risks associated with the compromise of their computing systems or accounts, as well.\nBoth the number and sophistication level of attempted fraudulent transactions are increasing. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence of fraud, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain management and key personnel may affect future growth and earnings and legislation imposing new compensation restrictions could adversely affect its ability to do so.\nMuch of the Company\u2019s success and growth has been influenced strongly by its ability to attract and retain management experienced in banking and financial services and familiar with the communities in its market areas. The Company\u2019s ability to retain executive officers, current management teams, lending and retail banking officers, and administrative staff of its subsidiaries continues to be important to the successful implementation of its strategy. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to retain key personnel at acquired financial institutions is vitally important to the Company\u2019s strategy to grow through mergers and acquisitions. Also critical is the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain qualified staff with the appropriate level of experience and knowledge about its market areas so as to implement its community-based operating strategy. The unexpected loss of services of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nDamage resulting from negative publicity could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and adversely impact its business and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to attract and maintain customers, investors, and employees is contingent upon maintaining trust. Negative public opinion could result from the Company\u2019s actual or alleged conduct in a number of activities, including, but not limited to, employee misconduct, a failure or perceived failure to deliver appropriate standards of service and quality or to treat customers fairly, faulty lending practices, compliance failures, security breaches, corporate governance, sharing or inadequate protection of customer information, failure to comply with laws or regulations, and actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to that conduct. The results of such actual or alleged misconduct could include customer dissatisfaction, inability to attract potential acquisition prospects, litigation, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which could lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. No assurance can be made, despite the cost or efforts made by the Company to address the issues arising from reputational harm, that results could not adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of terrorism or war, widespread disease or pandemics, or other adverse external events could significantly impact the Company\u2019s business.\nAs the Company\u2019s operating and market footprint continues to grow, severe weather, natural disasters, acts of terrorism or war, widespread disease or pandemics, as is currently being experienced, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business. The Company\u2019s current footprint poses a wide variety of potential adverse events that could impact the Company in various ways. In addition, such events could affect the stability of the Company\u2019s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. The occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operation.", "PERMNO": 86382, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BUSE"}
