{"cik": "727510", "company": "ENZON PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have made forward-looking statements in an attempt to better enable the reader to understand our future prospects and make informed judgments. By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to numerous factors that may influence outcomes or even prevent their eventual realization. Such factors may be external to the Company and entirely outside of our control.\nWe cannot guarantee that our assumptions and expectations will be correct. Failure of events to be achieved or of certain underlying assumptions to prove accurate could cause actual results to vary materially from past results and those anticipated or projected. We do not intend to update forward-looking statements.\nCertain risks and uncertainties are discussed below. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Accordingly, you should not consider this recitation to be complete.\nRisks Relating to the Company and its Operations\nOur sources of revenue are limited and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future; unanticipated liabilities and expenses could adversely affect our ability to continue operations or make expected distributions.\nWe have incurred losses in the current period and have limited sources of revenues. We have been informed by Merck that there will likely be no or minimal additional sales of PegIntron and we would likely receive no further royalties, although we may remain potentially liable to Merck for product returns and rebates. Based on current estimates, we do not expect any liability for those returns and rebates to be material. Moreover, our right to receive royalty revenues from other products is limited and we currently do not intend to acquire new sources of royalty revenues. For those remaining existing or potential sources of royalty revenue, our licensees may be unable to maintain regulatory approvals for currently licensed products or obtain regulatory approvals for new products. Safety issues could also result in the failure to maintain regulatory approvals or decrease revenues.\nWhile we have substantially reduced our operating expenses in anticipation of the decline in revenues - ceasing our research and development activities, eliminating our workforce in favor of independent contractors, and discontinuing our significant lease commitments - we may incur unanticipated liabilities or expenses, including expenses to defend unasserted product liability claims or greater than expected liabilities for PegIntron. Any such expenses or liabilities could impact the availability of assets that we expect to use to fund future operations or adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to shareholders upon a liquidation of the Company.\nWe have outsourced all corporate functions, which makes us more dependent on third parties to perform these corporate functions.\nWe have outsourced all corporate functions, which makes us more dependent on third parties for the performance of these functions. To the extent that we are unable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities, retain key officers as consultants, maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, establish and maintain agreements with competent third-party contractors on terms that are acceptable to us, or effectively manage the work performed by any retained third-party contractors, our ability to manage the operations and planned liquidation of our business effectively could be compromised.\nRisks Relating to the Proposed Dissolution and Liquidation\nThe proposed dissolution and liquidation of the Company may not be completed in a timely manner or at all.\nOn February 4, 2016, our Board adopted a Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution, pursuant to which we would, subject to obtaining requisite stockholder approval, be liquidated and dissolved in accordance with Sections 280 and 281(a) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. In approving the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution, our Board had considered, among other factors, our ability to obtain no-action relief from the SEC to suspend certain of our reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the anticipated cost savings if such relief is granted by the SEC. After further consideration, our Board determined that it would be fair, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to postpone seeking stockholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution until a later time to be determined by our Board.\nFrom time to time, our Board reviews our status and prospects in deciding on the timing of our dissolution and liquidation pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution. If our Board determines to seek stockholder approval of such plan and such plan is approved by our stockholders and implemented by us, it is expected that our corporate existence will continue for the purpose of winding up our business and affairs for at least three years. We have forecasted minimal or no royalty or milestone revenues for the foreseeable future. In light of the uncertainty as to whether any of the milestones under the Micromet Marketing Agreement would be achieved, this forecast assumes that we would not receive any milestone or royalty payments under the Micromet Marketing Agreement.\nThe amount we distribute to our stockholders as liquidating distributions, if any, pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution may be substantially less than estimated.\nAt present, we cannot determine with certainty the amount of any liquidating distribution to our stockholders if the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution is implemented. The amount of cash ultimately distributed to our stockholders in any liquidating distribution pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution depends on, among other things, the amount of our liabilities, obligations and expenses and claims against us, and the amount of the reserves that we establish during the liquidation process. Estimates of these amounts may be inaccurate. Factors that could impact these estimates include the following: (i) if any of the estimates regarding the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution, including the expenses to satisfy outstanding obligations, liabilities and claims during the liquidation process, are inaccurate, (ii) if litigation is brought against us or our directors and officers, if unforeseen claims are asserted against us, we will have to defend or resolve such claims or establish a reasonable reserve before making distributions to our stockholders, (iii) if the estimates regarding the expenses to be incurred in the liquidation process, including expenses of personnel required and other operating expenses (including legal, accounting and other professional fees) necessary to dissolve and liquidate the Company, are inaccurate and (iv) if we continue to incur significant expenses related to ongoing reporting obligations.\nWe may not realize our deferred income tax assets.\nThe ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income, executing tax planning strategies, and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets. The valuation allowance may fluctuate as conditions change. Our ability to utilize net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards to offset our future taxable income and/or to recover previously paid taxes would be limited if we were to undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cIRC\u201d). In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d (within the meaning of Section 382 of the IRC) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d at any time over the testing period.\nAn ownership change under Section 382 of the IRC would establish an annual limitation to the amount of NOL carryforwards we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any single year. The application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our NOL carryforwards. There can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382. See Note 10 to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 in this document.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and may decline significantly as we wind down our business operations.\nHistorically, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range for a variety of reasons, including company specific factors and global and industry-wide conditions and events. In the future, the value of our common stock may be impacted by our decision to discontinue research and development activities, our declining royalty revenues, our ability to monetize our remaining assets, including our NOLs, and any unexpected liabilities or expenses that impact our continued operations or ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our shareholders.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQX market of the OTC Markets Group, Inc., which has a very limited trading market and, therefore, market liquidity for our common stock is low and our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares of our common stock may be limited.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQX market of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. and the quotation of our common stock on the OTCQX market does not assure that a liquid trading market exists or will develop. Stocks traded on the OTCQX market generally have very limited trading volume and exhibit a wider spread between the bid/ask quotations than stocks traded on national exchanges. Moreover, a significant number of institutional investors have investment policies that prohibit them from trading in stocks on the OTCQX marketplace. As a result, investors may find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations of the price of, our common stock. This significantly limits the liquidity of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not currently, and are not expected in the future to, meet the listing standards of any national exchange. We presently anticipate that our common stock will continue to be quoted on the OTCQX market. As a result, investors must bear the economic risk of holding their shares of our common stock for an indefinite period of time. In the future, our common stock could become subject to \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers and could further negatively impact market liquidity for our common stock and our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell their shares of our common stock.\nThe declaration of dividends is within the discretion of our Board, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law. Our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, our declining royalty revenues and our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations.\nIn April 2013, we announced that our Board intends to distribute excess cash, expected to arise from ongoing royalty revenues, in the form of periodic dividends to our stockholders. The declaration of dividends is within the discretion of our Board, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law, and, therefore, our Board could decide in the future not to declare dividends. In addition, our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, our future revenues from existing and any future royalties and/or milestone payments and our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations. Our future revenues from existing royalties have decreased sharply over the last several years and are expected to decline and eventually cease altogether due to eventual expirations over time of our right to receive royalties and milestones under the terms of our existing licensing arrangements. Therefore, we expect little or no future royalties from existing products for which we have the right to receive royalties. There is no assurance that we will have sufficient royalty or milestone revenues to be able to pay dividends in the future. Moreover, if we file a Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution, the applicable Delaware court may impose limitations on our ability to declare dividends prior to the final dissolution of the Company. Our inability to pay dividends could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware corporate law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include:\n\u2022 lack of a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022 the ability of our board to authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022 advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022 limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.\nThe provisions described above and provisions of Delaware corporate law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then current market price.\nOur previous Section 382 rights plan expired on April 30, 2017 and has not been replaced.", "PERMNO": 33137, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ENZN"}
