{"cik": "720154", "company": "Inotiv, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-12-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to many risks and uncertainties, which may affect our future financial performance or condition. If any of the events or circumstances described below occur, our business and financial performance or condition could be adversely affected, our actual results could differ materially from our expectations and the market value of our stock could decline. The risks and uncertainties discussed below are not the only ones we face. There may be additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material that may adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price have and may continue to be adversely affected by pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as the recent outbreak of COVID-19.\nOur business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and stock price have and may continue to be adversely affected by pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as the recent international outbreak of COVID-19. In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic, and the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency. The outbreak has resulted in governments around the world implementing stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, \u201cshelter in place\u201d and \u201cstay at home\u201d orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments, school closures, and other measures. In addition, governments and central banks in several parts of the world have enacted fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the impacts of COVID-19.\nAmong other impacts to date, we believe the outbreak has and may continue to negatively impact demand for our products, including Culex, in-vivo sampling systems. We had clients delay or postpone some large Service segment programs in the year, and we estimated that the impact on revenue in fiscal 2020 from program delays and postponements was approximately $2.0 million. There was no significant impact from program delays and postponements in fiscal 2021. The measures the Company has and may continue to take in response to the outbreak may also impact our business. In response to the outbreak the Company applied for and was granted a Paycheck Protection Program loan (the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d) in the aggregate amount of $5,051,282. On July 16, 2021, $4,850,665 of our PPP Loan was forgiven. The portion of the PPP Loan that was not forgiven, and any further borrowings, may result in increased leverage and interest expense. In\naddition, the pandemic has prompted the adoption of additional safety protocols, periods of remote operation for certain of our employees and other adjustments to our business practices.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 and preventive or protective actions taken by governmental authorities may continue to have a material adverse effect on our and our customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 respective operations, including with respect to the potential for business shutdowns or disruptions. The extent to which COVID-19 may continue to adversely impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable, depending upon the severity and duration of the outbreak and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain or mitigate its effects. Future financial impact cannot be estimated reasonably at this time, but may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business due to any resulting economic recession or depression and demand for our products and services. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of COVID-19 have caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets which has and may continue to adversely impact our stock price and our ability to access capital markets including to refinance existing obligations. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of exacerbating many of the other risks described herein or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial.\nRisks Related to the Industries we Serve\nWe depend on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.\nWe believe that due to the significant investment in facilities and personnel required to support drug development, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies look to outsource some or all of those services. By doing so, they can focus their resources on their core competency of drug discovery, while obtaining the outsourced services from a full-service provider like us. Our revenues depend greatly on the expenditures made by these pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in research and development. In some instances, companies in these industries are reliant on their ability to raise capital in order to fund their research and development projects and to compensate us for services rendered. Accordingly, economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries also affect our business. If companies in these industries were to reduce the number or scope of research and development projects they conduct or outsource, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nA reduction in research and development budgets at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may adversely affect our business.\nOur clients include researchers at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our ability to continue to grow and win new business depends in large part upon the ability and willingness of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to continue to spend on research and development and to purchase the products and outsource the services we provide. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets of these researchers and their organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, spending priorities and institutional budgetary policies, among other reasons. Our business could be adversely affected by any significant decrease in life sciences research and development expenditures by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Economic factors, industry trends and global pandemics, such as COVID-19, that affect our clients in these industries also affect our business.\nRisks Related to our Operations\nWe rely on a limited number of key clients, the importance of which may vary dramatically from year to year, and a loss of one or more of these key clients may adversely affect our operating results.\nFive clients accounted for approximately 20.5% of our total sales in fiscal 2021 and approximately 23.2% of our total sales in fiscal 2020. The loss of a significant amount of business from one or more of our major clients would materially and adversely affect our results of operations until such time, if ever, as we are able to replace the lost business. Significant clients or projects in any one period may not continue to be significant clients or projects in other periods. In any given year, there is a possibility that a single pharmaceutical company may account for a significant percentage of our\ntotal revenue or that our business may depend on one or more large projects. Since we do not have long-term contracts with most of our clients, the importance of a single client may vary dramatically from year to year as projects end and new projects begin. To the extent that we are dependent on any single client, we are indirectly subject to risks related to that client, including if such risks impede the client\u2019s ability to stay in business or otherwise to make timely payments to us.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe CRO services industry is highly competitive. We often compete for business not only with other CROs, but also with internal discovery and development departments within our client companies. The industry has historically been diverse with more than 1,000 CROs around the globe, ranging from small, regional niche laboratories up to global comprehensive service providers with tens of thousands of employees. As a result of competitive pressures, our industry experienced consolidation in recent years. This trend is likely to produce more competition among the larger companies for both clients and acquisition candidates. Offshore CROs have provided increasing competitive pressures, although we believe the pandemic has made Asian CROs a less attractive option for many western clients.\nThe majority of our clients\u2019 contracts can be terminated upon short notice.\nMost of our contracts for CRO services are terminable by the client upon 30 days\u2019 notice. Clients terminate or delay their contracts for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf products being tested fail to satisfy safety requirements;\n\u25cf products having undesired clinical results;\n\u25cf the client deciding to forego a particular study;\n\u25cf inability to enroll enough patients in the study;\n\u25cf inability to recruit enough investigators;\n\u25cf production problems causing shortages of the drug; and\n\u25cf actions by regulatory authorities.\nAlthough our contracts frequently entitle us to receive the costs of winding down the terminated projects, as well as all fees earned by us up to the time of termination, and some of our contracts entitle us to a termination fee, the loss, reduction in scope or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe may bear financial risk if we underprice our contracts or overrun cost estimates.\nSince some of our contracts are structured as fixed price or fee-for-service, we bear the financial risk if we initially underprice our contracts or otherwise overrun our cost estimates. Significant underpricing or cost overruns could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nProviding CRO services creates a risk of liability.\nWe could be held liable for errors and omissions in connection with the services we perform. In certain circumstances, we seek to manage our liability risk through contractual provisions with clients requiring indemnification by the clients or coverage under the clients\u2019 product liability insurance policies. The financial performance of our client indemnifying parties is not secured. Therefore, we bear the risk that the indemnifying party may not have the financial ability, or may otherwise fail, to fulfill its indemnification obligations or that the liability could exceed the amount of applicable client insurance, if any. In the event that we are unable to reach indemnification or insurance coverage arrangements with our clients to appropriately cover our potential losses, our insurance coverage may not adequately cover such losses. Relevant insurance coverage may also not always be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur business uses biological and hazardous materials, which could injure people or violate laws, resulting in liability that could adversely impact our financial condition and business.\nOur activities involve the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials, as well as hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages that result, and any liability could exceed our insurance coverage and ability to pay. Any contamination or injury could also damage our reputation, which is critical to obtaining new business. In addition, we are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations is significant and if changes are made to impose additional requirements, these costs could increase and have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur animal populations may suffer diseases that can damage our inventory, harm our reputation, result in decreased sales of our services or research products or result in other liability.\nIt is important that our animal populations be free of diseases, including infectious diseases. The presence of diseases can distort or compromise the quality of research results, can cause loss of animals in our inventory, can result in harm to humans or outside animal populations if the disease is not contained to animals in inventory, or can result in other losses. Such results could harm our reputation or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur products business depends on our intellectual property.\nOur products business depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents in various jurisdictions on our current and future technologies and products, to defend our patents and protect our trade secrets and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Our patents may be challenged by third parties and, if challenged, may not be held valid. In addition, technologies or products developed by us may be challenged by third parties owning relevant patent rights and, if challenged, could be found to infringe on those patent rights. The expense involved in patent litigation can be significant, even where challenges may lack merit. We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology, which subjects us to risk that others may independently develop or obtain similar products or technologies.\nRisks Related to our Financial Activities\nWe have experienced periods of losses and financial insecurity.\nThroughout our history we have experienced periods of financial losses and financial hardship. Our current efforts may not result in profitability, or if our efforts result in profits, such profits may not continue for any meaningful period of time. In order to finance our acquisition of Seventh Wave Laboratories, LLC\u2019s and Smithers Avanza\u2019s, Preclinical Research Service\u2019s, HistoTox Laboratories\u2019 and Bolder BioPATH\u2019s businesses and the expansion of BAS Evansville\u2019s and St. Louis\u2019 facilities, we have significantly increased our leverage. Sustained losses may result in our inability to service our financial obligations as they come due, including the additional indebtedness we have incurred to support our growth initiatives, or to meaningfully invest in our business.\nOur failure to comply with the terms of our existing credit agreement could result in an event of default that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf there were an event of default under our existing credit agreement, all amounts outstanding under that agreement could be due and payable immediately, which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. An event of default may occur should our assets or cash flow be insufficient to fully repay borrowings under our existing credit agreement, whether paid in the ordinary course or accelerated, or if we are unable to maintain compliance with relevant obligations thereunder, including financial and other covenants. Various risks and uncertainties, including those arising as a result of COVID-19, may impact our ability to comply with our obligations\nunder the existing credit agreement. Should the pandemic or other factors continue to negatively impact our business, those developments might cause us to fail to comply with the covenants under our existing credit agreement.\nIn connection with our acquisition of Seventh Wave Laboratories, LLC\u2019s and Smithers Avanza\u2019s, Preclinical Research Service\u2019s, HistoTox Laboratories\u2019 and Bolder BioPATH\u2019s businesses and the expansions of our facilities in Evansville, Indiana and St. Louis, we have significantly increased our level of indebtedness, as well as our ability to incur further indebtedness under relevant lines of credit. Our ability to service this indebtedness will depend, in part, on the success of our operations and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow therefrom.\nIn connection with the recent restatement of our financial statements, our management has concluded that certain of our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2021 due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting solely related to our accounting for the tax impact of acquisitions that qualify as stock transactions for tax purposes. If we are unable to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.\nManagement and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors concluded that it was appropriate to restate the Company\u2019s previously issued unaudited interim financial statements included in the Company\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2021, filed with the SEC on August 13, 2021, due to an error in accounting for certain tax attributes related to an acquisition completed by the Company in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. As part of such process, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, solely related to our accounting for the tax impact of acquisitions that qualify as stock transactions for tax purposes.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. We expect to take steps to remediate the material weakness, but there is no assurance that any remediation efforts will ultimately have the intended effects.\nIf we identify any new material weaknesses in the future, any such newly identified material weakness could limit our ability to prevent or detect a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In such case, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and our stock price may decline as a result. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to avoid potential future material weaknesses.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nChanges in government regulation or in practices relating to the pharmaceutical industry could change the demand for the services we provide.\nGovernmental agencies throughout the world, but particularly in the United States, strictly regulate the drug development process. Our business involves helping pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies comply with the regulatory drug approval process. Changes in regulation, such as a relaxation in regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures, or an increase in regulatory requirements that we may have difficulty satisfying, or that make our services less competitive, could substantially change the demand for our services. Also, if governments increase efforts to contain drug costs and pharmaceutical and biotechnology company profits from new drugs, our clients may spend less, or slow the pace of increased spending, on research and development.\nAny failure by us to comply with existing regulations could harm our reputation and operating results.\nAny failure on our part to comply with existing regulations could result in the termination of ongoing research or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities. For example, if we were to fail to properly monitor compliance with study protocols, the data collected could be disqualified. Under such circumstances, we may be contractually required to repeat a study at no further cost to the client, but at substantial cost to us. That development would harm our reputation, our prospects for future work and our operating results. Furthermore, the issuance of a notice from the FDA or the USDA based on a finding of a material violation by us of good clinical practice, good laboratory practice or good manufacturing practice requirements or other applicable regulations could materially and adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nPrivacy regulations could increase our costs or limit our services.\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 demand compliance with patient privacy and confidentiality requirements. In addition, some state governments are considering more stringent regulations. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in May 2018, imposes heightened obligations on businesses that control and manage the personal data of E.U. citizens. These and similar regulations might require us to increase our investment in security or limit the services we offer. We could be found liable if we fail to meet existing or proposed regulations on privacy and security of health information.\nRisks Related to Research and Development\nOur future success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes that could make our services and products less competitive or obsolete.\nThe biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries generally, and contract research services more specifically, are subject to increasingly rapid technological changes. Our competitors or others might develop technologies, services or products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies, services or products, or that render our technologies, services or products less competitive or obsolete. If competitors introduce superior technologies, services or products and we cannot make enhancements to our counterparts to remain competitive, our competitive position, and in turn our business, revenues and financial condition, would be materially and adversely affected. Many of our competitors have superior financial and human resources deployed toward research and development efforts. Our relatively constrained financial and human resources may limit our ability to effectively keep pace with relevant technological changes.\nWe may incur expenses on potential products that we never successfully develop or commercialize.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur research and development and other expenses in connection with our Products business. We might never successfully develop or commercialize potential products to which we devote resources for numerous reasons, including:\n\u25cf inability to develop products that address our clients\u2019 needs;\n\u25cf competitive products with superior performance;\n\u25cf patent conflicts or unenforceable intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf demand for the particular product; and\n\u25cf other factors that could make the product uneconomical.\nIncurring expenses for a potential product that is not successfully developed and/or commercialized could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and stock price.\nRisks Related to Technology and Cybersecurity\nWe may be at risk of cyber-attacks or other security breaches that could compromise sensitive business information, undermine our ability to operate effectively and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nCyber-attacks or security breaches could compromise confidential client information, cause a disruption in our operations, harm our reputation and expose us to liability, which in turn could negatively impact our business and the value of our common shares. As a routine element of our business, we collect, analyze, and retain substantial amounts of data pertaining to the clinical and non-clinical studies we conduct for our clients. We also maintain other sensitive client information, information regarding intellectual property related to our Products segment and other business-critical information, including personally identifiable information of our employees. Our employees, some of whom have access to such information, have and will likely continue to receive \u201cphishing\u201d e-mails intended to trick recipients into surrendering their usernames and passwords. We cannot completely protect against the possibility that sensitive information may be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen, via phishing attempts or other circumstances.\nOur success depends in part on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems. A cyber breach of our computer and communications systems could also impede several aspects of our business, as described below under the section \u201cHardware or software failures, delays in the operations of our computer and communications systems or the failure to implement system enhancements could harm our business.\nWe utilize cybersecurity technologies, processes and practices which are designed to protect our networks, computers, programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access, but they may not be effective or work as designed. Our contracts with our clients typically contain provisions that require us to keep confidential the information generated from our studies. A cyber-attack could result in a breach of those provisions or other negative outcomes, including legal claims or proceedings, investigations, potential liabilities under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, delays and other impediments to our clients\u2019 discovery and development efforts, ransomware demands and related delays, damage to our reputation and a negative impact on our financial results and the value of our common shares.\nHardware or software failures, delays in the operations of our computer and communications systems or the failure to implement system enhancements could harm our business.\nWe operate large and complex computer systems that contain significant amounts of client data. Our success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems. A failure of our network or data gathering procedures could impede the processing of data, delivery of databases and services, client orders and day-to-day management of our business and could result in the corruption or loss of data. While we have disaster recovery plans in place for our operations, they might not adequately protect us. Despite any precautions we take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins and similar events at our facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to our servers and from our servers to our clients. In addition, any failure by our computer environment to provide our required data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our service. In the event of a delay in the delivery of data, we could be required to transfer our data collection operations to an alternative provider of server hosting services. Such a transfer could result in delays in our ability to deliver our products and services to our clients. Additionally, significant delays in the planned delivery of system enhancements, improvements and inadequate performance of the systems once they are completed could harm our business. Finally, long-term disruptions in our computer and communications infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, the escalation of hostilities and acts of terrorism, particularly involving cities in which we have offices, could adversely affect our businesses. Although we carry property and business interruption insurance, our coverage might not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur.\nRisks Related to Share Ownership\nOur share price could continue to be volatile and our trading volume may fluctuate substantially.\nThe market price of our common shares has historically been and might continue to be volatile. Many factors may have a significant impact on the future price of our common shares, including:\n\u25cf our failure to successfully implement our business objectives;\n\u25cf compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf market acceptance of our products;\n\u25cf technological innovations, new commercial products or drug discovery efforts and preclinical and clinical activities by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in government regulations;\n\u25cf pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as the recent international outbreak of COVID-19;\n\u25cf general economic conditions and other external factors;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results;\n\u25cf ability to fund future growth;\n\u25cf the degree of trading liquidity in our common shares; and\n\u25cf our ability to meet the minimum standards required for remaining listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nFactors which may impact the price of our common shares include influences beyond our control, such as market conditions and changes in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries we serve. The stock market, and in particular the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnology company stocks, has experienced periods of significant price and volume fluctuations, including most recently as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Volatility and valuation decline have affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies, often for reasons unrelated to their operating performance, and might adversely affect the price of our common shares.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and under Indiana law may discourage or prevent a change in control, even if a sale of us would benefit our shareholders, which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by shareholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control, discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common shares, harm the market price of our common shares, and diminish the voting and other rights of the holders of our common shares. These provisions include:\n\u25cf dividing our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms;\n\u25cf authorizing our board of directors to issue preferred stock and additional common shares without shareholder approval;\n\u25cf requiring one or more written demands signed and dated by holders of at least 25% of all the votes entitled to be cast on any issue proposed to be considered at a special meeting for shareholders to call a special meeting;\n\u25cf prohibiting our shareholders from amending our Second Amended and Restated Bylaws; and\n\u25cf requiring advance notice for nominating directors at shareholders\u2019 meetings.\nOur board of directors also has the ability to adopt a shareholder rights agreement, sometimes called a \u201cpoison pill,\u201d providing for the issuance of a new series of preferred stock to holders of common shares. In the event of a takeover attempt, this preferred stock would give rights to holders of common shares (other than the potential acquirer) to buy\nadditional common shares at a discount, leading to the dilution of the potential acquirer\u2019s stake. The board\u2019s ability to adopt a poison pill may discourage potential takeover offers, particularly by suitors the board may view as unfavorable transaction partners.\nAs an Indiana corporation, we are governed by the Indiana Business Corporation Law (as amended from time to time, the \u201cIBCL\u201d). Under specified circumstances, certain provisions of the IBCL related to control share acquisitions, business combinations, and constituent interests may delay, prevent, or make more difficult unsolicited acquisitions or changes of control. These provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish Company transactions that shareholders might deem to be in their best interest.\nIf we are unable to maintain listing of our securities on the NASDAQ Capital Market or another reputable stock exchange, it may be more difficult for our shareholders to sell their securities.\nNASDAQ requires listed issuers to comply with certain standards in order to remain listed on its exchange. If, for any reason, NASDAQ should delist our securities from trading on its exchange and we are unable to obtain listing on another reputable national securities exchange, a reduction in some or all of the following may occur, each of which could materially adversely affect our shareholders:\n\u25cf the liquidity of our common shares;\n\u25cf the market price of our common shares;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations;\n\u25cf the number of institutional and general investors that will consider investing in our common shares;\n\u25cf the number of market makers in our common shares;\n\u25cf the availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our common shares; and\n\u25cf the number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common shares.\nWe have never paid cash dividends and currently do not intend to do so.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common shares. We currently plan to retain any earnings to finance the growth of our business rather than to pay cash dividends. Payments of any cash dividends in the future will depend on our financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.\nRisks Related to our Merger and Acquisition Activities\nWe have and may further expand our business through acquisitions, which exposes us to various risks. Our recent acquisitions pose certain incremental risks to the Company.\nWe review acquisition candidates as part of our continuing business strategy. Most recently, the Company acquired the businesses as described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, and subsequent to fiscal 2021 year-end, the Company completed the acquisition of Plato BioPharma, Inc. (\u201cPlato\u201d) and the Envigo RMS Holding Corporation (\u201cEnvigo\u201d) acquisition by merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company with and into Envigo, which will constitute a significant portion of our operations. Factors which may affect our ability to effectively pursue acquisition targets or to grow successfully through completed acquisitions, including our recent acquisitions, include:\n\u25cf The inability of the Company to obtain financing for the acquisition of targets;\n\u25cf Difficulties and expenses in connection with integrating acquired companies and achieving expected benefits, including as related to the integration of departments, accounting and other systems, technologies, books and records and procedures;\n\u25cf Diversion of management\u2019s attention from daily operations to various integration activities;\n\u25cf The potential for disruption of prior operations and plans;\n\u25cf The risk that acquisitions could be dilutive to earnings, or in the event of acquisitions made through the issuance of our common shares to the shareholders of the acquired company, dilutive to the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders;\n\u25cf The possibility that we may be adversely affected by risks facing the acquired companies, including potential losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of acquired companies not covered by the indemnification we may obtain from the sellers;\n\u25cf Risks associated with the assimilation and retention of employees, including key employees;\n\u25cf The potential loss of, or adverse effects on, existing business relationships the acquired business has with suppliers and clients;\n\u25cf The potential need to address relevant internal control over financial reporting and disclosure control and procedures matters;\n\u25cf Possible deficiencies in operational processes and procedures;\n\u25cf Risks associated with carrying a relatively significant level of debt in a cyclical business; and\n\u25cf The ability of our management team to manage expanded operations to meet operational and financial expectations.\nWe have incurred significant additional indebtedness during recent periods, which may impair our ability to raise further capital or impact our ability to service our debt.\nWe have incurred significant additional indebtedness during recent periods, including in order to fund the cash portion of the purchase prices of our recent acquisitions, to fund the purchase price of our St. Louis facility, to make capital expenditures and to support other corporate endeavors. Our additional indebtedness may impair our ability to raise further capital, including to expand our business, pursue strategic investments, and take advantage of financing or other opportunities that we believe to be in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders. Our additional indebtedness may also impact our ability to service our debt and to comply with financial covenants and the other terms of our relevant credit arrangements, in which case our lenders might pursue available remedies up to and including terminating our credit arrangements and foreclosing on available collateral.\nWe may need additional capital, and any additional capital we seek may not be available in the amount or at the time we need it.\nSuccessful execution of our growth plans will require that we have access to capital. Our expected financing needs are based upon management\u2019s estimates as to future revenue and expense. Our business plan and financing needs are subject to change based upon, among other factors, our ability to increase revenues and manage expenses and the timing and extent of our future capital expenditures and acquisition activity. If our estimates of our financing needs change, we may need additional capital more quickly than we expect or we may need a greater amount of capital.\nIn general, additional capital may be raised through the sale of common shares, preferred equity or convertible debt securities, entry into debt facilities or other third-party funding arrangements. The sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our shareholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of our common shares. Agreements entered into in connection with such capital raising activities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations or require us to relinquish certain rights. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot timely raise any needed funds, we may be forced to reduce our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our ability to implement our long-term strategic roadmap and grow our business.\nThe Company may fail to realize anticipated strategic and financial benefits from recent acquisitions.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our recent business acquisitions. These acquisitions may not further our business strategy as we expect, we may fail to successfully integrate the acquired operations as planned or to realize the synergies and other benefits we expected from the acquisitions, we may experience unexpected adverse impacts on the acquired businesses, or we may otherwise not realize the expected return on our investments, any of which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we record as a part of the acquisitions, including intangible assets and goodwill. We may have difficulties managing the acquired businesses or retaining key personnel of the acquired companies.\nOur operating results or financial condition also may be adversely impacted by (i) claims or liabilities related to the acquired companies\u2019 businesses including, among others, claims from U.S. regulatory or other governmental agencies, terminated employees, current or former customers or business partners, or other third parties; (ii) pre-existing contractual relationships of the acquired companies that we would not have otherwise entered into, the termination or modification of which may be costly or disruptive to our business; (iii) unfavorable accounting treatment as a result of the acquired companies' practices; and (iv) intellectual property claims or disputes.\nCertain of the companies we have acquired are not required to maintain an internal control infrastructure that would meet the standards of a public company, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and we may acquire similar companies in the future. The costs that we may incur to implement such controls and procedures may be substantial and we could encounter unexpected delays and challenges in this implementation. In addition, we may discover significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the quality of an acquired company's financial and disclosure controls and procedures which could result in additional costs or adversely affect our business or operating results.\nOur due diligence of our recently acquired businesses may not have identified all pertinent risks, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nAs part of our merger and acquisition due diligence, we utilize information provided by relevant sellers. As is true with any merger and acquisition transaction, we may not be aware of all liabilities of the acquired business at the time of acquisition. Potential incremental liabilities and additional risks and uncertainties related to our recently acquired businesses not known or fully appreciated by us could negatively impact our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Factors Relating to our Business Following the Acquisition of Envigo\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate Envigo\u2019s business into our business or achieve the anticipated benefits of the Envigo Acquisition.\nThe success of the Envigo Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our business with Envigo\u2019s business, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate or otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of the Envigo Acquisition. Difficulties in integrating the two businesses may result in us performing differently than expected, in operational challenges, or in the failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include, among others:\n\u25cf the inability to successfully integrate Envigo in a manner that permits the achievement of full revenue, expected cash flows and cost savings anticipated from the Envigo Acquisition;\n\u25cf not realizing anticipated operating synergies;\n\u25cf integrating personnel from Envigo and the loss of key employees;\n\u25cf potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses associated with the Envigo Acquisition;\n\u25cf integrating relationships with customers, vendors and business partners;\n\u25cf performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by completing the Envigo Acquisition and integrating Envigo\u2019s operations; and\n\u25cf the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, Inotiv\u2019s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.\nWe may not be able to accomplish this integration process successfully.\nOur results may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the Envigo Acquisition.\nAs a result of the Envigo Acquisition, the size and scope of our business increased significantly beyond its previous size. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage this expanded business, which poses numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate the operations and business of Envigo into our existing business in an efficient and timely manner, to combine systems and management controls and to integrate relationships with customers, vendors and business partners.\nActions of animal rights activists may affect our business.\nEnvigo's RMS business provides animal research models to our customers. Such activities are required for the registration of products under regulatory regimes in the United States, Europe and other countries. Many CROs, biopharmaceutical companies and other research organizations have been targeted by animal rights activists who oppose all testing on animals, for whatever purpose, including the animal testing activities in support of safety and efficacy testing for drug development. These groups, which include groups directed at the industry and us, have publicly stated that the goal of their campaign is to stop animal testing. Acts of vandalism and other acts by animal rights activists who object to the use of animals in product development could have a material adverse effect on our business. These groups have historically targeted CROs, academic institutions and biopharmaceutical companies, but also third parties that do business with CROs, academic institutions and biopharmaceutical companies, including customers, suppliers, advisors, financial advisors, lenders and investors.\nWe are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities which could lead to enforcement actions if those authorities determine that our facilities or procedures do not meet applicable requirements.\nWe are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities, including the FDA and the USDA. As part of these inspections, the regulatory authorities seek to determine whether our facilities and operations comply with applicable laws and regulations. Adverse findings as a result of these inspections could lead to enforcement actions, including substantial fines, warning letters that require corrective action (including potential facilities improvement requirements), revocation of approvals, exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs, criminal prosecution and even the denial of the right to conduct business. During the period from July through December 2021, one of the Envigo\u2019s U.S. facilities was inspected on several occasions by the USDA. Following the inspection, USDA issued inspection reports with findings of non-compliance with certain USDA laws and regulations. Envigo formally appealed certain of the findings and the USDA has indicated it intends to conduct a formal investigation. The inspections and/or the investigation could lead to enforcement action resulting in penalties that could include a temporary restraining order or injunction, civil and/or criminal penalties, and/or license suspension or revocation. The imposition of any of these penalties or other restrictions on our business as a result of the inspections could adversely affect our business reputation and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nOur principal shareholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over matters subject to shareholder approval.\nAs of December 1, 2021, our executive officers, directors and 5% shareholders beneficially owned approximately 37.0% of the outstanding shares of capital stock. In addition, as of December 1, 2021, our executive officers and directors held options to purchase an aggregate of 747,075 of our common shares at a weighted-average exercise price of $7.83 per share. Therefore, these shareholders will have the ability to influence us through this ownership position. The interests of this group of shareholders may not coincide with the interests of other shareholders.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public markets, or the perception that such sales could occur, could reduce the market price of our common shares.\nSales of a substantial number of our common shares in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common shares. As of December 1, 2021, we had 24,266,099 common shares outstanding. Of the 24,266,099 common shares outstanding as of December 1, 2021, approximately 13,202,411 shares are available for sale in the public market.\nIn addition, as of December 1, 2021 there were 1,672,770 common shares subject to outstanding options. We have registered all of the common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options, upon the vesting of outstanding restricted stock and upon exercise or settlement of any other equity incentives we may grant in the future under our incentive plan under the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares may be freely sold in the public market upon issuance as permitted by any applicable vesting requirements, in some cases, subject to volume, manner of sale and other limitations of Rule 144 and the terms of our insider trading policy.\nThe resale of certain shares issued in the Envigo Acquisition to be covered by a resale registration statement could adversely affect the market price of our common shares, which result could in turn negatively affect our ability to raise additional equity capital.\nThe Shareholders Agreement which we entered with certain former shareholders of Envigo in connection with the Envigo Acquisition requires us to prepare and file and use our commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective no later than May 4, 2022 a registration statement registering the resale of 6,890,710 of our common shares held by the shareholders who are parties to the Shareholders Agreement. The resale registration statement will permit the resale of these shares at any time and without restriction, subject to applicable lock-up provisions in the Shareholders Agreement. The sale, or availability for sale, of our common shares in the public market may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and may impair our ability to raise additional equity capital. The resale of a substantial number of our common shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price for our common shares and make it more difficult for you to sell our common shares at times and prices that you feel are appropriate. Furthermore, because there are a large number of shares registered pursuant to the resale registration statement, the selling shareholders named in such registration statement may continue to offer shares covered by the resale registration statement for a significant period of time, the precise duration of which cannot be predicted. Accordingly, the adverse market and price pressures resulting from an offering pursuant to the resale registration statement may continue for an extended period of time and continued negative pressure on the market price of our common shares could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional equity capital.\nThe trading price and volume of our Common Shares may be volatile following the Envigo Acquisition.\nThe trading price and volume of our Common Shares may be volatile following completion of the Envigo Acquisition. The stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Common Shares. As a result, you may suffer a loss on your investment.\nThe market for the Common Shares will depend on a number of conditions, most of which we cannot control, including:\n\u25cf general economic conditions within the U.S. and internationally, including changes in interest rates;\n\u25cf general market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices;\n\u25cf domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to Inotiv\u2019s performance;\n\u25cf volatility in the financial markets or other global economic factors, including the impact of COVID-19;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results and those of our competitors;\n\u25cf quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as revenue, EBITDA, net income and net income per share;\n\u25cf our businesses, operations, results and prospects;\n\u25cf our operating and financial performance;\n\u25cf future mergers and strategic alliances;\n\u25cf market conditions in CRO or research model industries;\n\u25cf changes in government regulation, taxes, legal proceedings or other developments;\n\u25cf shortfalls in the combined company\u2019s operating results from levels forecasted by securities analysts;\n\u25cf investor sentiment toward the stock of animal breeding companies;\n\u25cf changes in revenue or earnings estimates, or changes in recommendations by equity research analysts;\n\u25cf failure to achieve the perceived benefits of the Envigo Acquisition, including financial results and anticipated synergies, as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts;\n\u25cf speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u25cf the failure of research analysts to cover our Common Shares;\n\u25cf sales of our Common Shares by us, large shareholders or management, or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u25cf changes in accounting principles, policies, guidance, interpretations or standards;\n\u25cf announcements concerning us or our competitors;\n\u25cf public reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf strategic actions taken by competitors;\n\u25cf actions taken by our shareholders;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u25cf maintenance of acceptable credit ratings or credit quality; and\n\u25cf the general state of the securities markets.\nThese and other factors may impair the market for the Common Shares and the ability of investors to sell shares at an attractive price. These factors also could cause the market price and demand for the Common Shares to fluctuate substantially, which may negatively affect the price and liquidity of the Common Shares. Many of these factors and conditions are beyond our control.\nSecurities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss of the services of such personnel could adversely affect our business. Also, because of the nature of our business, our success depends upon our ability to attract, train, manage and retain technologically qualified personnel.\nThere is substantial competition for qualified personnel, and an inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel may impact our ability to grow our business and compete effectively in our industry.\nWe rely on third parties for important services.\nWe have historically depended on third parties to provide us with services critical to our business, including without limitation transportation services. The failure of third parties to adequately provide needed services or our determination to forgo non-critical services, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions may materially adversely affect our business.\nWhile it is difficult for us to predict the impact of general economic conditions on our business, these conditions could reduce client demand for some of our products or services, which could cause our revenue to decline. Also, our clients, particularly smaller biotechnology companies which are especially reliant on the credit and capital markets, may not be able to obtain adequate access to credit or equity funding, which could affect their ability to timely pay us. Moreover, we rely on credit facilities to provide working capital to support our operations and regularly evaluate alternative financing sources. Changes in the commercial credit market or in the financial stability of our creditors may impact the ability of our creditors to provide additional financing. In addition, the financial condition of our credit facility providers, which is beyond our control, may adversely change. Any decrease in our access to borrowings under our credit facility or successor facilities (if any), tightening of lending standards and other changes to our sources of liquidity could adversely impact our ability to obtain the financing we need to continue operating our business in the current manner. For these reasons, among others, if economic conditions stagnate or decline, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 85526, "SIC": 8731, "TIC": "BASI"}
