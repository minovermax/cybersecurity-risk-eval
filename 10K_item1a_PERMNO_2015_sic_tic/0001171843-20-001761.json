{"cik": "1626878", "company": "XBiotech Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and may incur significant losses in the future.\nWe are a pre-market pharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. We had no net income prior to the fourth quarter of 2019, when we sold certain assets to Janssen Biotech, Inc. and entered into certain related commercial agreements (the \u201cJanssen Transaction\u201d). Investment in pharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate efficacy or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. We do not have any products approved by regulatory authorities for marketing or commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales, or otherwise, to date, and we continue to incur significant research, development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we incurred losses in every reporting period from our inception in 2005 through the third quarter of 2019. Although we were profitable during the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 due to the cash received in the Janssen Transaction, that was an extraordinary transaction outside of normal business operations that had never previously occurred and may not be repeated.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and may incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate these expenses will increase as we continue the research and development of, and seek regulatory approvals for our current and future product candidates in various indications, and potentially begin to commercialize any products that may achieve regulatory approval. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our financial condition. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenues. Our prior losses have had, and any future losses may continue to have, an adverse effect on our financial condition. If any of our product candidates fail in clinical trials or do not gain regulatory approval, or if approved fail to achieve market acceptance, we may never sustain profitability. We will need to raise significant additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations.\nSince inception, we have dedicated a majority of our resources to the discovery and development of our proprietary preclinical and clinical product candidates, and we expect to continue to expend substantial resources doing so for the foreseeable future. These expenditures will include costs associated with conducting research and development, manufacturing product candidates and products approved for sale, conducting preclinical experiments and clinical trials and obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals, as well as commercializing any products later approved for sale. During the year ending December 31, 2019, we recognized approximately $24.1 million in expenses associated with research and development and clinical trials.\nWe completed our initial public offering on April 15, 2015 and additional registered offerings in March 2017 and May 2019. We also received a significant amount of cash proceeds from the Janssen Transaction. However, the net proceeds from these transactions and cash on hand may not be sufficient to complete clinical development of any of our product candidates nor may it be sufficient to commercialize any product candidate. In addition, we completed a modified Dutch auction tender offer for our common shares in February 2020, which consumed $420 million of our cash resources. Accordingly, we may require substantial additional capital beyond the offering to continue our clinical development and potential commercialization activities. Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022 the number and characteristics of the future product candidates we pursue;\n\u2022 the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing any of our future product candidates, and conducting preclinical research and clinical trials;\n\u2022 the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for any future product candidates we develop;\n\u2022 the cost of future commercialization activities for our product candidates and the cost of commercializing any future products approved for sale;\n\u2022 the cost of manufacturing our future products; and\n\u2022 the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patents, including litigation costs and the outcome of any such litigation.\nWe are unable to accurately estimate the funds we will actually require to complete research and development of our product candidates or the funds required to commercialize any resulting product in the future or the funds that will be required to meet other expenses. Our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and our expenses may be higher than expected. We may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. Raising funds in the future may present additional challenges and future financing may not be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing shareholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nThe terms of any financing arrangements we enter into may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our shareholders and the issuance of additional securities, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities would dilute all of our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and, potentially, the imposition of restrictive covenants. Those covenants may include limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable resulting in the loss of rights to some of our product candidates or other unfavorable terms, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. Additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our products.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe currently have no source of product revenue and may never sustain profitability.\nTo date, we have not generated any revenues from commercial product sales. Our ability to generate revenue in the future from product sales and achieve profitability will depend upon our ability, alone or with any future collaborators, to commercialize products successfully, including any current product candidates or any product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire in the future. Even if we are able to achieve regulatory approval for any current or future product candidates, we do not know when any of these products will generate revenue from product sales, if at all. Our ability to generate revenue from product sales from any of our product candidates also depends on a number of additional factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022 complete development activities, including the necessary clinical trials;\n\u2022 complete and submit new drug applications, or NDAs, to the US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and obtain regulatory approval for indications for which there is a commercial market;\n\u2022 complete and submit applications to, and obtain regulatory approval from, foreign regulatory authorities such as the European Medicines Agency, or EMA;\n\u2022 establish our manufacturing operations;\n\u2022 develop a commercial organization capable of sales, marketing and distribution for our product candidates and any products for which we obtain marketing approval and intend to sell ourselves in the markets in which we choose to commercialize on our own;\n\u2022 find suitable distribution partners to help us market, sell and distribute our approved products in other markets;\n\u2022 obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, including government and private payers;\n\u2022 achieve market acceptance for our products, if any;\n\u2022 establish, maintain and protect our intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022 attract, hire and retain qualified personnel.\nIn addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, including that our product candidates may not advance through development or achieve the endpoints of applicable clinical trials, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or if we will be able to sustain profitability. In addition, our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we decide to or are required by the FDA, or foreign regulatory authorities, to perform studies or trials in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Even if we are able to complete the development and regulatory process for our product candidates, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing these products.\nEven if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of any of our product candidates that may be approved, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. If we are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nOur future success is dependent on the regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe do not have any products that have gained regulatory approval. As a result, our ability to finance our operations and generate revenue, are substantially dependent on our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and, if approved, to successfully commercialize our product candidates in a timely manner. We cannot commercialize our other product candidates in the U.S. without first obtaining regulatory approval for each product from the FDA; similarly, we cannot commercialize any product candidates outside of the U.S. without obtaining regulatory approval from comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. The FDA review process typically takes years to complete and approval is never guaranteed. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any of our potential product candidates for a target indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical and well-controlled clinical studies, including two well-controlled Phase III studies, and, with respect to approval in the U.S. to the satisfaction of the FDA, and in Europe, to the satisfaction of the EMA, that the product candidate is safe and effective for use for that target indication; and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate. Obtaining regulatory approval for marketing of our current or future product candidates in one country does not ensure we will be able to obtain regulatory approval in other countries. A failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in other countries.\nEven if any of our product candidates were to successfully obtain approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, any approval might contain significant limitations related to use restrictions for specified age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, or may be subject to burdensome post-approval studies or risk management requirements. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in one or more jurisdictions, or any approval contains significant limitations, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue to continue the development of any of our other product candidates that we are developing or may discover, in-license, develop or acquire in the future. Also, any regulatory approval of our product candidates, once obtained, may be withdrawn. Furthermore, even if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, their commercial success will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022 development of a commercial organization within XBiotech or establishment of a commercial collaboration with a commercial infrastructure;\n\u2022 establishment of commercially viable pricing and obtaining approval for adequate reimbursement from third-party and government payers;\n\u2022 our ability to manufacture quantities of our product candidates using commercially satisfactory processes and at a scale sufficient to meet anticipated demand and enable us to reduce our cost of manufacturing;\n\u2022 our success in educating physicians and patients about the benefits, administration and use of our product candidates;\n\u2022 the availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of alternative and competing treatments;\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our own or our potential strategic collaborators\u2019 marketing, sales and distribution strategy and operations;\n\u2022 acceptance as a safe and effective therapy by patients and the medical community; and\n\u2022 a continued acceptable safety profile following approval.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. If we are unable to successfully commercialize our product candidates, we may not be able to earn sufficient revenues to continue our business.\nNew laws or regulations may be promulgated or modified in the United States, in Europe, or other jurisdictions that could impact our ability to receive the necessary approvals to successfully market and commercialize our product candidates.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is one of the most regulated on a state, federal and international level. There are a number of laws, regulations, and court decisions which impact the daily activities of our business. As a result, we must ensure that strategies and planning in relation to our product candidates are in line with the current regulations governing our industry. When there are changes in leadership, whether within the U.S., or elsewhere, we must anticipate the possibility of shifts in regulatory policies as they pertain to our business. New or modified regulations may impact our ability to quickly respond with updates to our programs. While we may be able to anticipate certain changes, policy statements often are not always translated into actionable legislation. We continue to track updates and changes internally to ensure we are in compliance with regulatory authority guidelines and expectations. Court decisions at both the state and federal level can also impact the way in which we operate and make specific product related program decisions. New laws, regulations, or court orders could materially alter or impact our ability to receive necessary approvals from regulatory authorities to market and commercialize our product candidates.\nBecause the results of earlier clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, product candidates we advance into clinical trials, may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval.\nSuccess in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of an investigational drug. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials. We do not know whether the clinical trials we are conducting, or may conduct, will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates in any particular jurisdiction. Even if we believe that we have adequate data to support an application for regulatory approval to market our product candidates, the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not agree and could require us to conduct additional research studies, including late-stage clinical trials. If late-stage clinical trials do not produce favorable results, our ability to achieve regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be adversely impacted.\nIf we are unable to enroll subjects in clinical trials, we will be unable to complete these trials on a timely basis.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of subjects to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, ability to obtain and maintain patient consents, risk that enrolled subjects will drop out before completion, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. Furthermore, we rely on Clinical Research Organizations (CRO\u2019s) and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials, and while we have agreements governing their committed activities, we have limited influence over their actual, day-to-day performance. We may experience delays in starting-up clinical trial sites in a timely manner, enrolling subjects in our trials, and may not be able to enroll a sufficient number of subjects to complete the trials. In addition, in December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the United States and various countries in Europe, resulting in the declaration by the World Health Organization of a global pandemic. To date, concerns related to the spread of coronavirus have already resulted in travel restrictions, shutdowns of certain businesses, bans on large public gatherings and declarations of states of emergency in cities, states and countries around the world. Concentrations of infected patients or reactions to the coronavirus outbreak or future similar regional or global health concerns could negatively affect our ability to recruit and retain subjects in clinical trials if they disproportionately impact the sites in which we conduct any of our trials, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operation and financial condition.\nIf we experience delays in the completion or if there is termination of, any clinical trial of any current or future product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales, which would impair our ability to generate revenues and may harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and future prospects. In addition, many of the factors that could cause a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business may fail.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities is unpredictable, but typically takes several years following the commencement of preclinical studies and clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities and any shifts in regulatory policy. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate, and it is possible that none of the product candidates we are developing or may discover, in-license or acquire and seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nOur product candidates could fail to receive marketing approval from the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority for many reasons, including but not limited to:\n\u2022 disagreement over the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022 failure to demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and effective;\n\u2022 failure of clinical trials to meet the level of statistical significance required for approval;\n\u2022 failure to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022 disagreement over our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022 disagreement over whether to accept efficacy results from clinical trial sites outside the United States where the standard of care is potentially different from that in the United States;\n\u2022 the insufficiency of data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates to support the submission and filing of an NDA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval;\n\u2022 irreparable or critical compliance issues relating to our manufacturing and/clinical trial processes; or\n\u2022 changes in the approval policies or regulations that render our preclinical and clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThe FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require more information, including additional preclinical or clinical data to support approval, which may delay or prevent approval and our commercialization plans, or we may decide to abandon the development program altogether. Even if we do obtain regulatory approval, our product candidates may be approved for fewer or more limited indications than we request, approved contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or approved with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. In addition, if any of our product candidates produce undesirable side effects or safety issues, the FDA may require the establishment of Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require the establishment of a similar strategy, that may, restrict distribution of our products and impose burdensome implementation requirements. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nEven if we believe any completed, current or planned clinical trials are successful, the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may not agree that our completed clinical trials provide adequate data on the safety or efficacy of our product candidates, permitting us to proceed to additional clinical trials. Approval by comparable foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by the FDA and approval by one or more foreign regulatory authorities does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the FDA. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative impact on the regulatory process in others. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals, and even if we file we may not receive the necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following any marketing approval.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authority. If toxicities occur in our current or future clinical trials they could cause delay or even the discontinuation of further development of our product candidates, which would impair our ability to generate revenues and would have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and future prospects. There can be no assurance that side effects from our product candidates in future clinical trials or that side effects in general will not prompt the discontinued development or possible market approval of our product candidates. If serious side effects or other safety or toxicity issues are experienced in our clinical trials in the future, we may not receive approval to market any of our product candidates, which could prevent us from ever generating revenues from commercial product sales or sustaining profitability. Results of our trials could reveal an unacceptably high severity and prevalence of side effects. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled subjects to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and future prospects.\nAdditionally, if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such product, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022 we may be forced to suspend marketing of such product;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals of such product;\n\u2022 regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label that could diminish the usage or otherwise limit the commercial success of such product;\n\u2022 the FDA or other regulatory bodies may issue safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings about such product;\n\u2022 the FDA may require the establishment or modification of REMS or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require the establishment or modification of a similar strategy that may, for instance, restrict distribution of our product and impose burdensome implementation requirements on us;\n\u2022 we may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u2022 we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to subjects or patients;\n\u2022 we may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u2022 our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, it would be subject to ongoing requirements by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities governing the manufacture, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The safety profile of any product will continue to be closely monitored by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities after approval. If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities become aware of new safety information after approval of any product candidate, they may require labeling changes or establishment of a REMS or similar strategy, impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance. For example, the label ultimately approved for any product candidate, if it achieves marketing approval, may include restrictions on use.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and other regulations. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, our manufacturing facility, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our product candidates or our manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022 issue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022 impose restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product candidates;\n\u2022 mandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u2022 require us or any future collaborator to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022 seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022 suspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022 suspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022 refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n\u2022 suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022 seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenue.\nThe FDA strictly regulates the advertising and promotion of drug products, and drug products may only be marketed or promoted for their FDA approved uses, consistent with the product\u2019s approved labeling. Advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval in the U.S., and is covered by federal insurance programs such as Medicare or Medicaid, will be heavily scrutinized by the FDA, the Department of Justice, (DOJ), the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, (HHS), state attorneys general, members of Congress and the public. Violations, including promotion of our products for unapproved or off-label uses, are subject to enforcement letters, inquiries and investigations, and civil, criminal and/or administrative sanctions by the FDA and/or the DOJ. Additionally, advertising and promotion of, any product candidate that obtains approval outside of the U.S. will be heavily scrutinized by comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nIn the U.S., engaging in impermissible promotion of our future products for off-label uses can also subject us to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes, which can lead to civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties and fines and corporate integrity agreements that materially restrict the manner in which we promote or distribute our drug products. The federal False Claims Act, allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company on behalf of the federal government alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims, or causing to present such false or fraudulent claims, for payment by a federal program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. If the government prevails in the lawsuit, the individual may share in any fines or settlement funds. Since 2004, False Claims Act lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies have increased significantly in volume and breadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements based on certain sales practices promoting off-label drug uses. This growth in litigation has increased the risk that a pharmaceutical company will have to defend a false claims action, pay settlement fines or restitution, agree to comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations, and be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. If we do not lawfully promote our approved products, we may become subject to such litigation and, if we are not successful in defending against such actions, those actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and future prospects.\nExisting government regulations may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and/or be subject to fines or enhanced government oversight and reporting obligations, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to sustain profitability.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed in those jurisdictions.\nIn order to market and sell our products in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the U.S. generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. Additionally, in many countries outside the U.S., it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be effectively commercialized in that country. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the U.S. on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the U.S. does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. A failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. If we are unable to obtain approval of any of our product candidates by regulatory authorities in the European Union or another jurisdiction, the commercial prospects of that product candidate may be significantly diminished and our business prospects could decline.\nEven if we are able to commercialize our product candidates, the products may not receive coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, which could harm our business.\nOur ability to commercialize any products successfully will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government authorities, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations and third-party payers. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Coverage and adequate reimbursement from government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurers are critical to new product acceptance. Patients are unlikely to use our product candidates unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our product candidates. A primary trend in the US healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. As a result, government authorities and other third-party payers have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payers are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Third-party payers may also seek additional clinical evidence, beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval, demonstrating clinical benefits and value in specific patient populations before covering our products for those patients. We cannot be sure that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or are available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, obtaining coverage does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sales and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also be insufficient to cover our costs, and may only be temporary. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used. Reimbursement rates may also be based in part on existing reimbursement amounts for lower cost drugs or may be bundled into the payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payers and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the U.S. Coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payer to payer. As a result, the coverage and reimbursement determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained or applied consistently. Third-party payers often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payers for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products, and our overall financial condition.\nWe have never marketed a drug before, and if we are unable to establish an effective sales force and marketing infrastructure, or enter into acceptable third-party sales and marketing or licensing arrangements, we may be unable to generate any revenue.\nWe do not currently have a comprehensive infrastructure for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical drug products. The cost of establishing and maintaining such an infrastructure may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. In order to market any products that may be approved by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services for which we would incur substantial costs. If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not sustain profitability. We will be competing with many companies that have extensive and well-funded sales and marketing operations. Without an internal commercial organization or the support of a third party to perform sales and marketing functions, or a combination of both, we may be unable to compete successfully against more established companies.\nOur product candidates, if approved, may not achieve adequate market acceptance among physicians, patients, and healthcare payers and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, such product(s) may not gain market acceptance among physicians, healthcare payers, patients or the medical community within the U.S. or globally. Our commercial success also depends on coverage and adequate reimbursement of our product candidates by third-party payers, including government payers, generally, which may be difficult or time-consuming to obtain, may be limited in scope and may not be obtained in all jurisdictions in which we may seek to market our products. Market acceptance of any of our product candidates for which we receive approval depends on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 the efficacy and safety of such product candidates as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u2022 the clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved;\n\u2022 acceptance by physicians and patients of the product candidate as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022 the potential and perceived advantages of product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u2022 the safety of product candidates seen in a broader patient group, including a product candidate\u2019s use outside the approved indications;\n\u2022 the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022 product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022 the timing of market introduction of our products as well as competitive products;\n\u2022 the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022 the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by third-party payers and government authorities;\n\u2022 relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u2022 the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and those of our collaborators; and\n\u2022 unfavorable publicity relating to the product candidate or the Company.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved but fail to achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, or healthcare payers, we will not be able to generate significant revenues, which would compromise our ability to sustain profitability.\nOur research programs may not succeed.\nIn the last couple of years, XBiotech has positioned itself with a pipeline of potential drug candidates at all stages of development, from pre-clinical through Phase III clinical trial stage. Even though we have many drugs in development at this time, none of these research programs may succeed. There are several reasons why a drug program may fail, including the following:\n\u2022 In the development stage, we may be unable to develop a therapy, which would mean us succeeding in isolating appropriate antibodies to reach the clinical trial stage;\n\u2022 Any partnerships for the development of antibodies could fail to produce results that would necessitate clinical trials;\n\u2022 We may not receive approval from regulatory bodies to move from early stage clinical trials to later stage clinical trials;\n\u2022 Even if we are able to move to later stage clinical trials, it may prove to be difficult to enroll patients into the studies according to schedule, or at all;\n\u2022 During the clinical trial, there could be unexpected serious adverse events causing severe injury or death in patients, requiring us to cease further enrollment or causing regulatory authorities to place the trial on clinical hold for an indefinite period of time;\n\u2022 If a clinical trial is completed, we may not have the appropriate personnel to submit a marketing application to regulatory authorities for approval, and to further respond to the variety of follow up questions that regulatory authorities may have during the review process;\n\u2022 Regulatory authorities may reject drug candidates for a variety of reasons, preventing us from proceeding with marketing and commercialization of approved products; and\n\u2022 We may run out of the funds necessary to complete development for any of our potential drug candidates.\nEven an effective drug candidate might not be commercially successful.\nEven if we ultimately succeed in creating a safe and effective drug, as determined by regulatory authorities, based on our current product pipeline, there is no assurance it would be commercially successful. Competitive products might become available faster or with lower costs or adverse risks to patients, resulting in few sales of any product developed by XBiotech. Occurrences of certain disease indications, such as those in our pipeline, might become sufficiently rare, or victims might be sufficiently impoverished, that commercial production is uneconomic. Furthermore, we must have sufficient buy-in from patients and healthcare professionals to guarantee market exposure for our drug candidates. If the end-users are not reached with our products, then it will be difficult to generate revenue from our development efforts. And even though we could obtain regulatory approval for any of our drug candidates, it is not necessarily the case that government or third-party payers will decide to add our products to their respective prescription drug formularies for reimbursement, thus inhibiting the ability for our drug candidates to reach the target patient populations, and health care professionals serving those patients.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our current or future product candidates to treat any relevant indication(s). There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the disease indications for which we are developing our future product candidates. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are the same as or similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches. Potential competitors include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.\nMore established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their greater size, cash flows and institutional experience. Compared to us, many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources. As a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products before we do, which will limit our ability to develop or commercialize any of our product candidates. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics to supplant or expand upon the standard of care for a number of diseases, as a result, we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development.\nOur failure to successfully identify, acquire, develop and commercialize additional product candidates or approved products could impair our ability to grow.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our efforts will focus on the continued clinical testing and potential approval of our current product candidates, a key element of our growth strategy is to acquire, develop and/or market additional products and product candidates. All of these potential product candidates remain in the discovery and clinical study stages. Research programs to identify product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources, whether or not any product candidates are ultimately identified. Because our internal research capabilities are limited, we may be dependent upon pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic scientists and other researchers to sell or license products or technology to us. The success of this strategy depends partly upon our ability to identify, select and acquire promising pharmaceutical product candidates and products. The process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a license or acquisition of a product candidate or approved product is lengthy and complex. Other companies, including some with substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, may compete with us for the license or acquisition of product candidates and approved products. We have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. Any product candidate that we acquire may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including extensive clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure typical of pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that any products that we develop or approved products that we acquire will be manufactured profitably or achieve market acceptance.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that we may develop. Product liability claims may be brought against us by subjects enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022 decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop;\n\u2022 termination of clinical trial sites or entire clinical trial programs;\n\u2022 injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022 significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022 substantial monetary awards to clinical trial subjects or patients;\n\u2022 loss of revenue;\n\u2022 diversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and\n\u2022 the inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe will obtain insurance coverage for products to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nWe will need to expand our operations and grow the size of our organization in the future, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of March 12, 2020, we had 60 employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, or as a result of any future acquisitions, we will need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, scientific, and financial headcount and other resources. Our management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support this future growth. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u2022 managing our clinical trials effectively, which we anticipate potentially being conducted at numerous clinical sites on a global scale;\n\u2022 identifying, recruiting, maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees with the expertise and experience we will require;\n\u2022 managing our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors and other third parties;\n\u2022 managing additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties;\n\u2022 improving our managerial, development, operational and finance reporting systems and procedures; and\n\u2022 expanding our facilities.\nOur failure to accomplish any of these tasks could prevent us from successfully growing our Company.\nWe have ongoing obligations to manufacture bermekimab for use by Janssen in clinical trials, and any failure to satisfy our obligations under that agreement would have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our financial condition and business reputation.\nIn connection with the Janssen Transaction, one of our subsidiaries entered into a clinical manufacturing agreement with an affiliate of Janssen, under which our subsidiary agreed to manufacture bermekimab for use by Janssen in clinical trials in return for quarterly cash payments. If we fail to manufacture bermekimab in sufficient quantities to satisfy our obligations under the clinical manufacturing agreement, we would be in breach of our contractual obligations, in which case Janssen could cease making payments to us and could also sue us for default. Any such litigation would be expensive and time-consuming and could damage our business reputation, causing potential business partners to be less willing to do business with us in the future. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may never achieve any of the potential milestone payments that were negotiated as a part of the Janssen Transaction.\nAs part of the Janssen Transaction, we are eligible to receive milestone payments of $150 million for each instance that Janssen, in its sole and absolute discretion, develops pharmaceutical products that contain bermekimab and that are for non-dermatological indications, provided that Janssen receives certain required commercial authorizations for such products within a specified timeframe. We are entitled to earn up to four milestone payments, for a maximum of $600 million. However, because the payment of these funds is subject to Janssen\u2019s business decisions and discretion, as well as regulatory approvals and other factors outside our control, we may never receive any of these amounts. If we do not receive all or any of the milestone payments, we may be required to seek additional funding from other sources, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nWe are highly dependent on our Chief Executive Officer.\nOur future success depends in significant part on the continued service of our Chief Executive Officer, John Simard. Mr. Simard is critical to the strategic direction and overall management of our company as well as our research and development process. Although we have an employment agreement with Mr. Simard, it has no specific duration. The loss of Mr. Simard could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and many members of our current management team are new. If we are unable to retain, attract and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\nIn addition to the continued services of Mr. Simard, we believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of our significant employees, as well as our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced sales, research and development and other personnel in the United States and abroad. Some of our significant employees include our Chief Scientific Officer, our Vice President of Quality Assurance, our Vice President of Quality Control, and our Vice President of Finance and Human Resources. Changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business.\nAll of our employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, are free to terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, subject to any applicable notice requirements, and their knowledge of our business and industry may be difficult to replace. If one or more of our executive officers or significant employees leaves, we may not be able to fully integrate new personnel or replicate the prior working relationships, and our operations could suffer. Qualified individuals with the breadth of skills and experience in the pharmaceutical industry that we require are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. Many of the other pharmaceutical companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Our failure to attract and retain key personnel could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the U.S. and elsewhere, including, as a result of our leased laboratory space, those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes.\nWe cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain insurance for employee injury to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may also result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nBusiness disruptions caused by natural disasters, infrastructure interruptions, coronavirus or other public health threats could seriously harm our future revenues and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages or outages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics such as contagious disease outbreaks, and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. We do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. We rely on third-parties to supply various items which are critical for producing our product candidates. Our ability to produce clinical supplies of product candidates could be disrupted, if the operations of these suppliers are affected by a man-made or natural disaster, a public health crisis or other business interruption. For example, the ongoing coronavirus threat has spread to a number of countries, including the United States and various countries in Europe, resulting in the declaration by the World Health Organization of a global pandemic and the announcement of extended travel restrictions, business shutdowns, cancellations and prohibitions of large public gatherings and declarations of states of emergency in cities, states and countries around the world. The imposition of any of these restrictions in one of the regions where our facilities or those of our third-party suppliers are located would have a disproportionately negative impact on us. The extent of the ultimate impact to us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure resulting from concentration in certain geographical areas is unknown and cannot be estimated, but our operations and financial condition would likely suffer in the event of a major earthquake, fire or other natural disaster or public health threat such as the coronavirus pandemic in one or more of those areas. Further, any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from future prospects.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality, licensing and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. Our commercial success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. Where we deem appropriate, we seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the U.S. and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patents, including those patent rights licensed to us by third parties, are highly uncertain.\nThe steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the U.S. The rights already granted under any of our currently issued patents and those that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking. If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected.\nWith respect to patent rights, we do not know whether our pending patent applications for any of our technologies or product candidates will result in the issuance of patents that protect such technologies or product candidates, or if any of our issued patents will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Our pending patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. Further, the examination process may require us to narrow the claims for our pending patent applications, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained if these applications issue. Because the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, issued patents that we own or have licensed from third parties may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the U.S. and abroad. Such challenges may result in the loss of patent protection, the narrowing of claims in such patents or the invalidity or unenforceability of such patents, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection for our technology and products. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our patented technology, trademarks and other intellectual property rights is expensive, difficult and, in some cases, not be possible. In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third-party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, even in relation to issued patent claims, and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to any competitive advantage we may have.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022 Others may be able to make compounds that are the same as or similar to our current or future product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u2022 We might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed.\n\u2022 We or any of our licensors or strategic partners might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions.\n\u2022 Others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights.\n\u2022 It is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents.\n\u2022 Issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors.\n\u2022 Our competitors might conduct research and development activities in the U.S. and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets.\n\u2022 We may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\n\u2022 The patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur technology may be found to infringe upon third-party intellectual property rights.\nThird parties, may in the future, assert claims or initiate litigation related to their patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights in technology that is important to us. The asserted claims and/or litigation could include claims against us, our licensors or our suppliers alleging infringement of intellectual property rights with respect to our products or components of those products. Regardless of the merit of the claims, they could be time consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. We cannot assure you that licenses will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Furthermore, because of the potential for significant damage awards, which are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims resulting in large settlements. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe upon the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to:\n\u2022 obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u2022 abandon an infringing drug or therapy candidate;\n\u2022 redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u2022 stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others;\n\u2022 pay damages; or\n\u2022 defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nWe may need to license intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development of our products. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of a third party to manufacture, or otherwise commercialize, our own technology or products, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from such third party. Licensing such intellectual property may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside of the U.S. are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Owning Shares of Our Common Stock\nOur share price may be volatile, which could subject us to securities class action lawsuits and prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased them.\nOur stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 results of our clinical trials;\n\u2022 results of clinical trials of our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022 regulatory actions with respect to our products or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our competitors\u2019 operating results or changes in their growth rate;\n\u2022 competition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n\u2022 announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u2022 issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u2022 fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022 delisting of the Company\u2019s common shares from the exchange on which they trade due to the Company not being in compliance with the listing requirements of the exchange;\n\u2022 share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key management or scientific personnel;\n\u2022 disputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022 announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022 sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other shareholders;\n\u2022 market conditions for biopharmaceutical stocks in general; and\n\u2022 general economic and market conditions.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, stock markets have experienced extreme volatility in the first quarter of 2020 due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and investor concerns and uncertainty related to the impact of the outbreak on the economies of countries worldwide. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of shares of our common stock. In addition, such fluctuations could subject us to securities class action litigation, which could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. If the market price of shares of our common stock does not exceed your buying price, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.\nOur recent cash tender offer may have lasting negative effects on the trading price and market liquidity of our common shares.\nWe experienced significant volatility in our stock price following the announcement of the Janssen Transaction and the commencement and completion of our modified Dutch auction tender offer for $420 million of our common shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price. The completion of the cash tender offer significantly reduced the number of our outstanding common shares, which may have an adverse effect on the future liquidity of the market for our common shares, as well as the trading price. A reduction in trading volume and liquidity may make it more difficult for you to sell your common shares at the time and for the price you expect. Price volatility related to the tender offer may continue for the foreseeable future.\nOur directors, executive officers and principal shareholders continue to have substantial control over our company and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nAs of February 29, 2020 our directors, executive officers and principal shareholders, together with their affiliates, beneficially own, in the aggregate, at least 7.5 million shares or approximately 26% of our outstanding common stock, and could own approximately 10.7 million shares or approximately 37% of our outstanding common stock if they fully exercise their outstanding stock options. As a result, these shareholders, if acting together, have the ability to determine the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these persons, acting together, have the ability to control the management and affairs of the Company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u2022 delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company;\n\u2022 impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving the Company; or\n\u2022 discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nWe have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from the Janssen Transaction and may not use them effectively.\nWe intend to continue to allocate the net proceeds that we received from our public offerings and the Janssen Transaction to fund discovery and development of our next generation True Human\u2122 anti-IL-1\u237a antibody program and to advance other antibody therapeutics in our pipeline. However, our management will have broad discretion in the actual application of the net proceeds, and we may elect to allocate proceeds differently if we believe it would be in our best interests to do so. For example, in February 2020, we completed a cash tender offer in which we repurchased $420 million of our common shares. Our shareholders may not agree with the manner in which our management chooses to allocate and spend the net proceeds. Our management may also fail to apply these funds effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may invest our cash on hand in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value.\nProvisions in our charter documents under Canadian law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our shareholders, more difficult.\nOur authorized preferred capital stock is available for issuance from time to time at the discretion of our Board of Directors, without shareholder approval. Our Articles of Incorporation (\u201cArticles\u201d) grant our Board of Directors the authority, subject to the corporate law of British Columbia, to determine or alter the special rights and restrictions granted to or imposed on any wholly unissued series of preferred shares, and such rights may be superior to those of our common stock.\nLimitations on the ability to acquire and hold our common stock may be imposed by the Competition Act (Canada). This legislation permits the Commissioner of Competition of Canada to review any acquisition of a significant interest in us. This legislation grants the Commissioner jurisdiction to challenge such an acquisition before the Canadian Competition Tribunal if the Commissioner believes that it would, or would be likely to, result in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition in any market in Canada. The Investment Canada Act (Canada) subjects an acquisition of control of a company by a non-Canadian to government review if the value of our assets as calculated pursuant to the legislation exceeds a threshold amount. A reviewable acquisition may not proceed unless the relevant minister is satisfied that the investment is likely to be a net benefit to Canada.\nAny of the foregoing could prevent or delay a change of control and may deprive or limit strategic opportunities for our shareholders to sell their shares and/or affect the market price of our shares.\nWe may be a passive foreign investment company for US tax purposes which may negatively affect US investors.\nFor US federal income taxation purposes, we will be a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) if in any taxable year either: (a) 75% or more of our gross income consists of passive income; or (b) 50% or more of the value of our assets is attributable to assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. If we meet either test, our shares held by a US person in that year will be PFIC shares for that year and all for subsequent years in which they are held by that person. In previous taxable years, we likely were a PFIC because our gross income consisted principally of interest. In 2019, however, the character of our gross income changed significantly as a result of the Janssen Transaction, and the determination of whether we were a PFIC in 2019 is uncertain. Moreover, the PFIC rules can apply differently to different US shareholders depending on whether a specific shareholder has made certain elections with respect to the ownership of PFIC shares. Because these rules are extremely complex and apply differently based upon whether and when a US shareholder has made certain elections, new and existing US shareholders should consult with their tax advisors as to the tax implications of acquiring, owning and disposing of our stock.\nWe are governed by the corporate laws in British Columbia, Canada which in some cases have a different effect on shareholders than the corporate laws in Delaware, United States.\nThe material differences between the BCBCA as compared to the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) which may be of most interest to shareholders include the following:\n(i) for material corporate transactions (i.e. mergers and amalgamations, other extraordinary corporate transactions, amendments to our Articles) the BCBCA generally requires two-thirds majority vote by shareholders, whereas DGCL generally only requires a majority vote of shareholders;\n(ii) the quorum for shareholders meetings is not prescribed under the BCBCA and is only two persons representing 20% of the issued shares under our Articles, whereas under DGCL, quorum requires a minimum of one-third of the shares entitled to vote to be present and companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation frequently require a higher percentage to be present;\n(iii) under the BCBCA, a holder of 5% or more of our common stock can requisition a special meeting at which any matters that can be voted on at our annual meeting can be considered, whereas the DGCL does not give this right;\n(iv) our Articles require two-thirds majority vote by shareholders to pass a resolution for one or more directors to be removed, whereas DGCL only requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders; however, many public company charters limit removal of directors to a removal for cause; and\n(v) our Articles may be amended by resolution of our directors to alter our authorized share structure, including to consolidate or subdivide any of our shares, whereas under DGCL, a majority vote by shareholders is generally required to amend a corporation\u2019s certificate of incorporation and a separate class vote may be required to authorize alterations to a corporation\u2019s authorized share structure.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because of these material differences. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our share price may be more volatile.\nFuture sales, or the possibility of future sales, of a substantial number of our common stock could adversely affect the price of the shares and dilute shareholders.\nFuture sales of a substantial number of our common stock, or the perception that such sales will occur, could cause a decline in the market price of our common stock. As of March 16, 2020, we had 28,852,927 common shares outstanding.\nIn the future, we may issue additional common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement, employee arrangements or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our existing shareholders and could cause our common share price to decline.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act) and we intend to take advantage of reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could result in our common stock being less attractive to investors and adversely affect the market price of our common stock or make it more difficult to raise capital as and when we need it.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as that term is used in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved and exemptions from any rules that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board may adopt requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report on the financial statements. We currently intend to take advantage of some, but not all, of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to us under the JOBS Act, so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d For example, so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may elect not to provide you with certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of our executive officers, that we would otherwise have been required to provide in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate the Company.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company, which in certain circumstances could be for up to five years.\nDue to the exemptions from various reporting requirements provided to us as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we may be less attractive to investors and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. Investors may be unable to compare our business with other companies in our industry if they believe that our financial statements are not as transparent as other companies in our industry. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and future prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, shareholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis and our management is required to assess the effectiveness of these controls annually. However, for as long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, or through the end of fiscal year 2020. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that our management\u2019s assessment might not.\nWe expect that we will no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d following December 31, 2020 and that we will incur significant additional costs once we no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nCommencing December 31, 2020, we will no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will no longer apply to us. As a result, we will no longer be permitted to take advantage of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements described above. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company, we expect to incur additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with those additional requirements applicable to companies that are not emerging growth companies, including the auditor attestation requirements for internal controls. Compliance with these additional laws, rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. In addition, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns and our costs and expenses will increase, which could harm our business and operating results. We may also need to hire more employees in the future or engage additional outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which will increase our costs and expenses.", "PERMNO": 15305, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "XBIT"}
