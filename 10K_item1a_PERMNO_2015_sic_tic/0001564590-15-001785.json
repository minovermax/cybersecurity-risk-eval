{"cik": "1466815", "company": "CAMBIUM LEARNING GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A Risk Factors.\nThis section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nRisks Related to our Business\nChanges in funding for public schools could cause the demand for our products to decrease.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from public schools, which are heavily dependent on federal, state and local government funding. Budget cuts, curtailments, delays, changes in leadership, shifts in priorities or general reductions in funding could reduce or delay our revenues. Funding difficulties experienced by schools could also cause those institutions to demand price reductions and could slow or reduce purchases of intervention products, which in turn could materially harm our business. Our business may be adversely affected by changes in educational funding at the federal, state or local level, resulting from changes in legislation, changes in state procurement processes, changes in government leadership, emergence of other funding or legislative priorities and changes in the condition of the local, state or U.S. economy.\nChanges in school procurement policies may adversely affect our business.\nThe school appropriations process is often slow, unpredictable and subject to many factors outside of our control. School districts choose to procure educational materials in various ways which can change quickly necessitating a change in our sales strategy or sales investments. Districts and states may switch procurement decisions from a centralized (district-wide) to a decentralized (school by school) decision, states may switch from state-wide standard adoptions to flexible district level procurement, and customers could increasingly utilize competitive requests for proposals (RFP) or procurement. Any of these changes could cause us to modify our sales strategy or cause us to expend greater sales effort to win business and if we are slow to respond the result could be a material loss of market share.\nOur business is anticipated to be seasonal and our operating results are anticipated to fluctuate seasonally.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. In addition, the quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past, and our quarterly results of operations can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. Our first quarter historically represents less than 15% of Bookings, which tend to build through the second quarter and peak during the third quarter, representing the preponderance of orders, revenue, and income each year.\nCertain of our activities are subject to weather risks, which could disrupt our operations or otherwise adversely affect our financial performance.\nWeather disruptions due to snowstorms, hurricanes, or tornadoes could result in school closures, resulting in reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products in it school channels during the affected periods. Additionally, the Company conducts certain of its businesses and maintains warehouse and office facilities in locations that are at risk of being negatively affected by severe weather events, such as snowstorms, hurricanes, tornadoes, or floods.\nOur intellectual property protection may be inadequate, which may allow others to use our intellectual property and thereby reduce our ability to compete.\nThe intellectual property underlying our services and products may be vulnerable to attack by our competitors. We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. The steps that we have taken in order to protect our proprietary intellectual property may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our assets or to prevent third parties from developing similar offerings independently.\nOur products could infringe on the intellectual property of others, which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and to pay substantial damages or restrict or prohibit us from selling our products.\nThird parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their intellectual property rights. If any of these claims are successful, we may be required to pay substantial damages, possibly including treble damages, for past infringement. We also may be prohibited from selling our products or providing certain content without first obtaining a license from the third party, which, if available at all, may require us to pay additional fees or royalties to the third party. Even if infringement claims against us are without merit, defending a lawsuit takes significant time, is often expensive and may divert management attention away from other business concerns.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified executives and management, as well as creative and technical personnel. Members of our senior management team have substantial industry experience that is critical to the execution of our business plan. If they or other key employees were to leave our company, and we were unable to find qualified and affordable replacements for these individuals, our business could be harmed materially.\nWe could experience system failures, software errors or capacity constraints, any of which would cause interruptions in the delivery of electronic content to customers and we could experience security breaches to our systems. The occurrence of any such systems failures and security breaches ultimately may cause us to lose customers.\nAny significant delays, disruptions or failures in the systems, or errors in the software, that we use for the technology-based component of our products, as well as for internal operations, could harm our business materially. We have occasionally suffered computer and telecommunication outages or related problems in the past. The growth of our customer base, as well as the number of websites we provide, could strain our systems in the future and will likely magnify the consequences of any computer and telecommunications problems that we may experience.\nHowever, destruction or disruption of data center sites could cause a system-wide failure. Although we maintain property insurance on these premises, claims for any system failure could exceed our coverage. In addition, our products could be affected by failures associated with third party hosting providers or by failures of third party technology used in our products, and we may have no control over remedying these failures.\nAdditionally, our systems and websites may be vulnerable to unauthorized access by hackers, computer viruses and other disruptive problems. Any security breaches or problems could lead to misappropriation of our customers\u2019 information, our websites, our intellectual property and other rights, as well as disruption in the use of our systems and websites. Any security breach related to our websites could tarnish our reputation and expose us to damages and litigation. We also may incur significant costs to maintain our security precautions or to correct problems caused by security breaches. Furthermore, to maintain these security measures, we may be required to monitor our customers\u2019 access to our websites, which may cause disruption to customers\u2019 use of our systems and websites. These disruptions and interruptions could harm our business materially.\nFederal and state regulation of education and student information is rapidly evolving. Our reputation is one of our most important assets, and any adverse events, such as data privacy breaches or violation of privacy laws or regulations, could cause significant reputational damage and could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nFederal and state regulations for privacy is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, display, processing, transmission and security of personal information by companies offering online services have recently come under increased public scrutiny.\nExamples of regulations that could be applicable to our company include the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), relating to access to and the use of information received from children in respect to our on-line offerings, and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which imposes parental or student consent requirements for specified disclosures of student information to third parties.\nAdverse publicity stemming from a data or privacy breach, whether or not valid, could reduce demand for our products or adversely affect our relationship with customers. Further, a failure to adequately protect personal data, including that of customers or students, or other data security failures, such as cyber-attacks from third parties, could lead to penalties, significant remediation costs and reputational damage, including loss of future business.\nWe have a single distribution center and could experience significant disruption of business and ultimately lose customers in the event it was damaged, destroyed or experienced technological failure.\nOur inventory and fulfillment operations are outsourced to an Ozburn Hessey Logistics (\u201cOHL\u201d) location in the St. Louis, Missouri area. In the event that these distribution facilities were damaged, destroyed or experienced technological failure, we would be delayed in responding to customer requests. Additionally, business disruptions within OHL that are out of our control could delay our ability to deliver printed materials to our customers in a timely manner. Customers often purchase materials very close to the school year and such delivery delays could cause our customers to turn to competitors for products they need immediately. While we maintain adequate property insurance, the loss of customers could have a long-term, detrimental impact on our reputation and business.\nCustomer acceptance of our products could be impacted by changing educational standards.\nCustomer acceptance of our products may be impacted by changing educational standards, such as the adoption of Common Core or other rigorous state standards. While there could be opportunity for us, if customer acceptance of our products is negatively impacted by changing educational standards, our sales could decline or we may be required to expend more on investments in product development than planned.\nRisks Related to Debt and Ownership of our Common Stock\nWe do not foresee paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, as a result, our investors\u2019 sole source of gain, if any, will depend on capital appreciation, if any.\nWe do not plan to declare or pay any cash dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future and currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, for future operation, debt reduction and expansion. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, restrictions imposed by applicable law, business and investment strategy, contractual limitations and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur, including the 9.75% senior secured notes (described below). As a result, our stockholders may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless they sell our common stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it. Moreover, investors may not be able to resell their shares of the Company at or above the price they paid for them.\nThe existence of a majority stockholder may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could delay, hinder or prevent a change in corporate control or result in the entrenchment of management and the board of directors, and our majority stockholder has a contractual right to maintain its percentage ownership in our company.\nVSS-Cambium Holdings III, LLC, owns a majority of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, VSS-Cambium Holdings III, LLC will likely have the ability to determine the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all our assets. In addition, VSS-Cambium Holdings III, LLC will likely have the ability to control our management, affairs and operations. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may harm the market price of our common stock by delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control or impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination.\nThe ownership of a large block of stock by a single stockholder may reduce our market liquidity. Should VSS-Cambium Holdings III, LLC determine to sell any of its position in the future, sales of substantial amounts of our common stock on the market, or even the possibility of these sales, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. These sales, or even the possibility of these sales, also may make it more difficult for us to raise capital through the issuance of equity securities at a time and at a price we deem appropriate.\nMoreover, VSS-Cambium Holdings III, LLC has a contractual right to maintain its percentage ownership in our company. Specifically, under the terms of a stockholders agreement entered into in connection with the mergers, if we were to engage in a new issuance of our securities, VSS-Cambium Holdings III, LLC and funds managed or controlled by VSS would have preemptive rights to purchase an amount of our securities that would enable them to maintain their same collective percentage of ownership in our company following the new issuance. VSS-Cambium Holdings III, LLC and funds managed or controlled by VSS would have these preemptive rights for so long as those entities collectively beneficially own, in the aggregate, at least 25% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Thus, while other holders of our securities would risk suffering a reduction in percentage ownership in connection\nwith a new issuance of securities by us, VSS-Cambium Holdings III, LLC and funds managed or controlled by VSS would, through this preemptive right, have the opportunity to avoid a reduction in percentage ownership.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from various corporate governance standards, which limits the presence of independent directors on our board of directors and board committees.\nDue to the fact that VSS-Cambium Holdings III, LLC owns a majority of our outstanding common stock, we are deemed a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d for purposes of NASDAQ Rule 5615(c)(2). Under this rule, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and is exempt from certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, including requirements that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors, that compensation of officers be determined or recommended to the board of directors by a majority of independent directors or by a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors and that director nominees be selected or recommended for selection by a majority of the independent directors or by a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors. We intend to rely upon these exemptions. Accordingly, our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of other companies that are required to comply fully with the NASDAQ rules.\nSince the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption does not extend to the composition of audit committees, we are required to have an audit committee that consists of at least three directors, each of whom must be \u201cindependent\u201d based on independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). Our board of directors has adopted an audit committee charter which will govern our audit committee. These three directors must also satisfy the requirements set forth in NASDAQ Rule 5605(a) and (c). The audit committee is currently composed entirely of independent directors.\nProvisions of our organizational documents and Delaware law may delay or deter a change of control.\nOur organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of, or unsolicited acquisition proposals for, our company. These include provisions that:\n\u00b7\nvest our board of directors with the sole power to set the number of directors of our company;\n\u00b7\nlimit the persons that may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations; and\n\u00b7\nlimit stockholder action by written consent.\nAlso, our board of directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares, all without stockholder approval. Any series of preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends, liquidation rights and, possibly, voting rights. The ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock also could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals, thus adversely affecting the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, Delaware corporate law makes it difficult for stockholders that recently have acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the directors\u2019 wishes. Under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), a Delaware corporation such as our company may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder or such stockholder\u2019s affiliates or associates for a period of three years following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, except in limited circumstances, including by approval of the corporation\u2019s board of directors.\nWe have a significant amount of senior secured debt and will have the obligation to make interest payments and comply with restrictions contained in the credit agreements with our senior secured lenders.\nWe have $140.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of 9.75% senior secured notes due 2017.\nWe are subject to risks associated with substantial indebtedness, including the risk that we will not be able to refinance existing indebtedness when it becomes due, the risk that we would not be able to secure alternative financing if we are unable to comply with the debt covenants or if we were to experience an event of default, and the risk that our cash flows from operations are insufficient to make scheduled interest payments. We are required to make interest payments semi-annually in arrears on each February 15th and August 15th. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our debt. However, we may not be able to obtain any such new or additional financing on favorable terms or at all.\nThe indenture governing the notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; pay dividends and make other restricted payments; incur restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions from our restricted subsidiaries; create or incur certain liens; make certain investments; transfer or sell assets; enter into operating leases; engage in transactions with affiliates; and merge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our or our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 assets.\nFurther, upon the occurrence of specific types of change of control events, we will be required to offer to repurchase outstanding notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The source of funds for any such purchase of the notes will be our available cash or cash generated from our and our subsidiaries\u2019 operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. Our failure to repurchase the notes upon a change of control would cause a default under the indenture governing the notes and a cross default under our revolving credit facility.", "PERMNO": 93188, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "ABCD"}
