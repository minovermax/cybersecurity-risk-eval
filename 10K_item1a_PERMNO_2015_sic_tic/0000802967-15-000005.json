RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in connection with evaluating our business and prospects. The occurrence of any of the events described below could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nConditions in the housing market, consumer credit market and economic conditions generally could adversely affect demand for our products.\nOur business is largely dependent on home improvement (including repair and remodeling) and new home construction activity levels in the United States and Canada. Adverse conditions in, or sustained uncertainty about, our industry or the overall economy (including inflation, deflation, interest rates, availability and cost of capital, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs, and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions) could adversely impact consumer confidence, causing our customers to delay purchasing or determine not to purchase home improvement products and services. High unemployment, low consumer confidence, declining home prices, increased mortgage rates and tightened credit markets may limit the ability of consumers to purchase homes or to finance home improvements and may negatively affect investments in existing homes in the form of renovations and home improvements. These industry conditions and general economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur focus within the building products industry amplifies the risks inherent in a general economic downturn. The impact of this weakness on our net sales, net income and margins will be determined by many factors, including industry capacity, industry pricing and our ability to implement our business plan.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which requires significant interest payments. As of January 3, 2015, we had $903.4 million of indebtedness, and interest expense, net, for the year ended January 3, 2015 was $82.5 million.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nWe must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facilities (\u201cABL facilities\u201d) and 9.125% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the \u201c9.125% notes\u201d) and other indebtedness, which reduces funds available to us for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, other general corporate purposes and potential acquisitions;\n\u2022\nour ability to refinance such indebtedness or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impacted;\n\u2022\nwe are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates because the ABL facilities have a variable rate of interest;\n\u2022\nour leverage may be greater than that of some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in responding to current and changing industry and financial market conditions;\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business; and\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants in the ABL facilities, the indenture governing the 9.125% notes (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) and other debt instruments, some of which require the obligor to maintain specified financial ratios and limit our ability to incur additional debt and sell assets, which could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects and could result in bankruptcy.\nOur ability to access funding under the ABL facilities depends upon, among other things, the absence of a default under the ABL facilities, including any default arising from a failure to comply with the related covenants. If we are unable to comply with our covenants under the ABL facilities, our liquidity may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to meet expenses, to remain in compliance with our covenants under our debt instruments and to make future principal and interest payments in respect of our debt depends on, among other things, our operating performance, competitive developments and financial market conditions, all of which are significantly affected by financial, business, economic and other factors. We are not able to control many of these factors. If industry and economic conditions deteriorate, our cash flow may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations.\nThe Indenture and the ABL facilities impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us.\nThe Indenture and the ABL facilities, as applicable, impose, and the terms of any future debt may impose, significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions, among other things, limit our ability and that of our subsidiaries to:\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions, repurchase equity, prepay junior debt and make certain investments;\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or issue certain disqualified stock and preferred stock;\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nincur liens on assets;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that would restrict our subsidiaries from paying dividends or making other payments to us.\nIn addition, as discussed under Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Description of Our Outstanding Indebtedness,\u201d if our borrowing availability under the ABL facilities is below specified levels, we will be subject to compliance with a fixed charge coverage ratio. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of January 3, 2015.\nAll of these covenants may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, meet or otherwise address our capital needs, pursue business opportunities, react to market conditions or otherwise restrict activities or business plans. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness. If repayment of our indebtedness is accelerated as a result of such default, we cannot provide any assurance that we would have sufficient assets or access to credit to repay such indebtedness.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash, or access capital resources, to service all of our debt obligations, working capital needs and planned capital expenditures and may be forced to take actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and liquidity.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations, fund working capital needs and make planned capital expenditures depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to seasonal fluctuations and general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in an amount sufficient to satisfy our debt obligations, working\ncapital needs and capital expenditures. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund such obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies, including reducing or delaying investments and capital expenditures, selling assets, seeking additional capital or restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and could cause us to not meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ABL facilities also require us to satisfy specified covenants, which, if triggered, could result in the acceleration of the amounts due thereunder or force us to seek a waiver or amendment with the lenders under our ABL facilities. No assurance can be given that we would be able to obtain any necessary waivers or amendments on satisfactory terms. In addition, our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future is dependent on many factors, such as our financial performance, our credit ratings, general economic conditions, including the housing market, and the liquidity of overall debt markets. If we are not able to access to the debt markets on terms acceptable to us, our business, future growth prospects and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nDisruption in the financial markets could negatively affect us as well as our customers and suppliers, and the inability to access financing on terms and at a time acceptable to us for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nAlong with our customers and suppliers, we rely on stable and efficient financial markets. Availability of financing depends on the lending practices of financial institutions, financial and credit markets, government policies and economic conditions, all of which are beyond our control. Adverse economic conditions and disrupted financial markets, characterized by persistently high unemployment rates, weakness in many real estate markets, global economic turmoil, limitations on credit availability and growing debt loads for many governments, could compromise the financial condition of our customers and suppliers. In such case, customers may not be able to pay, or may delay payment of, accounts receivable due to liquidity and financial performance issues or concerns affecting them or due to their inability to secure financing. Suppliers may modify, delay or cancel projects and reduce their levels of business with us. In addition, weak credit markets may also impact the ability of the end consumer to obtain any needed financing to purchase our products, resulting in a reduction in overall demand, and consequently negatively impact our sales levels. Further volatility and disruption in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to refinance indebtedness when required and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and competitive pressures could have an adverse effect on us.\nThe markets for our products and services are highly competitive. We seek to distinguish ourselves from other suppliers of residential building products and to sustain our profitability through a business strategy focused on increasing sales at existing supply centers, selectively expanding our supply center network, increasing sales through independent specialty distributor customers, developing innovative new products, expanding sales of third-party manufactured products through our supply center network and driving operational excellence by reducing costs and increasing customer service levels. We believe that competition in the industry is based on price, product and service quality, customer service, and product features. Sustained increases in competitive pressures could have an adverse effect on results of operations and negatively impact sales and margins.\nWe have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, operating income is sensitive to changes in net sales.\nWe operate with significant operating and financial leverage. Significant portions of our manufacturing, selling, general and administrative expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with sales. In addition, a significant portion of our interest expense is fixed. There can be no assurance that we would be able to further reduce our fixed costs in response to a decline in net sales. As a result, a decline in our net sales could result in a higher percentage decline in our income from operations.\nWe may not successfully develop new products or improve existing products, and we may experience delays in the development of new products.\nOur success depends on meeting customer needs, and one of the ways in which we meet customer needs is through new product development. We aim to introduce products and new or improved production processes proactively to offset obsolescence and decreases in sales of existing products. As materials technology for exterior residential building products advances, we will be expected to upgrade and adapt our existing products and production processes and introduce new products in order to continue to provide products incorporating the latest commercial innovations and meet customer expectations.\nWhile we devote significant attention to the development of new products, we may not be successful in new product development, and our new products may not meet customer expectations or be commercially successful. To the extent we are not able to successfully develop new products, our future sales could be harmed. In addition, interruptions or delays in the\ndevelopment of new products and new or improved production processes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in raw material costs and interruptions in the availability of raw materials and finished goods could adversely affect our profit margins.\nThe principal raw materials used by us are vinyl resin, aluminum, steel, resin stabilizers and pigments, glass, window hardware, and packaging materials, all of which have historically been subject to price changes. Raw material pricing on certain of our key commodities has fluctuated significantly over the past several years, but has generally increased. In response, we have announced price increases over the past several years on certain of our product offerings to offset inflation in raw materials and continually monitor market conditions for price changes as warranted. Our ability to maintain gross margin levels on our products during periods of rising raw material costs depends on our ability to obtain increases in the selling price of our products. Furthermore, the results of operations for individual quarters can and have been negatively impacted by a delay between the timing of raw material cost increases and price increases on our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the selling price increases already implemented or achieve any future price increases.\nAdditionally, we rely on our suppliers for deliveries of raw materials and finished goods. If any of our suppliers were unable to deliver raw materials or finished goods to us for an extended period of time, we may not be able to procure the required raw materials or finished goods through other suppliers without incurring an adverse impact on our operations. Even if acceptable alternatives were found, the process of locating and securing such alternatives might be disruptive to our business, and any such alternatives could result in increased costs for us. Extended unavailability of necessary raw materials or finished goods could cause us to cease manufacturing or distributing one or more of our products for an extended period of time.\nConsolidation of our customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThough larger customers can offer efficiencies and unique product opportunities, consolidation increases their size and importance to our business. These larger customers can make significant changes in their volume of purchases and seek price reductions. Consolidation could adversely affect our margins and profitability, particularly if we were to lose a significant customer. Sales to one customer and its licensees represented approximately 14% of net sales in 2014 and approximately 13% of total net sales in each of 2013 and 2012. The loss of a substantial portion of sales to this customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in union organizing activity and work stoppages at our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers could delay or impede our production, reduce sales of our products and increase our costs.\nOur financial performance is affected by the cost of labor. As of January 3, 2015, excluding leased employees, approximately 17% of our employees were represented by labor unions. We are subject to the risk that strikes or other types of conflicts with personnel may arise or that we may become a subject of union organizing activity. Furthermore, some of our direct and indirect suppliers have unionized work forces. Strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by these suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures of facilities where components of our products are manufactured. Any interruption in the production or delivery of our products could reduce sales of our products and increase our costs.\nOur business is seasonal and can be affected by inclement weather conditions, which could affect the timing of the demand for our products and cause reduced profit margins and adversely affect our financial condition when such conditions exist.\nBecause most of our building products are intended for exterior use, our sales and operating profits tend to be lower during periods of inclement weather. Weather conditions in the first quarter of each calendar year usually result in that quarter producing significantly less net sales and net cash flows from operations than in any other period of the year. Consequently, we have historically had losses or small profits in the first quarter and lower profits from operations in the fourth quarter of each calendar year. To meet seasonal cash flow needs during the periods of reduced sales and net cash flows from operations, we have typically utilized our revolving credit facilities and repay such borrowings in periods of higher cash flow. We typically generate the majority of our cash flow in the third and fourth quarters. Our inability to meet our seasonal cash flow needs because of inclement weather conditions or any other reason could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not maintain profitability in the future.\nWe have not been consistently profitable on a quarterly or annual basis. We experienced net losses of $293.7 million and $33.5 million during the years ended January 3, 2015 and December 28, 2013, respectively. As of January 3, 2015, our accumulated deficit was $633.4 million. We may not be able to sustain or increase our growth or profitability in the future. We\nmay incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods. If these losses exceed our expectations or our growth expectations are not met in future periods, our financial performance will be affected adversely.\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and key employees. Their motivation, skills, experience and industry contacts significantly benefit our operations and administration. The failure to attract, motivate and retain members of our senior management and key employees could have a negative effect on our results of operations. In particular, the departure of members of our senior management could cause us to lose customers and reduce our net sales, lead to employee morale problems and the loss of key employees, or cause production disruptions.\nThe obligations under the Indenture and the ABL facilities are secured by substantially all of the assets of our operating subsidiaries, including a pledge of the capital stock of such subsidiaries.\nThe obligations of our operating subsidiaries under the Indenture and the ABL facilities are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the present and future property and assets of such subsidiaries, including a security interest in the capital stock of such subsidiaries. If we were in default under the Indenture or the ABL facilities, the holders of the 9.125% notes or the lenders under the ABL facilities may foreclose on their collateral security under the Indenture and the ABL facilities, including substantially all of the assets of our operating subsidiaries as well as the capital stock of such operating subsidiaries. In any such event, it is possible that there would be no or limited assets remaining. See Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Description of Our Outstanding Indebtedness\u201d for more information.\nWe have significant goodwill and other intangible assets, which if impaired, could require us to incur significant charges.\nAs of January 3, 2015, we had $317.3 million of goodwill and $437.3 million of other intangible assets. The value of these assets is dependent, among other things, upon our future expected operating results. We are required to test for impairment of these assets annually or when factors indicating impairment are present, which could result in a write down of all or a significant portion of these assets. Any future write down of goodwill and other intangible assets could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and on the results of operations for the period in which the impairment charge is incurred. During 2014, we recorded an impairment charge, including goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, of $233.9 million. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nThe future recognition of our deferred tax assets is uncertain, and assumptions used to determine the amount of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance are subject to revision based on changes in tax laws and variances between future expected operating performance and actual results.\nOur inability to realize deferred tax assets may have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. We evaluate our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on available evidence, including assumptions about future profitability.\nOur valuation allowance is estimated based on the uncertainty of the future realization of deferred tax assets. This reflects our assessment that a portion of our deferred tax assets could expire unused if we are unable to generate taxable income in the future sufficient to utilize them or we enter into one or more transactions that limit our ability to realize all of our deferred tax assets. The assumptions used to make this determination are subject to revision based on changes in tax laws or variances between our future expected operating performance and actual results. As a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance. If we determine that we would not be able to realize an additional portion of the deferred tax assets in the future, we would further reduce our deferred tax asset through a charge to earnings in the period in which the determination was made. Any such net charge could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to foreign exchange risk as a result of exposures to changes in currency exchange rates between the United States and Canada.\nWe are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar. We realize revenues from sales made through our Canadian distribution centers in Canadian dollars. The exchange rate of the Canadian dollar to the U.S. dollar has fluctuated in recent years. In the event that the Canadian dollar weakens in comparison to the U.S. dollar, earnings\ngenerated from Canadian operations will translate into reduced earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss reported in U.S. dollars. In addition, our Canadian subsidiary also records certain accounts receivable and accounts payable, which are denominated in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency transactional gains and losses are realized upon settlement of these assets and obligations. For more information, please see Item 7A. \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk.\u201d\nWe are controlled by investment funds affiliated with Hellman & Friedman LLC, whose interests may be different than the interests of other holders of our securities.\nBy reason of their majority ownership interest in Parent, which is our indirect parent company, the H&F Investors have the ability to designate a majority of the members of our board of directors (the \u201cBoard of Directors\u201d). The H&F Investors are able to control actions to be taken by us, including future issuances of our securities, the payment of dividends, if any, on our securities, amendments to our organizational documents and the approval of significant corporate transactions, including mergers, sales of substantially all of our assets, distributions of our assets, the incurrence of indebtedness and any incurrence of liens on our assets. The interests of the H&F Investors may be materially different than the interests of our other stakeholders. In addition, the H&F Investors may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to our other stakeholders. For example, the H&F Investors may cause us to take actions or pursue strategies that could impact our ability to make payments under the Indenture and the ABL facilities or that cause a change of control. In addition, to the extent permitted by the Indenture and the ABL facilities, the H&F Investors may cause us to pay dividends rather than make capital expenditures or repay debt. The H&F Investors are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. The H&F Investors also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as the H&F Investors continue to own a significant amount of the combined voting power of Parent, even if such amount is less than 50%, they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions and, so long as the H&F Investors continue to own shares of Parent\u2019s outstanding common stock, designate individuals to Parent\u2019s board of directors pursuant to a stockholders agreement (the \u201cStockholders Agreement\u201d) entered into in connection with the Merger on October 13, 2010, by and among Parent, Holdings, us, the H&F Investors and each member of our management and Board of Directors that held shares of common stock or options of Parent at that date. The members of our Board of Directors have been determined by action of Holdings, our sole member and a 100% owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent has designated the members of its board of directors to also be the members of each of Holdings\u2019 and our board of directors. In addition, the H&F Investors will be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval and will be able to cause or prevent a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our board of directors and could preclude any unsolicited acquisition of our company. For a discussion regarding the Stockholders Agreement, please refer to Item 13. \u201cCertain Relationships, Related Transactions and Director Independence - Stockholders Agreement.\u201d\nFailure of certain of our information technology system could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe rely on certain information technology systems to process, transmit, store, and protect electronic information. Furthermore, communications between our personnel, customers, and suppliers is largely dependent on information technology. Our information technology systems could be interrupted as a result of events that may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, telecommunications failures, additional security issues, and other technological failures. Our technology and information security processes and disaster recovery plans may not be adequate, or implemented properly, to ensure that our operations are not disrupted. In addition, while our information technology systems are current, underinvestment in our technology solutions as technology advances could result in disruptions in our business.\nWe could face potential product liability claims relating to products we manufacture or distribute.\nWe face a business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or other adverse effects. We currently maintain product liability insurance coverage, but we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential claims. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert management and other personnel for months or years regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful product liability defense could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or business prospects or ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due.\nWe rely on a variety of intellectual property rights. Any threat to, or impairment of, these rights could cause us to incur costs to defend these rights.\nAs a company that manufactures and markets branded products, we rely heavily on trademark and service mark protection to protect our brands. We also have issued patents and rely on trade secret and copyright protection for certain of our technologies. These protections may not adequately safeguard our intellectual property, and we may incur significant costs to defend our intellectual property rights, which may harm our operating results. There is a risk that third parties, including our current competitors, will infringe on our intellectual property rights, in which case we would have to defend these rights. There is also a risk that third parties, including our current competitors, will claim that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights. These third parties may bring infringement claims against us or our customers, which may harm our operating results.\nIncreases in freight costs could cause our cost of products sold to increase and net income to decrease.\nIncreases in freight costs can negatively impact our cost to deliver our products to our company-operated supply centers and customers and thus increase our cost of products sold. Freight costs are strongly correlated to oil prices, and increases in fuel prices, surcharges and other factors have increased freight costs and may continue to increase freight costs in the future. As we incur substantial freight costs to transport materials and components from our suppliers and to deliver finished products to our company-operated supply centers and customers, an increase in freight costs could increase our operating costs, which we may be unable to pass to our customers. If we are unable to increase the selling price of our products to our customers to cover any increases in freight costs, our net income may be adversely affected.\nWe may incur significant, unanticipated warranty claims.\nConsistent with industry practice, we provide to homeowners limited warranties on certain products. Warranties are provided for varying lengths of time, from the date of purchase up to and including lifetime. Warranties cover product failures such as seal failures for windows and fading and peeling for siding products, as well as manufacturing defects. Warranty reserves are established annually based on management\u2019s estimates of future warranty costs, which are primarily based on a third-party actuarial review of historical trends and sales of products to which such costs relate. To the extent that our estimates are inaccurate and we do not have adequate warranty reserves, our liability for warranty payments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nPotential liabilities and costs from litigation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are, from time to time, involved in various claims, litigation matters and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and that could have a material adverse effect on us. These matters may include contract disputes, personal injury claims, warranty disputes, environmental claims or proceedings, other tort claims, employment and tax matters and other proceedings and litigation, including class actions.\nIncreasingly, home builders, including our customers, are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims in the ordinary course of their business. Our contractual arrangements with these customers typically include an agreement to indemnify them against liability for the performance of our products or services or the performance of other products that we install. These claims, often asserted several years after completion of construction, frequently result in lawsuits against the home builders and many of their subcontractors and suppliers, including us, requiring us to incur defense costs even when our products or services may not be the principal basis for the claims.\nAlthough we intend to defend all claims and litigation matters vigorously, given the inherently unpredictable nature of claims and litigation, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or litigation matter, and there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any such matter.\nWe maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. The levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities. If any significant accident, judgment, claim or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various environmental statutes and regulations, which may result in significant costs and liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to various U.S. and Canadian environmental statutes and regulations, including those relating to: materials used in our products and operations; discharge of pollutants into the air, water and soil; treatment, transport,\nstorage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination. Such laws and regulations may also impact the cost and availability of materials used in manufacturing our products. Our facilities are subject to investigations by governmental regulators, which occur from time to time. While our management does not currently expect the costs of compliance with environmental requirements to increase materially, future expenditures may increase as compliance standards and technology change.\nAlso, we cannot be certain that we have identified all environmental matters giving rise to potential liability. Our past use of hazardous materials, releases of hazardous substances at or from currently or formerly owned or operated properties, newly discovered contamination at any of our current or formerly-owned or operated properties or at off-site locations such as waste treatment or disposal facilities, more stringent future environmental requirements (or stricter enforcement of existing requirements) or our inability to enforce indemnification agreements could result in increased expenditures or liabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. For further details regarding environmental matters giving rise to potential liability, see Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nLegislative or regulatory initiatives related to global warming / climate change concerns may negatively impact our business.\nIn recent years, there has been an increasing focus on global climate change, including increased attention from regulatory agencies and legislative bodies. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an unspecified array of environmental matters. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts in the U.S. to combat climate change could result in future increases in taxes and the cost of raw materials, transportation and utilities for us and our suppliers, which would result in higher operating costs for us. However, our management is unable to predict at this time the potential effects, if any, that any future environmental initiatives may have on our business.\nAdditionally, the recent legislative and regulatory responses related to climate change could create financial risk. Many governing bodies have been considering various forms of legislation related to greenhouse gas emissions. Increased public awareness and concern may result in more laws and regulations requiring reductions in or mitigation of the emission of greenhouse gases. Our facilities may be subject to regulation under climate change policies introduced within the next few years. There is a possibility that, when and if enacted, the final form of such legislation could increase our costs of compliance with environmental laws. If we are unable to recover all costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nDeclining returns in the investment portfolio of our defined benefit pension plans and changes in actuarial assumptions could increase the volatility in our pension expense and require us to increase cash contributions to the plans.\nWe sponsor a number of defined benefit pension plans for our employees in the United States and Canada. Pension expense for the defined benefit pension plans sponsored by us is determined based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including expected long-term rates of return on assets and discount rates. The use of these assumptions makes our pension expense and cash contributions subject to year-to-year volatility. Declines in market conditions, changes in pension law and uncertainties regarding significant assumptions used in the actuarial valuations can have a material impact on future required contributions to our pension plans and could result in additional charges to equity and an increase in future pension expense and cash contributions.\nWe may not be able to consummate and effectively integrate future acquisitions, if any.\nWe may from time to time engage in strategic acquisitions if we determine that they will provide future financial and operational benefits. Successful completion of any strategic transaction depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control, including our ability to negotiate acceptable terms, conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. In addition, our ability to effectively integrate any potential acquisitions into our existing business and culture may not be successful, which could jeopardize future operational performance for the combined businesses.", "PERMNO": 85847, "SIC": 3089, "TIC": "0084A"}
