{"cik": "1013606", "company": "ENDOLOGIX INC /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nBefore deciding to invest in our company, or to maintain or increase your investment, you should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other reports we have filed with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also affect our business operations. If any of these risks are realized, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be seriously harmed and, in that event, the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nThese risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nAll of our revenue is generated from a limited number of products, and any decline in the sales of these products, including as a result of negative perceptions regarding our financial stability, or any material departure in expected revenues from our products as against forecasts, will negatively impact our business.\nWe have focused heavily on the development and commercialization of a limited number of products for the treatment of AAA. If we are unable to continue to achieve and maintain market acceptance of these products and do not achieve sustained positive cash flow from operations, we will be constrained in our ability to fund development and commercialization of improvements and other product lines. In addition, if we are unable to market our products as a result of a manufacturing or quality problem or failure to maintain regulatory approvals, we would lose our only source of revenue and our business would be negatively affected. For example, we recently engaged in a voluntary commercial withdrawal of our Nellix EVAS System, which resulted in the removal of 2019 Nellix-related revenue from our financial forecasts. We currently anticipate that the Nellix EVAS System will only be available at approved centers in a clinical investigation setting with all cases pre-screened by a physician panel to ensure adherence to protocol and use in accordance with current product indications.\nWe may not succeed in commercializing our products for several reasons, including:\n\u2022\nphysicians and hospitals may continue relying on (or revert back to) open surgical repair, or use the other approved EVAR devices available for patients;\n\u2022\nour direct sales force may not be large enough, or effective enough in its efforts, to train and educate physicians and hospitals about the benefits of our products so as to drive adoption and continued use of our products;\n\u2022\ncoverage and reimbursement for our products may not be sufficient for customers to choose our devices when in need of an EVAR device;\n\u2022\nchallenges in the manufacturing, validation and testing of our products may require us to take actions that delay or otherwise hinder new product introductions or that impact currently available products;\n\u2022\nnew technologies, or improved products by competitors, may limit or reduce adoption and use of our products;\n\u2022\nclinical results associated with our products may not be deemed sufficient by us or applicable regulatory authorities to support the approval or commercial use of such products, or may not be sufficiently robust to drive widespread adoption or use;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory or other governmental statements, findings or reports regarding our products, specifically, our EVAR or EVAS technology and products may adversely affect the regulatory status and market for our products generally; and\n\u2022\nnegative publicity about, or actual or perceived problems with our products or with EVAR or EVAS devices and technologies generally, could discourage physician and hospital adoption or use of our products.\nIf we are unable to educate physicians and hospitals about the advantages of our products, do not achieve significantly greater market acceptance of our products, do not obtain or maintain required regulatory approvals for our products, do not regain momentum in our sales activities, or fail to significantly grow our market share, we will not be able to grow our revenue and our business and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, sales of our products may be adversely impacted by negative perceptions regarding our financial stability relative to that of our competitors and our ability to sustain our business operations on a long-term basis. We have entered into certain material agreements to consummate a substantial equity financing and to restructure our unsecured convertible indebtedness and secured term loan indebtedness that would materially address negative perceptions of our stability, but we cannot assure that these transactions will be consummated on terms currently stated, or at all. If we are unable to access substantial additional capital or restructure our indebtedness, we may continue to suffer from negative perceptions as to our financial stability and prospects. Further, our technical, human and other resources and capabilities, as well as our revenues and market share, are considerably smaller than those of our principal competitors. Negative perceptions of our financial stability, and resources and market share limitations, may cause our customers, suppliers and strategic partners, as well as independent distributors and third party payors, to question our ability to continue to sell our products, provide customer service, support our commercial organization and fulfill our strategic objectives. These concerns may arise from a number of factors, including our recent and projected financial results, our recent and projected cash positions, recent changes in and volatility of our stock price, perceptions about the dilutive impact of our financing transactions, our current level of indebtedness and debt service costs, the competitive environment in our industry, and uncertainties regarding the regulatory environment. Any such concerns, whether actual or perceived, could cause customers to delay the purchase of our products or purchase our competitors\u2019 products.\nIf we fail to develop and retain our direct sales force, our business could suffer.\nWe have a direct sales force in the United States and in certain European countries. As we launch new products and increase our marketing efforts with respect to existing products, we will need to retain and develop our direct sales personnel to build upon their experience with our products and their relationships with customers. There is significant competition for sales personnel with experience in relevant medical device sales, and departure of high-performing sales personnel can lead to loss of revenue. If we are unable to attract, motivate and develop qualified sales personnel and thereby grow our sales force, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenue. Further, if we are unable to retain the high-performing members of our sales force, we may suffer loss of revenues that may not be recoverable in the near-term or at all. Also, if our sales personnel are not sufficiently trained or qualified to successfully market and sell our products in our targeted markets and accounts, our sales results and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nWe are in a highly competitive market segment, which is subject to rapid technological change. If our competitors are better able to develop and market products that are safer, more effective, less costly, easier to use, or otherwise more attractive than the products that we may develop, our business will be adversely impacted.\nOur industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to maintain a competitive position in the development of technologies and products for use in the treatment of AAA. We face competition from both established and development stage companies. Many of the companies developing or marketing competing products enjoy several advantages over us, including:\n\u2022\ngreater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing and patent litigation;\n\u2022\ngreater name recognition;\n\u2022\nlong established relationships with physicians, customers, and third party payors;\n\u2022\nadditional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or incentives;\n\u2022\nmore established sales and marketing programs, and distribution networks;\n\u2022\ngreater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, clinical trials, preparing regulatory submissions, and obtaining regulatory clearance or approval for products and marketing approved products; and\n\u2022\ngreater buying power and influence with suppliers.\nOur competitors may develop and patent processes or products earlier than us, obtain regulatory clearance or approvals for competing products more rapidly than us, and develop more effective or less expensive products or technologies that render our technology or products obsolete or less competitive. We also face fierce competition in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales, and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment in clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our products or advantageous to our business. If our competitors are more successful than us in these matters, our business may be harmed.\nIf third party payors do not provide reimbursement for the use of our products, our revenue may be negatively impacted.\nOur success in marketing our products depends in large part on whether domestic and international government health administrative authorities, private health insurers and other organizations will reimburse customers for the cost of our products. Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries, and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. Further, many international markets have government-managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new devices and procedures. In most markets, there are private insurance systems as well as government-managed systems. In the United States, the healthcare industry is increasingly focused on cost containment as government and private health insurers seek to control healthcare costs by imposing lower payment rates and negotiating reduced contract rates with third-party payors. If sufficient reimbursement is not available for our current or future products, in either the United States or internationally, the demand for our products may be adversely affected or we may decide to cease commercial activities in any such region.\nWe are currently engaging in certain restructuring efforts which we may be unsuccessful in executing and, even if successful, may lead to undesirable outcomes.\nWe are currently restructuring certain aspects of our business and operations to reprioritize our sales and marketing efforts, rationalize our international presence and related expenses, streamline our workforce and take other measures to increase efficiencies, facilitate access to capital to fund operations as needed, decrease our cash consumption and decrease our cost to serve, while refocusing our business on strong execution of our core strategies. These restructuring plans reflect assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we consider appropriate under the circumstances. Whether our restructuring efforts will prove successful depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: (i) our ability to raise substantial additional capital on terms acceptable to us or at all, and to maintain adequate liquidity to satisfy our debt covenants and to allow us to execute our business plans, (ii) our ability to service or refinance our existing indebtedness and pay off such indebtedness as it comes due, (iii) our ability to maintain suppliers\u2019, hospitals\u2019, medical facilities\u2019 and practitioners\u2019 confidence in our products, (iv) our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for our new products and product iterations and to maintain our material product approvals, (v) our ability to efficiently reduce our operational expenditures, while retaining key employees and programs, and (vi) the overall success of our business. In addition, as long as these cost restructuring efforts continue, and for a substantial time afterwards, our employees may face considerable distraction and uncertainty and we may experience increased levels of employee attrition. The implementation of these restructuring efforts has occupied and will continue to occupy a substantial portion of the time and attention of our management and will impact our business, including revenue.\nWe may never realize the expected benefits of our business combination transactions.\nIn addition to developing new products and growing our business internally, we have sought to grow through combinations with complementary businesses. Examples include our merger with TriVascular in 2016 and our merger with Nellix in 2010. Such business combination transactions involve risks, including the risk that we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction. For example, the success of our business combination transactions largely depends on our ability to achieve anticipated regulatory approvals and growth opportunities for existing products and potential new products. Our ability to realize these benefits, and the timing of this realization, depend upon a number of factors and future events, many of which we cannot control. With respect to the acquired products and technologies, these factors and events include, without limitation, the results of clinical trials, the receipt and maintenance of applicable regulatory approvals, obtaining and maintaining intellectual property rights and further developing an effective sales and marketing organization in global markets. Although we carefully plan our business combination transactions, we may be unable to realize the expected benefits of such transactions.\nOur success depends on the growth in the number of AAA patients treated with endovascular devices and the general support for EVAR and EVAS technologies in the medical community.\nWe estimate that over 200,000 people a year are diagnosed with AAA in the United States, and that in 2018 approximately 63,000 people underwent aneurysm repair, either via EVAR or open surgical repair. Our growth will depend upon an increasing percentage of patients with AAA being diagnosed, and an increasing percentage of those diagnosed receiving EVAR, as opposed to undergoing open surgical repair. Initiatives to increase screening for AAA include SAAAVE, which was signed into law on February 8, 2006 in the United States. SAAAVE provides for one-time AAA screenings for men who have smoked at some time in their lives, and men or women who have a family history of the disease. Beginning January 1, 2007, screening has also been provided as part of the \u201cWelcome to Medicare\u201d physical. Such general screening programs may never gain wide acceptance. The failure to diagnose more patients with AAA could negatively impact our revenue growth.\nFurthermore, certain recent industry guidance in the EU has questioned the safety and effectiveness of EVAR and EVAS. In May 2018, the United Kingdom\u2019s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (\u201cNICE\u201d) issued draft guidance on AAA diagnosis and management that, among other things, states that patients should not be offered EVAR if open surgical repair is suitable. In November 2018, the European Society for Vascular Surgery (the \u201cESVS\u201d) presented its updated guidelines on the treatment of AAA which included a strong negative recommendation regarding the use of EVAS in clinical practice outside of studies approved by research ethics committees and only with informed consent from the patients, until adequately evaluated. These recommendations and guidelines may adversely affect the growth in the number of AAA patients that are treated with endovascular devices, and adversely affect the commercial availability and customer adoption of our EVAS products, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur success depends on convincing physicians to use, and continue to use, our products in more endovascular AAA procedures and to assist us in development of new products.\nIf we are unable to continue to educate physicians on the use of our products to drive use of our products and to use our products in more endovascular AAA procedures, our business could be negatively impacted. Further, we rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the research, development, marketing and sale of our products. Physicians assist us as researchers, marketing and product consultants, inventors, and public speakers. If we are unable to maintain our strong relationships with the professionals who use and support our products and continue to receive their advice and input, many of our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of such professionals, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated earnings, financial condition, and/or cash flows.\nManufacturing and quality problems with our products could harm our reputation and erode our competitive advantage, sales and market share.\nThe manufacture of many of our products is highly complex and subject to strict quality controls, due in part to rigorous regulatory requirements. In addition, quality is extremely important due to the serious and costly consequences of a product failure. Problems can arise during the manufacturing process for a number of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to maintain or follow necessary protocols and procedures, raw material problems or human error. If these problems arise or if we otherwise fail to meet our internal quality standards or those of the FDA or other applicable regulatory bodies, which include detailed record-keeping requirements, our reputation could be damaged, we could become subject to a safety alert or recall, we could incur product liability and other costs, product approvals could be delayed, suspended or revoked and our business could otherwise be adversely affected.\nIf we or our third party suppliers fail to comply with extensive FDA regulations relating to the manufacturing of our products or any component part, or otherwise encounter manufacturing problems, this could harm our reputation, we may be subject to fines, injunctions and penalties, and our ability to commercially distribute and sell our products may be harmed.\nOur manufacturing facilities and the manufacturing facilities of any of our third party component manufacturers, critical suppliers or third party sterilization facilities are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (\u201cQSR\u201d) which sets forth minimum standards for the procedures, execution and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of the products we sell.\nThe FDA may evaluate our compliance with the QSR, in a variety of ways, including through periodic announced or unannounced inspections, which could disrupt our operations and interrupt our manufacturing. If, in conducting an inspection of our manufacturing facilities or the manufacturing facilities of any of our third party component manufacturers, critical suppliers or third party sterilization facilities, FDA investigators observe conditions or practices that are believed to violate the QSR, the FDA may take administrative or enforcement actions, including a corporate warning letter, consent decree, product seizure, injunction and criminal prosecution, which could result in total or partial suspension of a facility\u2019s production and/or distribution activities, product recalls, fines, civil penalties, suspension of the FDA\u2019s review of product applications and the FDA\u2019s issuance of adverse publicity. Thus, an adverse inspection could force a shutdown of our manufacturing operations or a recall of our products. Adverse inspections could also delay or lead to revocation of FDA approval of our products and could have an adverse effect on our production, sales and profitability.\nWe and any of our third party suppliers may also encounter other problems during manufacturing including failure to maintain or follow specific protocols and procedures, equipment malfunction, component or raw materials shortages and environmental factors, any of which could delay or impede our ability to meet demand. The manufacture of our products also subjects us to risks that could harm our business, including problems relating to the sterilization of our products, errors in manufacturing processes and defects in components that could negatively affect the efficacy or safety of our products or cause delays in shipment of our products. Any interruption or delay in the manufacture of the product or any of its components could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to cancel orders or switch to competitive products and could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international operations involve operating risks, which could adversely impact our net sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nSales of our products outside of the United States represented approximately 30% of our revenue in 2018. In select countries in Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and other targeted international geographies, we market and sell our products through a network of third party distributors and agents. The sale and shipment of our products across international borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources, subject us to extensive United States and foreign governmental trade, import and export, and custom regulations and laws.\nPursuant to the SEC rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals in our products, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries, we are now required to disclose the procedures we employ to determine the sourcing of such minerals, and metals produced from those minerals. The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. Although we intend to disclose that we utilized certain of the four conflict minerals in our products in our conflict minerals report for the 2018 calendar year, we have been unable in all instances to determine that our sources of these minerals have been certified as \u201cconflict free.\u201d We may continue to face difficulties in gathering this information in the future.\nCompliance with these regulations is costly and exposes us to penalties for non-compliance. Other laws and regulations that can significantly impact us include various anti-bribery laws, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act 2010, import/export regulations and requirements such as those imposed by the U.S. Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control and U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security, and anti-boycott laws and similar laws in foreign jurisdictions. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, restrictions on certain business activities, and exclusion or debarment from government contracting. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our shipping and sales activities, including as the result of the loss of one or more of our product registrations in these foreign jurisdictions. We may determine not to renew one or more of our product registrations in foreign jurisdictions at this time given the meaningful costs of renewing such registrations, including opportunity costs of allocating necessary resources to these renewals, when measured against the potential market opportunities. We and our distributors are required to expend considerable resources to comply with the laws of foreign jurisdictions in which our products are sold. These legal, regulatory and other requirements, individually and in the aggregate, may impact our decisions regarding where to obtain or maintain our product registrations, and the determination not to obtain or maintain a product registration in a certain country or territory may have a negative impact on our relationship with our distributors.\nA significant portion of our sales outside of the United States are denominated in local currencies and not in United States dollars. Measured in local currency, a substantial portion of our international sales was generated in Europe (and primarily denominated in the Euro) and in Japan. The United States dollar value of our international sales varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations. Decreases in the value of the United States dollar relative to the Euro or the British Pound Sterling, as well as other currencies, have the effect of increasing our reported revenue even when the volume of international sales has remained constant. Increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to the Euro or the British Pound Sterling, as well as other currencies, have the opposite effect and, if significant, could have a material adverse effect on our reported revenue and results of operations.\nOur international operations expose us and our distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions.\nThe risks associated with international operations include the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\npricing pressure that we may experience internationally;\n\u2022\na shortage of high-quality sales people and distributors;\n\u2022\nchanges in third party reimbursement policies that may require some of the patients who receive our products to directly absorb medical costs or that may necessitate the reduction of the selling prices of our products;\n\u2022\nrulings, findings, reports, recommendations or guidance from governmental or industry entities that are adverse to our products or to EVAR/EVAS products and technologies generally;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of additional United States and foreign governmental controls or regulations;\n\u2022\npolitical, economic and social instability;\n\u2022\nchanges in duties and tariffs, license obligations and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives and distributors;\n\u2022\nscrutiny of foreign tax authorities which could result in significant fines, penalties and additional taxes being imposed on us;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining consistency with our internal guidelines;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of United States or international sanctions against a country, company, person or entity with whom we do business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country, company, person or entity; and\n\u2022\nthe imposition of new trade restrictions.\nIf we experience any of these risks, our sales in international countries may be harmed and our results of operations would suffer.\nWe depend on our officers and other skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business effectively. If we are not able to retain our current employees or recruit additional qualified personnel, our business will suffer and our future revenue and profitability will be impaired.\nWe are highly dependent on the skills and experience of our executive officers and key employees. We do not have any insurance in the event of the death or disability of our key personnel. In most cases, our officers and key employees may terminate their employment and work elsewhere without notice and without cause or good reason. Due to the specialized knowledge of each of our officers with respect to our products and operations, and the limited pool of people with relevant experience in the medical device field, the loss of service of one or more of these individuals could significantly affect our ability to operate and manage our business. The announcement of the loss of one or more of our key personnel could negatively affect our stock price. In particular, we believe that the skills and experience of Mr. Onopchenko, our Chief Executive Officer, are important to our success. The loss of Mr. Onopchenko\u2019s services could significantly affect our ability to operate and manage our business and could negatively affect our stock price.\nUnder Mr. Onopchenko\u2019s leadership, we determined to streamline and restructure certain of our operations and implement certain management changes. These plans resulted in significant changes in the composition of the senior management team. Our Vice Presidents of Regulatory, Clinical, Quality, Manufacturing, Research and Development, and U.S. Sales (as of the beginning of 2018) separated from us during 2018. In addition, our previous Chief Human Resources Officer retired in February 2019. The loss of these members of senior management, and any future attrition resulting from or arising during planned restructuring efforts (whether such attrition is expected or unexpected), could significantly impact our ability to operate and manage our business and could negatively impact our financial results. Further, pursuant to our restructuring plan, we have materially augmented our leadership team, including through the additions of a Chief Quality Officer, Chief Operations Officer and Vice President of Global Clinical and Regulatory Affairs during 2018, as well as a Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Commercial Officer in the first quarter of 2019, and also promoted certain existing employees to Vice President to lead certain functional departments. We anticipate that we may further augment our leadership team as we deem necessary or advisable. There is no assurance that the new members of our executive team (i) will be successful in implementing our restructuring efforts and executing our long-term strategies, or (ii) will remain with us over the longer-term.\nWe depend on our scientific and technical personnel for successful product development and innovation, which are critical to the success of our business. In addition, to succeed in the implementation of our business strategy, our management team must rapidly execute our sales strategy, obtain anticipated FDA clearances and approvals, achieve market acceptance of our products and further develop products, while addressing our strategic objectives through the implementation and enhancement of effective planning, manufacturing and operating processes. We compete for talented personnel against companies with more expansive product offerings and greater technical and financial resources. Successfully managing our business will require us to attract and retain talented and experienced management and technical personnel, but there is no guaranty that we will be able to hire or retain such personnel.\nIf we are unable to provide meaningful equity incentives to our key employees, it could adversely affect our ability to retain these key employees, which in turn could affect our ability to implement our business strategies.\nWe are highly dependent upon the members of our management team, as well as high-performing sales representatives and other key employees. Many of these individuals have been employed by us for many years, have played integral roles in the growth of our business, and will continue to provide value to us. In our industry, it is common to attract and retain executive talent and other employees with compensation packages that include a significant equity component. At this time, the vast majority of our outstanding equity awards, which are generally issued in the form of stock options, are significantly out-of-the-money, are unlikely to be exercised in the future, and as a result, provide little value to employees holding such awards. Further, despite the recent approval by our stockholders in December 2018 of an increase in the total number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the \u201c2015 Plan\u201d), we do not currently have sufficient available shares under the 2015 Plan to offer meaningful equity incentives to our existing employees, and we believe that we will be required to ask our stockholders to approve another increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2015 Plan in the near future. If our stockholders do not approve any proposal by us to increase the share reserve under the 2015 Plan as we deem necessary, we may be materially limited in our ability to offer equity incentives to our existing employees, which could meaningfully affect our ability to retain our key employees and to execute on our business strategies. Even if we do issue significant additional equity incentives, whether or not these incentives are subject to certain conditions precedent including the availability of sufficient shares for issuance under our 2015 Plan, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain key executive talent. A loss of any of our key personnel may have a material adverse effect on our ability to execute our business strategy.\nThe actions and omissions of our third party distributors may subject us to revenue, compliance and other risk.\nWe depend in part on medical device distributors and strategic relationships for the marketing and sale of our products outside of the United States and outside of certain countries in Europe. We depend on these distributors\u2019 efforts to market our products effectively and in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, yet we are unable to control their efforts completely. For instance, if our distributors fail to provide us or applicable governmental authorities with timely quality, regulatory or other required notifications, including with respect to adverse events or other matters potentially affecting patient safety, then we could incur risk, including the risk of non-compliance with applicable FDA regulations or the regulations of the foreign jurisdiction(s) in which the distributors sell our products, and our business could suffer. In addition, we are unable to ensure that our distributors comply with all applicable laws regarding the sale of our products, including marketing and promotion of our products in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If our distributors fail to effectively market and sell our products, or to do so in full compliance with applicable laws, our operating results and business may suffer.\nIf clinical trials of our current or future products do not produce the results necessary to support regulatory clearance or approval in the United States or elsewhere, we will be unable to commercialize these products.\nWe are currently conducting clinical trials. We will likely need to conduct additional clinical trials in the future to support new product approvals, for approval for new indications for the use of our products, or to support the use of existing products. Clinical testing is expensive, and typically takes many years, and carries uncertain outcomes. The initiation and completion of any of these studies may be prevented, delayed, or halted for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe FDA, institutional review boards or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical study protocol, force us to modify a previously-approved protocol, or place a clinical study on hold;\n\u2022\npatients do not enroll in, do not enroll at the rate we expect, or do not complete a clinical study;\n\u2022\npatients or investigators do not comply with study protocols;\n\u2022\npatients do not return for post-treatment follow-up at the rate we expect;\n\u2022\npatients experience serious or unexpected adverse side effects for a variety of reasons that may or may not be related to our products, such as the advanced stage of co-morbidities that may exist at the time of treatment, causing a clinical study to be put on hold or terminated;\n\u2022\nsites participating in an ongoing clinical study may withdraw, requiring us to engage new sites;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays associated with establishing additional clinical sites;\n\u2022\nthird party clinical investigators decline to participate in our clinical studies, do not perform the clinical studies on the anticipated schedule, or are inconsistent with the investigator agreement, clinical study protocol, good clinical practices, and other FDA and Institutional Review Board requirements;\n\u2022\nfailure to complete data collection analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u2022\nregulatory inspections of our clinical studies require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical studies;\n\u2022\nchanges in federal, state, or foreign governmental statutes, regulations or policies;\n\u2022\ninterim results are inconclusive or unfavorable as to immediate and long-term safety or efficacy of our products;\n\u2022\nthe study design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy of our products; or\n\u2022\nthe results of the study do not meet the study endpoints.\nClinical failure can occur at any stage of the testing. Our clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and/or non-clinical testing in addition to those we have planned. For example, in 2017, the FDA required us to undergo a confirmatory trial, called EVAS2, of our Nellix EVAS System because it deemed the results of our EVAS1 trial insufficient to support regulatory clearance. Our failure to adequately demonstrate the efficacy and safety of any of our devices would prevent receipt of regulatory clearance or approval and, ultimately, the commercialization of that device or indication for use.\nWe depend on a limited number of third party suppliers, including single sourced suppliers that supply several components for our product lines, and any disruption in the supply of such materials could impair our ability to manufacture our products or meet customer demand for our products in a timely and cost effective manner.\nWe currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third party suppliers to supply components of our current products and our potential future products. Our reliance on these third party suppliers, and especially our single source suppliers, exposes our operations to disruptions in supply, including disruptions caused by:\n\u2022\nfailure of our suppliers to comply with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ncontractual or other disputes with any such supplier;\n\u2022\nchange of ownership of a supplier through acquisition or sale of a business\n\u2022\nany strike or work stoppage;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in shipping;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing limitations or other restrictions on availability or use of raw materials or components necessary for the development, testing, manufacture or sale of our products;\n\u2022\na natural disaster caused by fire, flood or earthquakes; or\n\u2022\na supply shortage experienced by a single source supplier.\nFor our business strategy to be successful, our suppliers must be able to provide us with components in sufficient quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements and quality control standards, in accordance with agreed-upon specifications, at acceptable costs and on a timely basis.\nWe do not have long-term supply agreements with many of our suppliers and, in many cases, we make our purchases on a purchase order basis. As a result, our ability to purchase adequate quantities of our components or products may be limited. Additionally, our suppliers may encounter problems that limit their abilities to manufacture components or products for us, including financial difficulties, change in ownership or damage to their manufacturing equipment or facilities. If we fail to obtain sufficient quantities of high quality components to meet demand on a timely basis, we could lose customer orders, our reputation may be harmed and our business could suffer. Furthermore, negative perceptions among our suppliers regarding our financial stability, and our ability to sustain our business operations on a long-term basis, may cause one or more of our suppliers to terminate their relationships with us, or to claim that our financial condition causes them to demand different payment terms.\nDepending on a limited number of suppliers exposes us to risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality and delivery schedules. Moreover, in some cases, we do not have long-standing relationships with our suppliers and the limited size of our order quantities for certain components may not be sufficient to convince suppliers to continue to make components available to us unless there is demand for such components from their other customers. As a result, there is a risk that certain components could be discontinued and no longer available to us. We have in the past been, and we may in the future be, required to make significant \u201clast time\u201d purchases of component inventory that is being discontinued by the manufacturer to ensure supply continuity. If any one or more of our suppliers cease to provide us with sufficient quantities of components in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us, we would have to seek alternative sources of supply. Because of factors such as the proprietary nature of our products, our quality control standards and applicable regulatory requirements, we cannot quickly engage additional or replacement suppliers for some of our critical components. Failure of any of our suppliers to deliver products at the level our business requires would limit our ability to meet, or possibly prevent us from meeting, our sales commitments, which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may also have difficulty obtaining similar components from other suppliers that are acceptable to meet our own quality requirements, the FDA or other regulatory agencies, and the failure of our suppliers to comply with regulatory requirements could expose us to regulatory action including warning letters, product recalls, termination of distribution, product seizures or civil penalties. Such a failure by our suppliers could also require us to cease using the components, seek alternative components or technologies, and modify our products to incorporate alternative components or technologies, which could necessitate additional regulatory approvals. Any disruption of this nature, or any increased expenses associated with any such disruption, could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis, in sufficient quantities, or at all, which could harm our commercialization efforts and have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our business may be negatively affected.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technologies. We rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, and nondisclosure, confidentiality\nand other contractual restrictions, to protect our proprietary technology. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. Our pending United States and foreign patent applications may not issue as patents or may not issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. Any patents we have obtained, or will obtain, may be challenged by re-examination, inter partes review, opposition or other administrative proceeding, or in litigation. Such challenges could result in a determination that the patent is invalid. In addition, competitors may be able to design alternative methods or devices that avoid infringement of our patents. To the extent our intellectual property protection is inadequate, or is found to be invalid, we are exposed to a greater risk of direct competition. If our intellectual property does not provide adequate protection against our competitors\u2019 products, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business. Both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, if at all. In addition, changes in United States patent laws could prevent or limit us from filing patent applications or patent claims to protect our products and/or technologies or limit the exclusivity periods that are available to patent holders.\nWe also own trade secrets and confidential information that we try to protect by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and other parties. However, such agreements may not be honored or, if breached, we may not have sufficient remedies to protect our confidential information. Further, our competitors may independently learn our trade secrets or develop similar or superior technologies. To the extent that our employees, consultants or others apply technological information to our projects that they develop independently or others develop, disputes may arise regarding the ownership of proprietary rights to such information, and such disputes may not be resolved in our favor. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property adequately, our business and commercial prospects will likely suffer.\nThe medical device industry is subject to extensive patent litigation, and if our products or processes infringe upon the intellectual property of third parties, the sale of our products may be challenged and we may have to defend costly and time-consuming infringement claims.\nLike other medical device companies, we receive notices of alleged patent infringement from third parties in the ordinary course of our business. We are required to assess each of these claims and then determine appropriate disposition of each claim, which can take significant time, effort and financial resources. We are currently in the process of addressing a small number of these types of matters.\nWe may need to engage in expensive and prolonged litigation to assert or defend any of our intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of rights claimed by other parties. With no certainty as to the outcome, litigation could be too expensive for us to pursue. Our failure to pursue or prevail in such litigation could result in the loss of our rights, which could substantially hurt our business.\nIf we elect to settle an infringement claim, any such settlement could be on unfavorable financial or other terms that could affect our revenue, gross margins and other financial results.\nOur failure to assert our intellectual property rights, or the potential for intellectual property litigation, could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nstop selling, making, or using products that use the disputed intellectual property;\n\u2022\nobtain a license from the intellectual property owner to continue selling, making, licensing, or using products, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\nredesign our products, processes or services; or\n\u2022\nsubject us to significant liabilities to third parties.\nIf any of the foregoing occurs, we may be unable to manufacture and sell our products and may suffer severe financial harm. Whether or not an intellectual property claim is valid, the cost of responding to it, in terms of legal fees and expenses and the diversion of management resources, could harm our business.\nOn May 7, 2018, we received notice from Medtronic, Inc. (\u201cMedtronic\u201d) that Medtronic believes that our Ovation product appears to use one or more claims of certain Medtronic patents. We continue to assess this claim and we are engaged in discussions with Medtronic regarding their invitation to obtain a non-exclusive license to these patents. We have a robust patent portfolio at our disposal, and after conducting our analysis, we believe that one or more of Medtronic\u2019s products appears to use one or more claims of our patents. Since it is presently not possible to determine the outcome of any discussions with Medtronic in regard to the respective parties\u2019 patents, whether or not litigation will ensue, or the outcomes associated with potential litigation, no provision has been made in our financial statements for the ultimate resolution. It is possible that we could incur substantial costs associated with Medtronic\u2019s claims and any resolution with Medtronic may result in substantial damages, payment of royalties, result in or be connected to additional claims, and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, any of which could harm our business.\nWe may face product liability claims that could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities.\nThe manufacture, marketing and sale of our commercial products, and the clinical testing of our products under development, may expose us to significant risk of product liability claims. In the past, we have had a small number of product liability claims relating to our products, none of which either individually, or in the aggregate, have resulted in a material negative impact on our business. As the result of recent field safety notices and related regulatory communications involving our AFX and Ovation systems, as well as commercial withdrawal of our Nellix EVAS System and related regulatory communications, we may see an increase in product liability activity. Any additional product liability claims may have, individually or in the aggregate, a negative impact on our business. Such claims could divert our management from pursuing our business strategy and may be costly to defend. Regardless of the merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\ninjury to our relationships with our customers;\n\u2022\nsignificant litigation and other costs;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to or costly settlements with patients;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize new products or maintain existing product approvals.\nAlthough we have, and intend to maintain, product liability insurance, the coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to protect us from liabilities that we may incur, and one or more claims brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against losses. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our reputation and financial condition, strain our management and other resources and adversely affect or eliminate the prospects for commercialization or sales of a product which is the subject of such claim. In addition, a recall of our products, whether or not as a result of a product liability claim, could result in decreased demand for our products, injury to our reputation, significant litigation and other costs, substantial monetary awards to or costly settlements with patients, loss of revenue and our inability to commercialize new products or product candidates.\nWe are currently involved in litigation, and may face future claims, that could adversely affect our business and financial condition, divert management\u2019s attention from our business, and subject us to significant liabilities.\nOn January 3, 2017 and January 9, 2017, two stockholders purporting to represent a class of persons who purchased our securities between August 2, 2016 and November 16, 2016, filed lawsuits against us and certain of our officers in the United States District Court for the Central District of California (the \u201cDistrict Court\u201d). The lawsuits allege that we made materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about our business, operational and financial performance, in violation of federal securities laws, relating to FDA PMA for our Nellix EVAS System. On May 26, 2017, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint extending the class period to include persons who purchased our securities between May 5, 2016 and May 18, 2017 and adding certain factual assertions and allegations regarding the Nellix EVAS System. The plaintiffs sought unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the alleged class, interest, and attorney\u2019s fees and costs of litigation. The first lawsuit, Nguyen v. Endologix, Inc. et al., Case No. 2:17-cv-0017 AB (PLAx) (C.D. Cal.), was consolidated with the second lawsuit, Ahmed v. Endologix, Inc. et al, Case No. 8:17-cv-00061 AB (PLAx) (C.D. Cal.), and lead Nguyen plaintiff filed a consolidated First Amended Complaint. On December 5, 2017, the District Court granted our motion to dismiss lead plaintiff\u2019s First Amended Complaint, with leave to amend. On January 9, 2018, lead plaintiff filed a Second Amended Complaint, and on March 12, 2018, we filed our Motion to Dismiss this Second Amended Complaint with prejudice. On September 6, 2018, the District Court dismissed the Second Amended Complaint with prejudice. On October 5, 2018, lead plaintiff filed a notice of appeal, and on March 15, 2019, lead plaintiff filed its opening brief with the appellate court.\nAs of June 11, 2017, four stockholders have filed derivative lawsuits seeking unspecified monetary damages on behalf of Endologix, the nominal plaintiff, based on allegations substantially similar to those alleged by lead plaintiff in Nguyen. Those actions consist of: Sindlinger v. McDermott et al., Case No. BC662280 (Los Angeles Superior Court); Abraham v. McDermott et al., Case No. 30-2018-00968971-CU-BT-CSC (Orange County Superior Court); and Green v. McDermott et al., Case No. 8:17-cv-01155-AB (PLAx), which has been consolidated with Cocco v. McDermott et al., Case No. 8:17-cv-01183-AB (PLAx) (C.D. Cal.).\nAlthough we believe that these lawsuits are without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously, we are not able to predict the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits. It is possible that they could cause us to incur substantial costs and that they could be resolved adversely to us, result in substantial damages, result in or be connected to additional claims, and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, any of which could harm our business. While we maintain director and officer liability insurance, the amount of insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover these claims and other claims to which we may become subject, and the continued availability of this insurance cannot be assured. Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition and could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees.\nIf our facilities or systems are damaged or destroyed, we may experience delays that could negatively impact our revenue or have other adverse effects.\nOur facilities and systems may be affected by natural or man-made disasters. We currently conduct our manufacturing, development and management activities in Santa Rosa, California and Irvine, California, near known earthquake fault zones and seasonal wildfire activity. Our finished goods inventory is split between our Santa Rosa and Irvine locations, our distribution center in Tilburg, the Netherlands, and other forward stocking locations. We have taken precautions to safeguard our facilities and systems, including insurance, health and safety protocols, and off-site storage of computer data. However, our facilities and systems may be vulnerable to earthquakes, fire, storm, power loss, telecommunications failures, physical and software break-ins, software viruses and similar events which could cause substantial delays in our operations, damage or destroy our equipment or inventory, and cause us to incur additional expenses. In addition, the insurance coverage we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nFailure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyber-based attacks, network security breaches, service interruptions, or data corruption could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely on information technology and telephone networks and systems, including the Internet, to process and transmit sensitive electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including sales, billing, customer service, procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, and distribution. We use enterprise information technology systems to record, process, and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Our information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent breakdowns in our information technology and telephone systems, if our systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and we are unable to effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business and operating results may suffer. Further, if our information technology systems are compromised by third parties, we may be subject to fines, judgments, sanction or other penalties arising out of the compromising activities.\nWe are subject to credit risk from our accounts receivable related to our product sales, which include sales within countries that are currently experiencing economic turmoil.\nThe majority of our accounts receivable arise from product sales in the United States. However, we also have significant receivable balances from customers within the EU, Japan, Brazil and Singapore. Our accounts receivable in the United States are primarily due from public and private hospitals. Our accounts receivable outside of the United States are primarily due from public and private hospitals and independent distributors. Our historical write-offs of accounts receivable have not been significant.\nWe monitor the financial performance and credit worthiness of our customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile. Our independent distributors and sub-dealers operate in certain countries where economic conditions continue to present challenges to their businesses and, thus, could place the amounts that they owe to us at risk. These distributors are owed amounts from public hospitals that are funded by their governments. Adverse financial conditions in these countries may continue, negatively affecting the length of time that it will take us to collect associated accounts receivable or impact the likelihood of ultimate collection.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.\nThe healthcare industry has been consolidating, and organizations such as GPOs, independent delivery networks, and large single accounts continue to consolidate purchasing decisions for many of our healthcare provider customers. As a result, transactions with customers are larger, more complex, and tend to involve more long-term contracts. The purchasing power of these larger customers has increased, and may continue to increase, causing downward pressure on product pricing. If we are not one of the providers selected by one of these organizations, we may be precluded from making sales to its members or participants. Even if we are one of the selected providers, we may be at a disadvantage relative to other selected providers that are able to offer volume discounts based on purchases of a broader range of medical equipment and supplies. Further, we may be required to commit to pricing that has a material adverse effect on our revenue and profit margins, business, financial condition and results of operations. We expect that market demand, governmental regulation, third party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances, which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf any future acquisitions or business development efforts are unsuccessful, our business may be harmed.\nAs part of our business strategy to be an innovative leader in the treatment of aortic disorders, we may need to acquire other companies, technologies, and product lines in the future. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we will pay more than the value we derive from the acquisition, which could result in future non-cash impairment charges;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integration of the operations, technologies and products of the acquired companies, which may require significant attention of our management that otherwise would be available for the ongoing development of our business;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of certain known and unknown liabilities of the acquired companies; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in retaining key relationships with employees, customers, partners and suppliers of the acquired company.\nIn addition, we may invest in new technologies that may not succeed in the marketplace. If they are not successful, we may be unable to recover our initial investment, which could include the cost of acquiring the license, funding development efforts, acquiring products, or purchasing inventory. Any of these would negatively impact our future growth and cash reserves.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe have a history of operating losses and may be required to obtain additional funds to pursue our business strategy.\nWe have a history of operating losses and may need to seek additional capital in the future. We have entered into certain material agreements to consummate an equity financing and to restructure our unsecured convertible indebtedness and secured term loan indebtedness. If we consummate these transactions, we believe that our existing liquidity will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. If we are unable to consummate these transactions, we will need to find near-term alternative sources of capital and debt relief to continue to fund our operations. Even if we complete the equity financing and debt restructuring, we may need to obtain additional financing to pursue our business strategy, to respond to new competitive pressures or to act on opportunities to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, products or technologies. Our cash requirements in the future may be significantly different from our current estimates and depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe results of our commercialization efforts for our existing and future products;\n\u2022\nthe revenue generated by sales of our existing and future products;\n\u2022\nthe need for additional capital to fund existing and future development programs;\n\u2022\nthe need to adapt to changing technologies and technical requirements, and the costs related thereto;\n\u2022\nthe costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents or any litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property;\n\u2022\nthe establishment of high-volume manufacturing and increased sales and marketing capabilities; and\n\u2022\nwhether we are successful if we enter into collaborative relationships with other parties.\nIn addition, we are required to make periodic interest payments to the holders of our senior convertible notes and our senior secured lender under our term loan, and to make payments of principal upon conversion or maturity. Further, under our term loan, we are required to pay certain termination and related fees upon termination of such loan. We may also be required to purchase our senior convertible notes from the holders thereof upon the occurrence of a fundamental change involving our company, or to refinance our senior convertible notes prior to their maturity dates. To finance the foregoing, we may seek funds through borrowings or through additional rounds of financing, including private or public equity or debt offerings and collaborative arrangements with corporate partners. We may be unable to raise funds on favorable terms, or at all.\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. If we borrow additional funds or issue debt securities, these securities could have rights superior to holders of our common stock and could contain covenants that will restrict our operations. We might have to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies, product candidates, or products that we otherwise would not relinquish. If we do not obtain additional resources, our ability to capitalize on business opportunities will be limited, and the growth of our business will be harmed.\nChanges in the credit environment and covenant restrictions under our financing arrangements may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nFuture volatility in the global financial markets could increase borrowing costs or affect our ability to access the capital markets. Further, our ability to enter into or maintain existing financing arrangements on acceptable terms, including our amended and restated facility agreement and credit agreement, dated August 9, 2018, with affiliates of Deerfield Management Company, L.P. (\u201cDeerfield\u201d), as amended (the \u201cAmended Facility Agreement\u201d and the \u201cCredit Agreement,\u201d respectively; collectively the \u201cDeerfield Agreements\u201d), in respect of our $160.5 million term loan facility and $50.0 million revolving loan facility, respectively, could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products or the prices that we can command for our products, our customers become insolvent or decide to reduce or discontinue their purchase of our products, we encounter significant regulatory, quality, manufacturing or compliance issues, or any other material adverse event occurs that impacts our business. Any deterioration in our revenue, key financial ratios, or non-compliance with certain financial, reporting, regulatory, operational or other covenants or terms in existing or future loan or credit agreements, including the Deerfield Agreements, may result in an event of default under such agreements, which also could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe occurrence of an event of default under our Deerfield Agreements could result in an increase to the applicable interest rate, an acceleration of all obligations, an inability to access the revolving loan facility under the Credit Agreement, a requirement to repay all obligations in full and a right by Deerfield to exercise all remedies available to them. If we are unable to pay those amounts, Deerfield could proceed against the collateral granted to it pursuant to the Deerfield Agreements and we may in turn lose access to any sources of borrowing availability we may have. Any declaration of an event of default by Deerfield could also trigger an event of default under our outstanding convertible senior notes requiring the repayment of principal and interest outstanding under such notes. Further, if we are unable to repay our indebtedness and Deerfield institutes foreclosure proceedings against our assets, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation and equity holders may lose the entire value of their investment. In any such bankruptcy or liquidation scenario, the value that we receive for our assets could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, to pay any cash due upon conversion of or to refinance our indebtedness, including the senior convertible notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We have entered into certain material agreements to restructure our current indebtedness, including our 3.25% Senior Convertible Notes, due 2020, and our $160.5 million term loan under our Amended Facility Agreement. We may not successfully consummate this restructuring, or be successful in future negotiation pertaining to our indebtedness, so as to ensure our compliance with and satisfaction of our debt obligations. If we are unable to engage in any of these activities regarding our indebtedness, or engage in these activities on desirable terms, it could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nWe have limited resources to invest in research and development and to grow our business and may need to raise additional funds in the future for these activities.\nWe believe that our growth will depend, in significant part, on our ability to develop new technologies for the treatment of AAA and technology complementary to our current products. Our existing resources may not allow us to conduct all of the research and development activities that we believe would be beneficial for our future growth. As a result, we may need to seek funds in the future to finance these activities. If we are unable to raise funds on favorable terms, or at all, we may not be able to increase our research and development activities and the growth of our business may be negatively impacted.\nThe expense and potential unavailability of insurance coverage for our company may have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWhile we currently have insurance for our business, property, directors and officers, and product liability, such insurance coverage is increasingly costly and the scope of coverage is narrower, and we may be required to assume more risk in the future. If we are subject to claims or suffer a loss or damage in excess of our insurance coverage, we will be required to cover the amounts outside of or in excess of our insurance limits. If we are subject to claims or suffer a loss or damage that is outside of our insurance coverage, we may incur significant costs associated with loss or damage that could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Furthermore, any claims made on our insurance policies may impact our ability to obtain or maintain insurance coverage at reasonable costs or at all. We do not have the financial resources to self-insure, and it is unlikely that we will have these financial resources in the foreseeable future. Our product liability insurance covers our products and business operations, but we may need to increase and expand this coverage commensurate with our expanding business.\nRisks Related to Regulation of Our Industry\nHealthcare policy changes, including recent federal legislation to reform the United States healthcare system, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn response to perceived increases in healthcare costs in recent years, there have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third party payors to control these costs and, more generally, to reform the United States healthcare system. Certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. Moreover, as discussed below, recent federal legislation would impose significant new taxes on medical device makers such as us. The adoption of some or all of these proposals, including the recent federal legislation, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOn March 23, 2010, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (the \u201cPPACA\u201d). The total cost imposed on the medical device industry by the PPACA may be up to approximately $20 billion over ten years. The PPACA includes, among other things, a deductible 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited exceptions, effective January 1, 2013. This excise tax will result in a significant increase in the tax burden on our industry, and if any efforts we undertake to offset the excise tax are unsuccessful, the increased tax burden could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Other elements of the PPACA, including comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, payment system reforms including shared savings pilots and other provisions, may significantly affect the payment for, and the availability of, healthcare services and result in fundamental changes to federal healthcare reimbursement programs, any of which may materially affect numerous aspects of our business.\nOn December 18, 2015, President Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, which imposed a two-year moratorium on the 2.3% excise tax beginning on January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2017. On January 22, 2018, the continuing resolution extended this moratorium for an additional two years, through the 2019 calendar year. The continuing resolution provides that this additional delay applies to sales made after December 31, 2018. Therefore, as a result of both moratoriums, the medical devices tax will not apply to any sales made between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2019. While there was legislative activity in late December 2018 that proposed an additional 5-year moratorium on the excise tax, the expiration date of the current moratorium remains unchanged, expiring December 31, 2019.\nUpon the end of this period we believe the PPACA could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur future success depends on our ability to develop, receive regulatory clearance or approval for, and introduce new products or product enhancements that will be accepted by the market in a timely manner.\nIt is important to our business that we continue to build a more extensive product offering for treatment of AAA. Our success will depend in part on our ability to develop and introduce new products. However, we may not be able to successfully develop and obtain regulatory clearance or approval for product enhancements, or new products, or these products may not be accepted by physicians or the payors who financially support many of the procedures performed with our products. Recent industry guidance from NICE and the ESVS raises concerns regarding the regulatory and commercial prospects for EVAR and EVAS products in Europe. In the United States, the FDA\u2019s requirement that we complete the EVAS2 confirmatory trial has delayed the commercial introduction of the Nellix EVAS System in the United States. In the future we may face additional, similar regulatory constraints.\nIn addition to conforming with an evolving regulatory landscape, the success of any new product offering or enhancement to an existing product will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nproperly identify and anticipate physicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 needs;\n\u2022\ndevelop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u2022\navoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties;\n\u2022\ndemonstrate, if required, the safety and efficacy of new products with data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nobtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for new products or product enhancements;\n\u2022\nbe fully FDA-compliant with marketing of new devices or modified products;\n\u2022\nprovide adequate training to potential users of our products;\n\u2022\nreceive adequate coverage and reimbursement for procedures performed with our products; and\n\u2022\ndevelop an effective and regulatory-compliant, dedicated marketing and distribution network.\nIf we do not develop new products or product enhancements in time to meet market demand or if there is insufficient demand for these products or enhancements, our results of operations will suffer.\nOur business is subject to extensive governmental regulation that makes it expensive and time consuming for us to introduce new or improved products.\nOur products must comply with complex regulatory requirements imposed by the FDA and corresponding state agencies in the United States and similar agencies in foreign jurisdictions. These requirements involve lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures, sampling activities, extensive agency review processes, and other costly and time-consuming procedures. It often takes a number of years to satisfy these requirements, depending on the complexity and novelty of the product. We also are subject to numerous additional licensing and regulatory requirements relating to safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. Some of the most important requirements we face include:\n\u2022\nFDA Regulations (Title 21 CFR);\n\u2022\nEU CE Mark requirements, including the new Medical Device Regulations and MEDDEV 2.7.1 Rev.4, which implement stricter requirements for clinical data to support new product approvals;\n\u2022\nOther international regulatory approval requirements;\n\u2022\nMedical Device Single Audit Program (\u201cMDSAP\u201d);\n\u2022\nMedical Device Quality Management System Requirements (21 CFR 820, ISO 13485:2003, EN ISO 13485:2012, ISO 13485:2016, and other similar international regulations);\n\u2022\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration requirements; and\n\u2022\nCalifornia Department of Health Services requirements.\nGovernment regulation may impede our ability to conduct continuing clinical trials and to manufacture our existing and future products. Government regulation also could delay our marketing of new products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on our activities. The FDA and other regulatory agencies may not approve any of our future products on a timely basis, if at all. Any delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain, such approvals could negatively impact our marketing of any proposed products and reduce our product revenue.\nOur products remain subject to strict regulatory controls on manufacturing, marketing and use. We may be forced to modify or recall our product after release in response to regulatory action or unanticipated difficulties encountered in general use. Any such action could have a material effect on the reputation of our products and on our business and financial position.\nFurther, regulations may change, and any additional regulation could limit, delay or restrict our ability to market our products, which could harm our business. We could also be subject to new international, federal, state or local regulations that could affect our research and development programs and harm our business in unforeseen ways. If this happens, we may have to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations, which will harm our results of operations.\nThe potential off-label promotion and subsequent off-label use of our products may harm our reputation in the marketplace and result in government investigations and/or penalties.\nThe products we market have been cleared or approved by the FDA and international regulatory authorities for specific indications for use, including in specific AAA anatomies. Physicians have the discretion, however, to use our products outside of those cleared/approved indications for use, a practice known as \u201coff-label\u201d use. Off-label use of our and our competitors\u2019 products by physicians is common in the AAA field. We receive substantial revenue from the sale of our products for use by physicians in cases outside of the cleared/approved indications for use. Though physicians in most countries, including the United States, have the discretion to engage in off-label use of our products, FDA laws and regulations prohibit us from promoting our products for an unapproved use.\nOur internal policies and procedures are designed to achieve compliance with these and other applicable requirements, but FDA or other regulatory authorities could determine that our sales, marketing and educational activities, when evaluated in connection with the use of our products in off-label procedures, have constituted or may constitute the unlawful promotion of our products for unapproved use. We specifically have a compliance mechanism in place to investigate and address instances of noncompliance with company policies and procedures, with confirmed violations resulting in disciplinary action up to and including termination. If we are deemed by the FDA or other regulatory bodies to have engaged in the promotion of our products for off-label use, we could be subject to prohibitions on the sale or marketing of our products in the United States or other jurisdictions, face significant fines and penalties, and be required to enter into onerous corporate integrity agreements, consent decrees or similar court or agency-imposed agreements. The imposition of any such fines, penalties or sanctions could affect our reputation and position within the industry and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the use of our products for indications other than those cleared/approved by the FDA or international regulatory authorities may result in suboptimal outcomes that could harm our reputation in the marketplace among physicians and patients and lead to product liability claims.\nPhysicians may misuse our products or use improper techniques if they are not adequately trained, potentially leading to injury and an increased risk of product liability and similar claims. If our products are misused or used with improper technique, we may become subject to costly litigation by our customers or their patients. Product liability claims could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend, and result in sizable damage awards against us that may not be covered by insurance.\nOur products may be subject from time to time to product recalls or voluntary market withdrawals that could harm our reputation, business and financial results.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture that could affect patient safety. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found or suspected. A government-mandated recall or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other issues. We have engaged in product recalls from time to time, including a voluntary Class II recall of our AFX products with Strata graft material and certain larger sizes of our AFX2 product in late 2016 and early 2017, which recall (i) resulted in expenditure of resources and diversion of management time and attention and (ii) was negatively received in the marketplace. In addition, in October 2018, FDA classified a July 2018 safety notice that we issued to users of the AFX Endovascular AAA System as a Class I recall. We may elect to engage, or be required by FDA to engage, in additional recalls in the future. Any future recalls, which include corrections as well as removals, of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, harm our reputation with customers, and reduce our ability to achieve expected revenue.\nWe are required to comply with medical device reporting (\u201cMDR\u201d) requirements and must report certain malfunctions, deaths, and serious injuries associated with our products to regulatory agencies, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA MDR regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to submit information to the FDA when they receive a report or become aware that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has or may have a malfunction that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. All manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the European Economic Area are legally bound to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices they produce or sell to the regulatory agency (\u201cCompetent Authority\u201d), in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred. Material noncompliance with these reporting requirements may subject us to adverse regulatory action, including but not limited to receipt of a Warning Letter from FDA and enforcement action by the relevant Competent Authority.\nMalfunction of our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, including recalls, corrections, or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement actions. If malfunctions do occur, we may be unable to correct the malfunctions adequately or prevent further malfunctions, in which case we may need to cease manufacture and distribution of the affected products. Regulatory authorities may also take actions against us, such as ordering recalls, imposing fines, or seizing the affected products. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare fraud and abuse, transparency and other laws and regulations governing financial dealings with customers, physicians and payors, and a finding of failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations may be directly or indirectly affected by various broad federal, state or foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in return for or to induce the referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing or arranging for or recommending the ordering, purchasing or leasing of an item or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We are also subject to the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters, and federal \u201csunshine\u201d laws that require transparency regarding financial arrangements with healthcare providers, such as the reporting and disclosure requirements imposed by PPACA regarding any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers.\nIn addition, the federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing, or causing to be filed, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.\nMany states have also adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor, including commercial insurers as well as laws that restrict our marketing activities with physicians, and require us to report consulting and other payments to physicians. Some states mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws. We also are subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws, which vary by country. For instance, in the EU, legislation on inducements offered to physicians and other healthcare workers or hospitals differ from country to country. Breach of the laws relating to such inducements may expose us to the imposition of criminal sanctions.\nThe risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Moreover, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. Further, there may be additional federal and state laws and/or regulations, proposed and implemented, that could impact our operations and business. The extent to which future legislation or regulations, if any, relating to healthcare fraud abuse laws and/or enforcement, may be enacted or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business remains uncertain. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us now or in the future, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from governmental healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nWe may be subject to health information privacy and security laws and regulations, and a finding of failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe HIPAA statute, and its implementing regulations, safeguard the privacy and security of individually-identifiable health information. Certain of our operations may be subject to these requirements. Penalties for noncompliance with these rules include both criminal and civil penalties. In addition, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH Act\u201d) expanded federal health information privacy and security protections. Among other things, HITECH makes certain of HIPAA\u2019s privacy and security standards directly applicable to \u201cbusiness associates,\u201d such as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also set forth new notification requirements for health data security breaches, increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney\u2019s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many states have adopted data privacy and protection legislation offering similar or expanded protections to consumers and imposing security, reporting and notification requirements which are in some instances more stringent than those imposed by HIPAA or HITECH.\nThe global legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business, result in liability or impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. For example, the EU has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), which introduces strict requirements for processing personal data. The GDPR has imposed additional compliance obligations on us, including by mandating additional documentation requirements and granting certain rights to individuals to control how we collect, use, disclose, retain and leverage information about them. The processing of sensitive personal data, such as physical health condition, may impose heightened compliance burdens under the GDPR and is a topic of active interest among foreign regulators. In addition, the GDPR provides for breach reporting requirements, more robust regulatory enforcement and fines of up to \u20ac20 million or up to 4% of the annual global revenue. While companies are afforded some flexibility in determining how to comply with the GDPR\u2019s various requirements, it has and will continue to require significant effort and expense to ensure continuing compliance with the GDPR. Moreover, the requirements under the GDPR may change periodically or may be modified by EU national law and could have an effect on our business operations if compliance becomes substantially costlier than under current requirements.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe have certain contractual obligations pursuant to which we may be obligated to issue a significant number of additional shares of our common stock, which would result in a substantial amount of dilution to our existing stockholders.\nUnder the terms of our Amended Facility Agreement, we have issued warrants to Deerfield to purchase up to 1,522,002 shares of our common stock. In addition, (i) we have the right to issue Deerfield up to approximately 253,000 shares of our common stock in lieu of making certain interest payments under the Amended Facility Agreement, and (ii) Deerfield has the right to convert a portion of the indebtedness outstanding under the Amended Facility Agreement into a maximum of approximately 1.43 million shares of our common stock.\nFurther, if we consummate any equity financing or debt restructuring transactions, we anticipate that we will incur substantial additional dilution, including dilution resulting from:\n\u2022\nissuance of shares of our common stock (or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock) to investors in an equity offering;\n\u2022\nissuance of equity or equity-linked securities to our lenders in connection with any debt restructuring;\n\u2022\npotential conversion of existing indebtedness held by our lenders into common stock pursuant to agreed-upon conversion formulas.\nAny dilution incurred as a result of completion in the near-term of an equity financing or debt restructuring could result in issuance of common stock representing a substantial percentage of the number of shares currently outstanding. In addition, any debt restructuring involving our $160.5 million term loan under our Amended Facility Agreement and the holders of our 3.25% Senior Convertible Notes, due 2020, could result in potential conversion of certain portions of our outstanding indebtedness into common stock, and could also result in issuance to these lenders of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, which actual or potential issuances could result in very material additional dilution.\nIn addition, under the terms of our merger agreement with Nellix, we agreed to issue additional shares of our common stock to the former stockholders of Nellix as contingent consideration upon our satisfaction of certain milestones related to the Nellix EVAS System, or upon a change of control of our company. In June 2014, we issued 270,000 shares of our common stock upon achievement of a revenue-based milestone. In the event the remaining regulatory-based milestone is achieved, we may be obligated to issue up to approximately 330,000 additional shares of our common stock.\nThese potential issuances of additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock, would result in the immediate dilution of the ownership interests of holders of our common stock on the dates of such issuances.\nThe effective increase in the authorized number of shares of our common stock as a result of our reverse stock split could result in further dilution to our existing stockholders and have anti-takeover implications.\nIn connection with our reverse stock split, which was effective as of March 5, 2019, we conducted a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, but maintained the total number of authorized shares of our common stock. The combination of the reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares, and maintaining the number of our authorized shares, had the effect of significantly increasing our authorized shares relative to our issued and outstanding shares. This effective increase in the number of authorized shares will allow us to issue additional shares of our common stock (or securities convertible into, or exercisable or exchangeable for, our common stock), which would result in further dilution of our current stockholders.\nIn addition, the effective increase in the number of authorized shares could, under certain circumstances, have anti-takeover implications. For example, the additional shares of common stock that would become available for issuance could be used by us to oppose a hostile takeover attempt or to delay or prevent changes in control or our management. Although our reverse stock split proposal was prompted by business and financial considerations and not by the threat of any hostile takeover attempt, stockholders should be aware that the approval of the reverse stock split proposal could facilitate future efforts by us to deter or prevent changes in control, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices.\nThe price of our common stock has declined significantly and may continue to fluctuate in future periods.\nThe trading price of our common stock has declined significantly in the past 12 months. We believe our stock price has been, and will continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial and operating results from period to period;\n\u2022\nour actual or perceived need for additional capital to fund our operations, and perceptions about the potential dilutive impact of future financing or restructuring transactions;\n\u2022\nperceptions regarding the intentions of Deerfield with respect to the exercise of its warrants;\n\u2022\nperceptions about our financial stability generally, and relative to our competitors, including our ability to sustain our business operations, execute on our strategic plans and achieve profitability;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our products;\n\u2022\nintroduction of proposed products, technologies or treatment techniques by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant contracts, acquisitions or divestitures by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nregulatory approval of our products or the products of our competitors, the loss of regulatory approvals or clearances, or the failure to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances in a timely manner or at all;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls involving our products or the products of our competitors;\n\u2022\nperceptions regarding the effectiveness of our product quality systems;\n\u2022\nspeculative trading practices of market participants;\n\u2022\nissuance of securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our operating results to meet expectations of securities analysts and investors, or to be consistent with our financial guidance;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation, government investigations or enforcement actions; and\n\u2022\nchanges in healthcare laws or policies in the United States or other countries in which we conduct business; and\n\u2022\ngeneral political or economic conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance.\nThese and other factors might cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially and to decline even further. Fluctuations in our stock price may negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock, which could further adversely impact our stock price.\nIn recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies across many industries. These changes may occur without regard to the financial condition or operating performance of the affected companies. Accordingly, the price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company, and these fluctuations could materially reduce the market price of our common stock.\nTrading in our stock over the past 12 months has been limited, which may increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock.\nThe average daily trading volume in our common stock in the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately 74,000 shares. If limited trading in our stock continues, it may be difficult for investors to sell their shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices. Moreover, the market price for shares of our common stock may be more volatile because of the relatively low volume of trading in our common stock. When trading volume is low, significant price movement can be caused by the trading of a relatively small number of shares. Volatility in our common stock may result in further downward pressure on the market price of our common stock.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.\nThere has been and may continue to be meaningful variability in our operating results from quarter to quarter, as well as within each quarter, especially around the time of anticipated new product launches or regulatory approvals by us or our competitors. Our operating results, and the variability of these operating results, will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to increase sales from our current products, and to commercialize and sell our future products;\n\u2022\nintroduction of proposed products, technologies or treatment techniques by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe number and mix of our products sold in each quarter;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or in the pricing policies of our competitors or suppliers;\n\u2022\nchanges in third party payors\u2019 reimbursement policies;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain and motivate our sales force;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture products that meet quality and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical research and trials on our existing and future products;\n\u2022\nthe timing and expense associated with obtaining regulatory approval of our products;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls involving our products or the products of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing of revenue and expense recognition associated with our product sales pursuant to applicable accounting standards.\nBecause of these and possibly other factors, it is possible that in future periods our operating results will not meet investor expectations or those of securities analysts.\nIn addition, we expect our operating expenses will continue to increase as we execute our strategy and expand our business, which may exacerbate the quarterly fluctuations in our operating results. If our quarterly or annual operating results fall below the expectation of securities analysts or other market participants, or below the results expressed or implied by our financial guidance, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Further, any quarterly or annual fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially, and these price fluctuations could result in further pressure on our stock price. We believe quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nAny unanticipated change in revenue or other operating results is likely to cause our stock price to fluctuate since such changes reflect new information available to investors and analysts. New information may cause investors and analysts to revalue our business, which could cause a decline in the trading price of our stock.\nWe may not achieve the projections set forth in our financial guidance, or certain other anticipated goals and objectives that we announce publicly from time to time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and cause the market price of our shares to decline.\nWe typically provide financial guidance based on management\u2019s then current expectations, which is subject to the risks and uncertainties inherent in all financial forecasting. The failure to achieve our financial guidance, or the projections of securities analysts or other market participants, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, and disappoint analysts and investors, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nIn addition, we regularly make public announcements relating to our expected achievement of certain goals and objectives regarding our business, such as the timing of commercialization of new products, clinical trials, and regulatory approvals. The actual timing of these events can vary significantly due to a number of factors, including the various risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report. As a result, we may be unable to achieve our projected goals and objectives in the time periods that we anticipate or at all. The failure to achieve such projected goals and objectives in the time periods that we anticipate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could reduce our stock price and prevent our stockholders from replacing or removing our current management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of preferred stock with powers, preferences and rights that may be senior to our common stock, which can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nprovide for the adoption of a staggered board of directors whereby the board is divided into three classes each of which has a different three-year term;\n\u2022\nprovide that the number of directors shall be fixed by the board of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibit our stockholders from filling board vacancies;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from calling special stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nrequire advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur board of directors is authorized to issue and designate shares of our preferred stock in additional series without stockholder approval.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors, without the approval of our stockholders, to issue shares of our preferred stock, subject to limitations prescribed by applicable law, rules and regulations and the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as shares of preferred stock in series, and to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. The powers, preferences and rights of these additional series of preferred stock may be senior to or on parity with our common stock, and the issuance of such shares in the future may reduce the value of our common stock.\nWe may be at increased risk of securities class action litigation.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the price of a company\u2019s securities. We believe this risk may be particularly relevant to us as we have experienced a significant stock price decline in the past 12 months and may experience significant stock price volatility in the future. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, is designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the testing by our independent registered public accounting firm conducted in connection with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation. In addition, deficiencies in our internal controls could result in enforcement actions by the SEC or other regulatory bodies, which could cause us to incur defense costs and pay penalties or other costs. Furthermore, deficiencies in our internal controls may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Our current policy is to retain all funds and any earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. Our revolving credit facility and term loan contain restrictions prohibiting us from paying any cash dividends without the lender\u2019s prior approval. Accordingly, investors may have to sell some or all of their shares of our common stock in order to generate cash flow from their investment.\nUnited States federal income tax reform could adversely affect us and our stockholders.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d), which significantly reforms the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The TCJA, among other things, includes changes to United States federal tax rates, imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, allows for the expensing of capital expenditures, and puts into effect the migration from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation to a territorial system. We do not expect tax reform to have a material impact on our projection of minimal cash taxes. Our net deferred tax assets and liabilities were revalued at the newly-enacted U.S. corporate rate, and the impact was recognized in our tax expense, offset by a full valuation allowance, in the year of enactment. We continue to examine the impact that this tax reform legislation may have on our business. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is uncertain and could be adverse.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.\nThe SEC adopted a rule requiring disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The rule requires companies to perform due diligence, disclose and annually report to the SEC whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. The rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, which could increase our expenses. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, if our operating results fail to meet the forecasts of analysts or other market participants, our stock price would likely decline. In addition, if one or more analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline. We believe we are currently at greater risk that analysts may cease coverage of our company due to the recent decline in our stock price and market capitalization.", "PERMNO": 83633, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "ELGXQ"}
