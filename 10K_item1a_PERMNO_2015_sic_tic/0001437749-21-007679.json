{"cik": "861459", "company": "GRANITE CONSTRUCTION INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are various risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INVESTIGATION, RESTATEMENT AND MATERIAL WEAKNESSES\n\u2022\nWe restated our consolidated financial statements for several prior periods and failed to timely file our Annual and Quarterly Reports with the SEC, which has affected and may continue to affect investor confidence, our stock price, our ability to raise capital in the future, and our reputation with our customers, which may result in additional stockholder litigation and may reduce customer confidence in our ability to complete new contract opportunities. As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, we restated our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and unaudited quarterly financial information for the first three quarters of the year ended December 31, 2019 and for each of the quarters in the year ended December 31, 2018 to correct misstatements associated with project forecasts in the Heavy Civil operating group discovered in connection with the independent investigation (the \u201cInvestigation\u201d) of the Audit/Compliance Committee (the \u201cAudit Committee\u201d) of our Board of Directors. As a result of the Investigation and restatement process, we failed to timely file our Annual and Quarterly Reports with the SEC. Such restatement and failure to timely file our Annual and Quarterly Reports with the SEC:\n\u2022\nhas had and may continue to have the effect of eroding investor confidence in us and our financial reporting and accounting practices and processes;\n\u2022\nhas negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the trading price of our common stock;\n\u2022\nmay result in additional stockholder litigation;\n\u2022\nmay make it more difficult, expensive and time consuming for us to raise capital, if necessary, on acceptable terms, if at all, pursue transactions or implement business strategies that might otherwise be beneficial to our business;\n\u2022\nmay negatively impact our reputation with our customers;\n\u2022\nhas limited and may continue to limit our ability to bid for new projects; and\n\u2022\nmay cause customers to place new orders with other companies.\n\u2022\nThe Investigation, the restatement process, the completion of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the remediation process have diverted, and will continue to divert, management and other human resources from the operation of our business. The absence of timely and accurate financial information has hindered and may in the future hinder our ability to effectively manage our business. The Investigation, the restatement process, the completion of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the remediation process have diverted, and will continue to divert, management and other human resources from the operation of our business. The Board of Directors, members of management, and our accounting, legal, administrative and other staff have spent significant time on the Investigation, the restatement process, the completion of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the remediation process and will continue to spend significant time on remediation of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over our financial reporting. These resources have been, and will likely continue to be, diverted from the strategic and day-to-day management of our business and may have an adverse effect on our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives.\n\u2022\nWe identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, adversely impact the reliability of our financial statements, cause us to submit our financial statements in an untimely fashion, result in material misstatements in our financial statements and cause current and potential stockholders to lose confidence in our financial reporting, which in turn could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We have concluded that the material weaknesses initially identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 still exist. For additional information on the material weaknesses identified and our remedial efforts, see \u201cItem 9A, Controls and Procedures.\u201d These material weaknesses initially identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in the restatement of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and unaudited quarterly financial information for the first three quarters of the year ended December 31, 2019 and for each of the quarters in the year ended December 31, 2018 to correct misstatements associated with project forecasts in the Heavy Civil operating group. Because the material weaknesses still exist as of December 31, 2020, management has determined that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2020. Under Public Company Accounting Oversight Board standards, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a misstatement of our consolidated annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The existence of this issue could adversely affect us, our reputation or investor perceptions of us. We have and will continue to take additional measures to remediate the underlying causes of the material weaknesses noted above. As we continue to evaluate and work to remediate the material weaknesses, we may determine to take additional measures to address the control deficiencies.\nAlthough we plan to complete this remediation process as quickly as possible, we cannot at this time estimate how long it will take, and our measures may not prove to be successful in remediating these material weaknesses. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results. In addition, if we are unable to successfully remediate these material weaknesses and if we are unable to produce accurate and timely consolidated financial statements, our stock price, liquidity and access to the capital markets may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with applicable stock exchange listing requirements and debt covenant requirements. Further, because of its inherent limitations, even our remediated and effective internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in our conditions, or that the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\u2022\nWe are involved in, and may in the future be subject to, litigation and regulatory examinations, investigations, proceedings or orders as a result of or relating to our restatement and our failure to timely file our Annual and Quarterly Reports with the SEC and if any of these are resolved adversely against us, it could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are currently the subject of securities class action litigation. Additionally, in connection with our disclosure of the Audit Committee\u2019s independent Investigation, we voluntarily contacted the San Francisco office of the SEC Division of Enforcement regarding that Investigation. Since contacting the SEC, we have produced documents to the SEC regarding the accounting issues identified during the independent Investigation and will continue to cooperate with the SEC in its investigation. The SEC\u2019s investigation is ongoing and was not resolved when the Audit Committee completed the Investigation or when the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 was filed. The restatement and our failure to timely file our Annual and Quarterly Reports with the SEC, as well as our reported material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, may subject us to additional litigation and regulatory examinations, investigations, proceedings or orders, including a cease and desist order, the suspension of trading of our securities, delisting of our securities, the assessment of civil monetary penalties, and other equitable remedies. Our management has devoted and may be required to devote significant time and attention to these matters. If any of these matters are resolved adversely against us, it could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, while we cannot estimate our potential exposure to these matters at this time, we have already expended significant amounts investigating the claims underlying and defending these matters and expect to continue to need to expend significant amounts to conclude these matters.\n\u2022\nWe have incurred significant expenses related to the Investigation, restatement and remediation of deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures and expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to the remediation of deficiencies and any resulting litigation. We devoted substantial internal and external resources towards the Investigation, the restatement of our consolidated financial statements, remediation efforts, the management review process and other efforts to implement effective internal controls and expect to continue to incur significant expenses relating to the remediation of deficiencies and any resulting litigation. Because of these efforts, we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur significant fees and expenses for legal, accounting, financial and other consulting and professional services, as well as the implementation and maintenance of systems and processes that will need to be updated, supplemented or replaced. We have taken a number of remediation efforts in response to the independent Investigation. However, there can be no assurance that these steps will be successful. To the extent these steps are not successful, we could be required to incur significant additional time and expense. The expenses and time management devoted towards the Investigation, the restatement and identifying and addressing the internal control deficiencies and the expenses we expect to continue to incur toward addressing the internal control deficiencies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\n\u2022\nPublic health events, including health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to perform work may be significantly affected by public health events. If a public health epidemic or pandemic or other contagious outbreak, including the novel coronavirus (referred to as COVID-19), interferes with our ability, or that of our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers and other business partners to perform our and their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business, our operations may be affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nUnfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business. Volatility in the global financial system, deterioration in general economic activity, and fiscal, monetary and other policies that federal, state and local governments may enact, including infrastructure spending or deficit reduction measures, may have an adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. In particular, low tax revenues, budget deficits, financing constraints, including timing of long-term federal, state and local funding releases, and competing priorities could negatively impact the ability of government agencies to fund existing or new infrastructure projects in the public sector. These factors could have a material adverse effect on the financial market and economic conditions in the United States as well as throughout the world, which may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to obtain financing and/or could impair our ability to execute our acquisition strategy. In addition, levels of new commercial and residential construction projects could be adversely affected by oversupply of existing inventories of commercial and residential properties, low property values and a restrictive financing environment.\n\u2022 We work in a highly competitive marketplace. We have multiple competitors in all of the areas in which we work, and some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater resources than we do. Government funding for public works projects is limited, contributing to competition. An increase in competition may result in a decrease in new awards, a decrease in profit margins, or both. In addition, should downturns in residential and commercial construction activity occur, the competition for available public sector work would intensify, which could impact our revenue, contract backlog and profit margins.\n\u2022 Our financial position could be impacted by worse than anticipated results in our Heavy Civil operating group. We completed our previously announced strategic review of our Heavy Civil operating group and have taken actions that we believe will be beneficial to us and our stockholders. However, the results of our planned actions, and the timing of expected benefits, remain uncertain. In addition, it is possible that we may elect to undertake additional actions related to our Heavy Civil operating group. Our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be materially impacted by underperformance in our Heavy Civil operating group.\n\u2022\nFixed price and fixed unit price contracts subject us to the risk of increased project cost. As more fully described in \u201cContract Provisions and Subcontracting\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business,\u201d the profitability of our fixed price and fixed unit price contracts can be adversely affected by a number of factors that can cause our actual costs to materially exceed the costs estimated at the time of our original bid. This could result in reduced profits or a loss for that project and there could be a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nIn connection with acquisitions or divestitures, we may become subject to liabilities. In connection with any acquisitions, we may acquire liabilities or defects such as legal claims, including but not limited to third party liability and other tort claims; claims for breach of contract; employment-related claims; environmental liabilities, conditions or damage; permitting, regulatory or other compliance with law issues; or tax liabilities. If we acquire any of these liabilities, and they are not adequately covered by insurance or an enforceable indemnity or similar agreement from a creditworthy counterparty, we may be responsible for significant out-of-pocket expenditures. In connection with any divestitures, we may incur liabilities for breaches of representations and warranties or failure to comply with operating covenants under any agreement for a divestiture. In addition, we may indemnify a counterparty in a divestiture for certain liabilities of the subsidiary or operations subject to the divestiture transaction. These liabilities, if they materialize, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nDesign-build contracts subject us to the risk of design errors and omissions. Design-build has become a common method of project delivery as it provides the owner with a single point of responsibility for both design and construction. We generally subcontract design responsibility to architectural and engineering firms. However, in the event of a design error or omission causing damages, there is risk that the subcontractor or their errors and omissions insurance would not be able to absorb the liability. In this case we may be responsible, resulting in a potentially material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nMany of our contracts have penalties for late completion. In some instances, including many of our fixed price contracts, we guarantee that we will complete a project by a certain date. If we subsequently fail to complete the project as scheduled we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages. To the extent these events occur, the total cost of the project could exceed our original estimate and we could experience reduced profits or a loss on that project and there could be a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nOur failure to adequately recover on affirmative claims brought by us against project owners or other project participants (e.g., back charges against subcontractors) for additional contract costs could have a negative impact on our liquidity and future operations. In certain circumstances, we assert affirmative claims against project owners, engineers, consultants, subcontractors or others involved in a project for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. These types of affirmative claims occur due to matters such as delays or changes from the initial project scope, both of which may result in additional costs. Often, these affirmative claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when and on what terms they will be fully resolved. The potential gross profit impact of recoveries for affirmative claims may be material in future periods when they, or a portion of them, become probable and estimable or are settled. When these types of events occur, we use working capital to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant affirmative claims and may incur additional costs when pursuing such potential recoveries. A failure to recover on these types of affirmative claims promptly and fully could have a negative impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. In addition, while clients and subcontractors may be obligated to indemnify us against certain liabilities, such third parties may refuse or be unable to pay us.\n\u2022\nUnavailability of insurance coverage could have a negative effect on our operations and results. We maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall risk management strategy and pursuant to requirements to maintain specific coverage that are contained in our financing agreements and in most of our construction contracts. Although we have been able to obtain reasonably priced insurance coverage to meet our requirements in the past, there is no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future, and our inability to obtain such coverage could have an adverse impact on our ability to procure new work, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nAn inability to obtain bonding could have a negative impact on our operations and results. As more fully described in \"Insurance and Bonding\" under \"Item 1. Business,\" we generally are required to provide surety bonds securing our performance under the majority of our public and private sector contracts. Our inability to obtain reasonably priced surety bonds in the future and, while we monitor the financial health of our insurers and the insurance market, catastrophic events could reduce available limits or the breadth of coverage both of which could significantly affect our ability to be awarded new contracts and could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nWe use certain commodity products that are subject to significant price fluctuations. We are exposed to various commodity price risks, including, but not limited to, diesel fuel, natural gas, propane, steel, cement and liquid asphalt arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business. We use petroleum based products, such as fuels, lubricants, and liquid asphalt, to power or lubricate our equipment, operate our plants, and as a significant ingredient in the asphaltic concrete we manufacture for sale to third parties and use in our asphalt paving construction projects. Although we are partially protected by asphalt or fuel price escalation clauses in some of our contracts, many contracts provide no such protection. We also use steel and other commodities in our construction projects that can be subject to significant price fluctuations. In order to manage or reduce commodity price risk, we monitor the costs of these commodities at the time of bid and price them into our contracts accordingly. Additionally, some of our contracts may include commodity price escalation clauses which partially protect us from increasing prices. At times we enter into supply agreements or pre-purchase commodities to secure pricing and may use financial contracts to further manage price risk. Significant price fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nAs a part of our growth strategy we have made and may make future acquisitions, and acquisitions involve many risks. These risks include:\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing operations;\n\u2022\npotential difficulties and increased costs associated with completion of any assumed construction projects;\n\u2022\ninsufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions and the potential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\nassumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition was negotiated;\n\u2022\ndifficulties relating to assimilating the personnel, services, and systems of an acquired business and to assimilating marketing and other operational capabilities;\n\u2022\nincreased burdens on our staff and on our administrative, internal control and operating systems, which may hinder our legal and regulatory compliance activities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in applying and integrating our system of internal controls to an acquired business;\n\u2022\nif we issue additional equity securities, such issuances could have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing shareholders\u2019 individual ownership percentages in the Company;\n\u2022\nthe recording of goodwill or other non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to subsequent impairment testing and potential impairment charges, as well as amortization expenses related to certain other intangible assets; and\n\u2022\nwhile we often obtain indemnification rights from the sellers of acquired businesses, such rights may be difficult to enforce and the indemnitors may not have the ability to financially support the indemnity.\nFailure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nWeather can significantly affect our revenues and profitability. Our ability to perform work is significantly affected by weather conditions such as precipitation and temperature. Changes in weather conditions can cause delays and otherwise significantly affect our project costs. The impact of weather conditions can result in variability in our quarterly revenues and profitability, particularly in the first and fourth quarters of the year.\n\u2022\nForce majeure events, including natural disasters and terrorists' actions, could negatively impact our business, which may affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Force majeure or extraordinary events beyond the control of the contracting parties, such as natural and man-made disasters, as well as terrorist actions, could negatively impact the economies in which we operate. We typically negotiate contract language where we are allowed certain relief from force majeure events in private client contracts and review and attempt to mitigate force majeure events in both public and private client contracts. We remain obligated to perform our services after most extraordinary events subject to relief that may be available pursuant to a force majeure clause. If we are not able to react quickly to force majeure events, our operations may be affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nOur contract backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and could be an uncertain indicator of our future earnings. We cannot guarantee that the revenues projected in our contract backlog will be realized or, if realized, will be profitable. Projects reflected in our contract backlog may be affected by project cancellations, scope adjustments, time extensions or other changes. Such changes may adversely affect the revenue and profit we ultimately realize on these projects.\n\u2022\nRising inflation and/or interest rates could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Economic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in interest rates, could have a negative impact on our business. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR WORKFORCE, JOINT VENTURES AND SUBCONTRACTORS\n\u2022\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel, joint venture partners and subcontractors in a competitive environment. The success of our business is dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel, joint venture partners, advisors and subcontractors. Changes in general or local economic conditions and the resulting impact on the labor market and on our joint venture partners may make it difficult to attract or retain qualified individuals in the geographic areas where we perform our work. If we are unable to provide competitive compensation packages, high-quality training programs and attractive work environments or to establish and maintain successful partnerships, our reputation, relationships and/or ability to profitably execute our work could be adversely impacted.\n\u2022 Failure to maintain safe work sites could result in significant losses. Construction and maintenance sites are potentially dangerous workplaces and often put our employees and others in close proximity with mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, chemical and manufacturing processes, and highly regulated materials. On many sites, we are responsible for safety and, accordingly, must implement safety procedures. If we fail to implement these procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective, we may suffer the loss of or injury to our employees, as well as expose ourselves to possible litigation. Our failure to maintain adequate safety standards through our safety programs could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or clients, and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022 Strikes or work stoppages could have a negative impact on our operations and results. We are party to collective bargaining agreements covering a portion of our craft workforce. Although strikes or work stoppages have not had a significant impact on our operations or results in the past, such labor actions could have a significant impact on our operations and results if they occur in the future.\n\u2022\nFailure of our subcontractors to perform as anticipated could have a negative impact on our results. As further described in \u201cContract Provisions and Subcontracting\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business,\u201d we subcontract portions of many of our contracts to specialty subcontractors, but we are ultimately responsible for the successful completion of their work. Although we seek to require bonding or other forms of guarantees, we are not always successful in obtaining those bonds or guarantees from our higher-risk subcontractors. We may be responsible for the failures on the part of our subcontractors to perform as anticipated, resulting in a potentially adverse impact on our cash flows and liquidity. In addition, the total costs of a project could exceed our original estimates and we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project, which could have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nOur joint venture contracts subject us to risks and uncertainties, some of which are outside of our control. As further described in Note 1 of \u201cNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d and under \u201cItem 1. Business; Joint Ventures,\u201d we perform certain construction contracts as a limited or minority member of joint ventures. Participating in these arrangements exposes us to risks and uncertainties, including the risk that if our partners fail to perform under joint and several liability contracts, we could be liable for completion of the entire contract. In addition, if our partners are not able or willing to provide their share of capital investment to fund the operations of the venture, there could be unanticipated costs to complete the projects, financial penalties or liquidated damages. These situations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nTo the extent we are not the controlling partner, we have limited control over many of the decisions made with respect to the related construction projects. These joint ventures may not be subject to the same compliance requirements, including those related to internal control over financial reporting. While we have controls to mitigate the risks associated with reliance on their control environment and financial information, to the extent the controlling partner makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control problems arise within the joint venture, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to identify and contract with qualified Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (\u201cDBE\u201d) contractors to perform as subcontractors. Certain of our government agency projects contain minimum DBE participation clauses. Although we have programs in place to ensure compliance, if we fail to complete these projects with the minimum DBE participation, we may be held responsible for breach of contract, which may include restrictions on our ability to bid on future projects as well as monetary damages. To the extent we are responsible for monetary damages, the total costs of the project could exceed our original estimates, we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project and there could be a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nWe may be required to contribute cash to meet our unfunded pension obligations in certain multi-employer plans. As of December 31, 2020, five of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Granite Construction Company, Granite Construction Northeast, Inc., Granite Industrial, Inc., Granite Inliner, LLC, and Layne Christensen Company participate in various domestic multi-employer pension plans on behalf of union employees. Union employee benefits generally are based on a fixed amount for each year of service. We are required to make contributions to the plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements. Pension expense is recognized as contributions are made. The domestic pension plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d). Under ERISA, a contributor to a multi-employer plan may be liable, upon termination or withdrawal from a plan, for its proportionate share of a plan\u2019s unfunded vested liability. While we currently have no intention of withdrawing from a plan and unfunded pension obligations have not significantly affected our operations in the past, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to make material cash contributions to one or more of these plans to satisfy certain underfunded benefit obligations in the future.\nRISKS RELATED TO LEGAL, REGULATORY, ACCOUNTING AND TAX ISSUES\n\u2022 Government contractors are subject to suspension or debarment from government contracting. Government contracts expose us to a variety of risks that differ from those associated with private sector contracts. Various statutes to which our operations are subject, including the Davis-Bacon Act (which regulates wages and benefits), the Walsh-Healy Act (which prescribes a minimum wage and regulates overtime and working conditions), Executive Order 11246 (which establishes equal employment opportunity and affirmative action requirements) and the Drug-Free Workplace Act, provide for mandatory suspension and/or debarment of contractors in certain circumstances involving statutory violations. In addition, the Federal Acquisition Regulation and various state statutes provide for discretionary suspension and/or debarment in certain circumstances that might call into question a contractor's willingness or ability to act responsibly, including as a result of being convicted of, or being found civilly liable for, fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain or performing a public contract or subcontract. The scope and duration of any suspension or debarment may vary depending upon the facts and the statutory or regulatory grounds for debarment and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022 We are involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our business and may in the future be subject to other litigation and legal proceedings, and, if any of these are resolved adversely against us, it could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any litigation or other legal proceedings could result in an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could also suffer an adverse impact on our reputation and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022 Government contracts generally have strict regulatory requirements. Approximately 73.5% of our construction-related revenue in 2020 was derived from contracts funded by federal, state and local government agencies and authorities. Government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations, contract provisions and a variety of socioeconomic requirements relating to their formation, administration, performance and accounting and often include express or implied certifications of compliance. Claims for civil or criminal fraud may be brought for violations of regulations, requirements or statutes. We may also be subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government under the Federal Civil False Claims Act, which could include claims for up to treble damages. Further, if we fail to comply with any of the regulations, requirements or statutes or if we have a substantial number of accumulated Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Mine Safety and Health Administration or other workplace safety violations, our existing government contracts could be terminated and we could be suspended from government contracting or subcontracting, including federally funded projects at the state level. Should one or more of these events occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022 We are subject to environmental and other regulation. As more fully described in \u201cEnvironmental Regulations\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business,\u201d we are subject to a number of federal, state, provincial, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the environment, including the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, emission and discharge of materials into the environment and reclamation and closure of operations, workplace health and safety and a variety of socioeconomic requirements and are required to obtain and maintain a number of environmental approvals, permits and financial assurances. Noncompliance with such laws, regulations and permits can result in, among other things, substantial penalties, or termination or suspension of government contracts or our operations as well as civil and criminal liability. In addition, some environmental laws and regulations impose strict, joint and several liability and responsibility on present and former owners, operators or users of facilities and sites, and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at a third-party site, for contamination at such facilities and sites, without regard to causation or knowledge of contamination. We occasionally evaluate various alternatives with respect to our facilities, including possible dispositions or closures. Investigations undertaken in connection with these activities may lead to discoveries of contamination that must be remediated, and closures of facilities may trigger compliance requirements, including reclamation requirements, that may not be applicable to operating facilities. While compliance with these laws and regulations has not materially adversely affected our operations in the past, there can be no assurance that these requirements, laws or regulations will not change and that compliance will not adversely affect our operations in the future. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that existing or future circumstances or developments with respect to contamination will not require us to make significant remediation or restoration expenditures.\n\u2022\nIncreasing restrictions on securing aggregate reserves could negatively affect our future operations and results. Tighter regulations and the finite nature of property containing suitable aggregate reserves are making it increasingly challenging and costly to secure aggregate reserves. Although we have thus far been able to secure reserves to support our business, our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected by an increasingly difficult permitting process.\n\u2022\nAccounting for our revenues and costs involves significant estimates. As further described in \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d under \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d accounting for our contract-related revenues and costs, as well as other expenses, requires management to make a variety of significant estimates and assumptions. These assumptions and estimates may change significantly in the future and could result in the reversal of previously recognized revenue and profit. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\n\u2022\nA change in tax laws or regulations of any federal, state or international jurisdiction in which we operate could increase our tax burden and otherwise adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We continue to assess the impact of various U.S. federal, state, local and international legislative proposals that could result in a material increase to our U.S. federal, state, local and/or international taxes. We cannot predict whether any specific legislation will be enacted or the terms of any such legislation. However, if such proposals were to be enacted, or if modifications were to be made to certain existing regulations, the consequences could have a material adverse impact on us, including increasing our tax burden, increasing our cost of tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and any determination that we or any of our subsidiaries has violated the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our business. The FCPA generally prohibits companies and their affiliates from making improper payment to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies, procedures and Code of Conduct mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. However, we operate in some countries known to experience corruption. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot provide assurance that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violation of such anti-corruption laws committed by our affiliated entities or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents. We could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant foreign jurisdictions, including prohibition of participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of certain of our assets. Our customers in those jurisdictions could also seek to impose penalties or take other actions adverse to our interest. In addition, we could face other third-party claims by among others, our stockholders, debt holders or other interest holders or constituents. Violations of FCPA laws, allegations of such violations and/or disclosure related to any relevant investigation could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity for reasons including, but not limited to, an adverse effect our reputation, our ability to obtain new business or retain existing business, to attract and retain employees, to access the capital markets and/or could give rise to an event of default under the agreements governing our debt instruments.\nRISKS RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\n\u2022 Changes to our outsourced software or infrastructure vendors as well as any sudden loss, breach of security, disruption or unexpected data or vendor loss associated with our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business. We rely on third-party software and infrastructure to run critical accounting, project management and financial information systems. If software or infrastructure vendors decide to discontinue further development, integration or long-term maintenance support for our information systems, or there is any system interruption, delay, breach of security, loss of data or loss of a vendor, we may need to migrate some or all of our accounting, project management and financial information to other systems. Despite business continuity plans, these disruptions could increase our operational expense as well as impact the management of our business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\u2022 Cybersecurity attacks on or breaches of our information technology environment could result in business interruptions, remediation costs and/or legal claims. To protect confidential customer, vendor, financial and employee information, we employ information security measures that secure our information systems from cybersecurity attacks or breaches. Even with these measures, we may be subject to unauthorized access of digital data with the intent to misappropriate information, corrupt data or cause operational disruptions. If a failure of our safeguarding measures were to occur, or if software or third-party vendors that support our information technology environment are compromised, it could have a negative impact to our business and result in business interruptions, remediation costs and/or legal claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE\n\u2022 Failure to remain in compliance with covenants under our Credit Agreement, service our indebtedness, or fund our other liquidity needs could adversely impact our business. Our failure to comply with any of the restrictive or financial covenants would constitute an event of default under our Credit Agreement. Further, our failure to obtain a waiver or amendments relating to our non-compliance with any of the restrictive or financial covenants could result in an event of default under our Credit Agreement. Our failure to pay principal, interest or other amounts when due or within the relevant grace period on our 2.75% Convertible Notes or our Credit Agreement would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing our 2.75% Convertible Notes or the Credit Agreement. A default under our Credit Agreement could result in (i) us no longer being entitled to borrow under such facility; (ii) termination of such facility; (iii) the requirement that any letters of credit under such facility be cash collateralized; (iv) acceleration of amounts owed under the Credit Agreement; and/or (v) foreclosure on any lien securing the obligations under such facility. A default under the indenture governing our 2.75% Convertible Notes could result in acceleration of the maturity of the notes. If we are unable to service our debt obligations or fund our other liquidity needs, we could be forced to curtail our operations, reorganize our capital structure (including through bankruptcy proceedings) or liquidate some or all of our assets in a manner that could cause holders of our securities to experience a partial or total loss of their investment in us.\n\u2022\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including our 2.75% Convertible Notes and the obligations under our Credit Agreement, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the financial markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\n\u2022\nThe convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of our common stock. In connection with our 2.75% Convertible Notes offering, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with option counterparties. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon conversion of the 2.75% Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we elect to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants and we deliver shares of our common stock upon exercise of such warrants instead of paying cash. Additionally, in connection with establishing their initial hedge of the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the option counterparties may have entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. The option counterparties may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions. This activity could cause an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock. The effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but these activities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions. The option counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more of such option counterparties may default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties is not, and will not be, secured by any collateral. If any option counterparty becomes subject to bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings with respect to such option counterparty\u2019s obligations under the relevant convertible note hedge transaction, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under such transaction. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be positively correlated to an increase in our common stock market price and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by an option counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. While all option counterparties were deemed to be of suitable financial strength on the transaction date, we can provide no assurance as to the financial stability or viability of any option counterparty.\n\u2022\nThe price of our common stock historically has been volatile. Our stock price may continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the other factors discussed in \u201cRisks Factors\u201d; variations in our quarterly operating results from our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors; downward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates; and announcement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments. In addition, the sale or the availability for sale of a large number of shares of common stock in the public market may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\n\u2022\nDelaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could reduce the market price of our common stock. We are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our Board of Directors has the power, without stockholder approval, to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock. The ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nThe foregoing list is not all-inclusive. There can be no assurance that we have correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting our business or that the publicly available and other information with respect to these matters is complete and correct. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect us. These developments could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. For these reasons, the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.", "PERMNO": 76135, "SIC": 1600, "TIC": "GVA"}
