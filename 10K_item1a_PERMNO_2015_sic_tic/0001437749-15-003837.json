RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s common stock involves risks. The following is a description of the material risks and uncertainties that the Company believes affect its business and an investment in the common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that the Company is unaware of, or that it currently deems immaterial, also may become important factors that affect the Company and its business. If any of the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were to occur, the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of the common stock could decline significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Associated with the Company\u2019s Business\nIf the Company is not able to continue its historical levels of growth, it may not be able to maintain its historical earnings trends.\nTo achieve its past levels of growth, the Company has focused on both internal growth and acquisitions. The Company may not be able to sustain its historical rate of growth or may not be able to grow at all. More specifically, the Company may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to fund additional growth and may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates. Various factors, such as economic conditions and competition, may impede or prohibit the opening of new banking centers and the completion of acquisitions. Further, the Company may be unable to attract and retain experienced bankers, which could adversely affect its internal growth. If the Company is not able to continue its historical levels of growth, it may not be able to maintain its historical earnings trends.\nIf the Company is unable to manage its growth effectively, its operations could be negatively affected.\nCompanies that experience rapid growth face various risks and difficulties, including:\n\u2022\nfinding suitable markets for expansion;\n\u2022\nfinding suitable candidates for acquisition;\n\u2022\nattracting funding to support additional growth;\n\u2022\nmaintaining asset quality;\n\u2022\nattracting and retaining qualified management; and\n\u2022\nmaintaining adequate regulatory capital.\nIn addition, in order to manage its growth and maintain adequate information and reporting systems within its organization, the Company must identify, hire and retain additional qualified associates, particularly in the accounting and operational areas of its business.\nIf the Company does not manage its growth effectively, its business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be negatively affected, and the Company may not be able to continue to implement its business strategy and successfully conduct its operations.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the primary markets in Texas and Oklahoma in which it operates and where its loans are concentrated. The local economic conditions in Texas and Oklahoma have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s commercial, real estate and construction, land development and other land loans, the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. Accordingly, if the population or income growth in the Company\u2019s market areas is slower than projected, income levels, deposits and housing starts could be adversely affected and could result in a reduction of the Company\u2019s expansion, growth and profitability. While Texas and Oklahoma fared well through the Great Recession, if prolonged, the recent decline in oil prices may negatively impact economic conditions in these areas. If the Company\u2019s market areas experience a downturn or a recession for a prolonged period of time, the Company could experience significant increases in nonperforming loans, which could lead to operating losses, impaired liquidity and eroding capital. A significant decline in general economic conditions, caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, outbreaks of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to interest rate risk and fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s assets are monetary in nature and, as a result, the Company is subject to significant risk from changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates can impact the Company\u2019s net interest income as well as the valuation of its assets and liabilities. The Company\u2019s earnings are significantly dependent on its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income earned on loans, investments and other interest-earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities.\nChanges in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence the interest the Company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, and could also affect (1) the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (2) the fair value of the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities and (3) the average duration of the Company\u2019s mortgage-backed securities portfolio. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, the Company\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments decrease more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. Further, the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions because there may be mismatches between the repricing or maturity characteristics of the assets and liabilities. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Company is unable to identify and acquire other financial institutions and successfully integrate its acquired businesses, its business and earnings may be negatively affected.\nThe market for acquisitions remains highly competitive, and the Company may be unable to find acquisition candidates in the future that fit its acquisition and growth strategy. To the extent that the Company is unable to find suitable acquisition candidates, an important component of its growth strategy may be lost.\nAcquisitions of financial institutions involve operational risks and uncertainties and acquired companies may have unforeseen liabilities, exposure to asset quality problems, key employee and customer retention problems and other problems that could negatively affect the Company\u2019s organization. The Company may not be able to complete future acquisitions and, if completed, the Company may not be able to successfully integrate the operations, management, products and services of the entities that it acquires and eliminate redundancies. The integration process could result in the loss of key employees or disruption of the combined entity\u2019s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction. The integration process may also require significant time and attention from the Company\u2019s management that they would otherwise direct at servicing existing business and developing new business. The Company\u2019s inability to find suitable acquisition candidates and failure to successfully integrate the entities it acquires into its existing operations may increase its operating costs significantly and adversely affect its business and earnings.\nThe Company\u2019s dependence on loans secured by real estate subjects it to risks relating to fluctuations in the real estate market that could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nApproximately 75.1% of the Company\u2019s total loans as of December 31, 2014 consisted of loans included in the real estate loan portfolio, with 36.7% in commercial real estate (including farmland and multifamily residential), 27.3% in residential real estate (including home equity) and 11.1% in construction, land development and other land loans. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. A weakening of the real estate market in the Company\u2019s primary market areas could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, the value of real estate and other collateral securing the loans and the value of real estate owned by the Company. If real estate values decline, it is also more likely that the Company would be required to increase its allowance for credit losses, which could adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company\u2019s commercial real estate and commercial loans expose it to increased credit risks, and these risks will increase if the Company succeeds in increasing these types of loans.\nThe Company, while maintaining its conservative approach to lending, has emphasized both new and existing loan products, focusing on managing its commercial real estate (including farmland and multifamily residential) and commercial loan portfolios, and intends to continue to increase its lending activities and acquire loans in possible future acquisitions. As a result, commercial real estate and commercial loans as a proportion of its portfolio could increase. As of December 31, 2014, commercial real estate (including farmland and multifamily residential) and commercial loans totaled $5.20 billion. In general, commercial real estate loans and commercial loans yield higher returns and often generate a deposit relationship, but also pose greater credit risks than do owner-occupied residential real estate loans. These types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans. Accordingly, the deterioration of one or several of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans, which could result in a loss of earnings from these loans and an increase in the provision for credit losses and net charge-offs.\nThe Company makes both secured and some unsecured commercial loans. Unsecured loans generally involve a higher degree of risk of loss than do secured loans because, without collateral, repayment is wholly dependent upon the success of the borrowers\u2019 businesses. Secured commercial loans are generally collateralized by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or other assets owned by the borrower and include a personal guaranty of the business owner. Compared to real estate, that type of collateral is more difficult to monitor, its value is harder to ascertain, it may depreciate more rapidly and it may not be as readily saleable if repossessed. Further, commercial loans generally will be serviced primarily from the operation of the business, which may not be successful, while commercial real estate loans generally will be serviced from income on the properties securing the loans. As the Company\u2019s various commercial loan portfolios increase, the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans will also increase.\nThe Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover actual credit losses, which could adversely affect its earnings.\nAs a lender, the Company is exposed to the risk that its loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to fully compensate the Company for the outstanding balance of the loan plus the costs to dispose of the collateral. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses in an attempt to cover estimated losses inherent in its loan portfolio. Additional credit losses will likely occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than the Company has experienced to date. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Company to make significant estimates of current credit risks, future trends and general economic conditions, all of which may undergo material changes. If the Company\u2019s assumptions prove to be incorrect or if it experiences significant credit losses in future periods, its current allowance may not be sufficient to cover actual credit losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in its loan portfolio. A material addition to the allowance could cause net income, and possibly capital, to decrease.\nIn addition, federal and state regulators periodically review the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses and may require the Company to increase its provision for credit losses or recognize further charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of the Company\u2019s management. An increase in the Company\u2019s allowance for credit losses or charge-offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\nThe small to medium-sized businesses that the Company lends to may have fewer resources to weather a downturn in the economy, which could materially harm the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company makes loans to privately-owned businesses, many of which are considered to be small to medium-sized businesses. Small to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market share than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience significant volatility in operating results. Any one or more of these factors may impair the borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small to medium-sized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two persons or a small group of persons, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay a loan. Economic downturns and other events that negatively impact the Company\u2019s market areas could cause the Company to incur substantial credit losses that could negatively affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nLiquidity risk could impair the Company\u2019s ability to fund operations and jeopardize its financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to the Company\u2019s business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on its liquidity. The Company\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities or on terms which are acceptable to it could be impaired by factors that affect the Company specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact the Company\u2019s access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of its business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which its loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against it. The Company\u2019s ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to it, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets.\nIf the goodwill that the Company recorded in connection with a business acquisition becomes impaired, it could require charges to earnings.\nGoodwill represents the amount by which the acquisition cost exceeds the fair value of net assets the Company acquired in the purchase of another financial institution. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset might be impaired.\nThe Company determines impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in the Company\u2019s results of operations in the periods in which they become known. At December 31, 2014, the Company\u2019s goodwill totaled $1.87 billion. While the Company has not recorded any such impairment charges since it initially recorded the goodwill, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s future evaluations of goodwill will not result in findings of impairment and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models and tools.\nThe processes the Company uses to estimate its probable credit losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, depends upon the use of analytical and forecasting models and tools. These models and tools reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if these assumptions are accurate, the models and tools may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation. Any such failure in the Company\u2019s analytical or forecasting models and tools could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Company. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nThe Company may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet regulatory capital requirements or its commitments and business needs. In addition, the Company may elect to raise additional capital to support its business or to finance acquisitions, if any. The Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of its control, and its financial performance.\nThe Company cannot assure you that such capital will be available to it on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit its access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of investors, depositors of Prosperity Bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s capital costs and its ability to raise capital and, in turn, its liquidity. Moreover, if the Company needs to raise capital in the future, it may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject the Company to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, the Company may implement or may acquire new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, the Company may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn interruption in or breach in security of the Company\u2019s information systems may result in a loss of customer business and have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems, whether caused by physical damage, hackers, viruses or other malware, could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through the Company\u2019s computer systems and network infrastructure as well as result in failures or disruptions in the Company\u2019s customer relationship management, general ledger, deposits, servicing or loan origination systems. While the Company maintains specific \u201ccyber\u201d insurance coverage, which would apply in the event of various breach scenarios, the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case. In addition, cyber threat scenarios are inherently difficult to predict and can take many forms, some of which may not be covered under the Company\u2019s cyber insurance coverage. Although the Company, with the help of third-party service providers, has and intends to continue to implement security technology and operational procedures to prevent such damage, there can be no assurance that these security measures will entirely mitigate these risks. In addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms the Company and its third- party service providers use to protect client transaction data. The occurrence of any such failures, interruptions or security breaches could damage the Company\u2019s reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to certain risks in connection with its use of technology.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The Company\u2019s future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as create additional efficiencies in its operations. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers, which may negatively affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Further, as technology advances, the ability to initiate transactions and access data has become more widely distributed among mobile devices, personal computers, automated teller machines, remote deposit capture sites and similar access points. These technological advances increase cybersecurity risk. While the Company maintains programs intended to prevent or limit the effects of cybersecurity risk, there is no assurance that unauthorized transactions or unauthorized access to customer information will not occur. The financial, reputational and regulatory impact of unauthorized transactions or unauthorized access to customer information could be significant.\nThe Company\u2019s operations rely on external vendors.\nThe Company relies on certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations of the Company. These third parties provide key components of the Company\u2019s business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While the Company has selected these third-party vendors carefully, it does not control their actions. Any complications caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, cyber-attacks and security breaches at a vendor, failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third-party vendor could also hurt the Company\u2019s operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendor's ability to provide services. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s vendors could also be sources of operational and information security risk, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Replacing these third-party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Problems caused by external vendors could be disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and, in turn, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by security breaches at third parties.\nThe Company\u2019s customers interact with their own and other third party systems, which pose operational risks to the Company. The Company may be adversely affected by data breaches at retailers and other third parties who maintain data relating to the Company\u2019s customers that involve the theft of customer data, including the theft of customers' debit card, credit card, wire transfer and other identifying and/or access information used to make purchases or payments at such retailers and to other third parties. Despite third-party security risks that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, the Company offers its customers protection against fraud and attendant losses for unauthorized use of debit and credit cards in order to stay competitive in the marketplace. Offering such protection to customers exposes the Company to significant expenses and potential losses related to reimbursing the Company\u2019s customers for fraud losses, reissuing the compromised cards and increased monitoring for suspicious activity. In the event of a data breach at one or more retailers of considerable magnitude, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to intellectual property.\nBanking and other financial services companies, such as the Company, rely on technology companies to provide information technology products and services necessary to support the Company\u2019s day-to-day operations. Technology companies frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. Competitors of the Company\u2019s vendors, or other individuals or companies, have from time to time claimed to hold intellectual property sold to the Company by its vendors. Such claims may increase in the future as the financial services sector becomes more reliant on information technology vendors. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the Company may have to engage in protracted litigation. Such litigation is often expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations and distracting to management. If the Company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third-party. In certain cases, the Company may consider entering into licensing agreements for disputed intellectual property, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly increase the Company\u2019s operating expenses. If legal matters related to intellectual property claims were resolved against the Company or settled, the Company could be required to make payments in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility.\nFrom time to time, customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to the Company\u2019s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to the Company\u2019s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they may result in significant financial liability, adversely affect the market perception of the Company and its products and services and/or impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company operates in a highly regulated environment and, as a result, is subject to extensive regulation and supervision.\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not the Company\u2019s shareholders. These regulations affect the Company\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on the Company, the Bank and their respective operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector during the several years prior to the implementation of such Act. Additional legislation and regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could significantly affect the Company\u2019s powers, authority and operations, or the powers, authority and operations of the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. Further, regulators have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. The exercise of this regulatory discretion and power could have a negative impact on the Company. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework may not be effective in identifying, managing or mitigating risks and/or losses to it.\nThe Company has implemented a risk management framework to identify and manage its risk exposure. This framework is comprised of various processes, systems and strategies, and is designed to manage the types of risk to which the Company is subject, including, among others, credit, market, liquidity, operational, financial, interest rate, legal and regulatory, compliance, strategic, reputation, fiduciary and general economic risks. The Company\u2019s framework also includes financial or other modeling methodologies, which involves management assumptions and judgment. In addition, under this framework, the Company has developed a risk appetite statement to detail its risk tolerance levels at an enterprise-wide level. There is no assurance that this risk management framework will be effective under all circumstances or that it will adequately identify, manage or mitigate any risk or loss to the Company. If this framework is not effective, the Company may be subject to potentially adverse regulatory consequences and could suffer unexpected losses and its financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company is subject to losses resulting from fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants, correspondents or other third parties.\nThe Company relies heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including the information contained in credit applications, property appraisals, title information, equipment pricing and valuation and employment and income documentation, in deciding which loans the Company will originate, as well as the terms of those loans. If any of the information upon which the Company relies is misrepresented, either fraudulently or inadvertently, and the misrepresentation is not detected prior to asset funding, the value of the asset may be significantly lower than expected, or the Company may fund a loan that it would not have funded or on terms it would not have extended. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the applicant or another third party, the Company generally bears the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. A loan subject to a material misrepresentation is typically unsellable or subject to repurchase if it is sold prior to detection of the misrepresentation. The sources of the misrepresentations are often difficult to locate, and it is often difficult to recover any of the monetary losses the Company may suffer.\nThe Company is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Company may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, the Company may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require the Company to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit the Company\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase the Company\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. Although the Company has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Associated with the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe Company\u2019s corporate organizational documents and the provisions of Texas law to which it is subject may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that a shareholder may favor.\nThe Company\u2019s amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain various provisions which may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change of control of the Company. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na board of directors classified into three classes of directors with the directors of each class having staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\na provision that any special meeting of the Company\u2019s shareholders may be called only by the chairman of the board and chief executive officer, the president, a majority of the board of directors or the holders of at least 50% of the Company\u2019s shares entitled to vote at the meeting;\n\u2022\na provision establishing certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at an annual or special meeting of shareholders; and\n\u2022\na provision that denies shareholders the right to amend the Company\u2019s bylaws.\nThe Company\u2019s articles of incorporation provide for noncumulative voting for directors and authorize the board of directors to issue shares of its preferred stock without shareholder approval and upon such terms as the board of directors may determine. The issuance of the Company\u2019s preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a controlling interest in the Company. In addition, certain provisions of Texas law, including a provision which restricts certain business combinations between a Texas corporation and certain affiliated shareholders, may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change in control of the Company.\nThere are restrictions on the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends.\nHolders of the Company\u2019s common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as the Company\u2019s Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although the Company has historically declared cash dividends on its common stock, it is not required to do so and there can be no assurance that the Company will pay dividends in the future. Any declaration and payment of dividends on common stock will depend upon the Company\u2019s earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate, the Company\u2019s ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to the common stock and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors.\nThe Company\u2019s principal source of funds to pay dividends on the shares of common stock is cash dividends that the Company receives from the Bank. Various banking laws applicable to the Bank limit the payment of dividends and other distributions by the Bank to the Company, and may therefore limit the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends on its common stock. Further, if required payments on the Company\u2019s outstanding junior subordinated debentures held by its unconsolidated subsidiary trusts are not made or are suspended, the Company will be prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock.\nThe holders of the Company\u2019s junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of the Company\u2019s shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had $167.5 million in junior subordinated debentures outstanding that were issued to the Company\u2019s unconsolidated subsidiary trusts or assumed by the Company in connection with an acquisition. Since that date, the Company has redeemed $41.2 million of the junior subordinated debentures and provided irrevocable notice of its intent to redeem the remaining junior subordinated debentures. The subsidiary trusts purchased the junior subordinated debentures from the Company using the proceeds from the sale of trust preferred securities to third party investors. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities are conditionally guaranteed by the Company to the extent not paid or made by each trust, provided the trust has funds available for such obligations.\nThe junior subordinated debentures are senior to the Company\u2019s shares of common stock. As a result, the Company must make interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) before any dividends can be paid on its common stock; and, in the event of the Company\u2019s bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of the common stock. Additionally, the Company has the right to defer periodic distributions on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) for up to five years, during which time the Company would be prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock. The Company\u2019s ability to pay the future distributions depends upon the earnings of the Bank and dividends from the Bank to the Company, which may be inadequate to service the obligations.", "PERMNO": 86432, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PB"}
