{"cik": "1105705", "company": "TIME WARNER INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe Company must respond successfully to ongoing changes in the U.S. television industry and consumer viewing patterns to remain competitive. The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenues and profits from its cable networks and premium pay television services and the production and licensing of television programming to broadcast and cable networks and premium pay television services. The U.S. television industry is continuing to evolve rapidly, with developments in technology leading to new methods for the distribution of video content and changes in when, where and how audiences consume video content. These changes pose risks to the traditional U.S. television industry and some of the Company\u2019s longest-standing business models, including (i) the disruption of the traditional television content distribution model by OTT services, which are increasing in number and some of which have significant and growing subscriber/user bases, and (ii) the disruption of the advertising-supported television model resulting from increased video consumption through OTT services, time shifted viewing of television programming and the use of DVRs to skip advertisements. In part as a result of these changes, over the past few years, the number of subscribers to multichannel video services provided by traditional affiliates (\u201ctraditional MVPD services\u201d) in the U.S. has declined each year and the U.S. television industry has experienced declines in ratings for programming, which have negatively affected subscription and advertising revenues. Developments in technology and new content delivery products and services have also led to an increasing amount of video content that is available through OTT services and consumers spending an increased amount of time viewing such content, as well as changes in consumers\u2019 expectations regarding the availability of video content, their willingness to pay for access to or ownership of such content, their perception of what quality entertainment is and how much it should cost, and their\ntolerance for commercial interruptions. The Company is engaged in efforts to respond to and mitigate the risks from these changes, such as initiatives to improve the monetization of television advertising, but the success of some of these initiatives depends in part on the cooperation of measurement companies, advertisers, affiliates and others and, therefore, is not entirely within the Company\u2019s control. The Company may incur significant costs to implement its strategy and initiatives, and if they are not successful, the Company\u2019s competitive position, businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe popularity of content is difficult to predict and can change rapidly, and low public acceptance of the Company\u2019s content could adversely affect its results of operations. The revenues derived from the sale, distribution and licensing of television programming, feature films, games and other content depend primarily on widespread public acceptance of that content, which is difficult to predict and can change rapidly. The Company must invest substantial amounts in the production and marketing of its content before it learns whether such content will reach anticipated levels of popularity with consumers. The popularity of the Company\u2019s content depends on many factors, only some of which are within the Company\u2019s control. Examples include the popularity, quality and amount of competing content (including, in addition to traditional competitors in media and entertainment, locally-produced content internationally and content available on OTT services, some of which have large and growing subscriber/user bases and are significantly increasing their programming investments), the availability of alternative forms of leisure and entertainment activities, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain or develop strong brand awareness and target key audiences, and the Company\u2019s ability to successfully anticipate (and timely adapt its content to) changes in consumer tastes in the many countries and territories in which the Company operates. Low public acceptance of the Company\u2019s content could adversely affect its results of operations.\nAs a significant element of the Company\u2019s strategy, Warner Bros. focuses on building global franchises based on existing intellectual property that it can monetize across its businesses and distribution channels. Generally, feature films that perform well at the global box office also have commercial success in subsequent distribution channels. The underperformance of a feature film, especially an \u201cevent\u201d film, at the global box office typically results in lower than expected revenues for the Company from the license of the film to broadcast and cable networks and OTT services, sales of the film in digital and physical formats, and from the sale of games or licenses for consumer products based on such film. If a new \u201cevent\u201d film fails to achieve commercial success at the global box office, it would also limit the Company\u2019s ability to create a new theatrical franchise based on the film or characters featured in the film. The failure to develop successful new theatrical franchises could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nSimilarly, the failure to develop popular new programming to replace programming that is older or ending can have adverse impacts on the operating results for the Company\u2019s Turner and Home Box Office segments. Low ratings for television programming produced by the Company may lead to the cancellation of a program and can negatively affect future license fees for the cancelled program. A decline in the ratings or popularity of the television programming aired on Turner\u2019s cable networks can negatively affect advertising revenues for Turner\u2019s cable networks in the near term and, over a longer period of time, could adversely affect subscription revenues and the distribution potential of a Turner network. A decline in the popularity of HBO\u2019s and Cinemax\u2019s programming could, over a period of time, cause subscribers to cancel their subscriptions, which in turn could adversely affect both the Company\u2019s subscription and content licensing revenues. If the Company decides to no longer air programming due to low ratings or other factors, the Company could incur significant programming impairments, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations in a given period.\nThe failure to enter into or renew agreements with affiliates on favorable terms or at all could cause the Company\u2019s subscription and advertising revenues to decline. The Company depends on agreements with affiliates for the distribution of the Company\u2019s cable networks and premium pay television services and certain of its OTT services. Competition from third-party OTT services and new distribution platforms and declines in subscribers to traditional MVPD services are increasing the pressure on affiliates to control their programming costs in order to operate at a profit while offering their services at competitive prices that enable them to attract and retain subscribers. As affiliates continue to try to control their programming costs, it may be more difficult for the Company to secure favorable terms, including those related to pricing, positioning and packaging, during affiliate agreement negotiations, and the Company may face greater difficulty in achieving placement of its networks and premium pay television services in smaller bundles or virtual MVPDs offered by affiliates. Factors that may make it more difficult for the Company to secure favorable terms during renewal negotiations with traditional affiliates include the Company\u2019s efforts to capitalize on new growth opportunities outside the traditional TV ecosystem and the consolidation of traditional affiliates in the U.S. and growth of large multi-territory distribution companies\ninternationally, which increases their scale and negotiating power. In addition, the Company\u2019s potential merger with AT&T may make it more difficult for the Company to secure favorable terms during renewal negotiations with other affiliates. If the Company is not able to secure favorable terms when it enters into or renews its affiliate agreements, its subscription revenues may not increase as much as the Company expects or could decline. In addition, if the Company and an affiliate reach an impasse in contract renewal negotiations, applicable networks or premium pay television services could become unavailable to the affiliate\u2019s subscribers (i.e., \u201cgo dark\u201d), which, depending on the length of time and the size of the affiliate, could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s subscription and advertising revenues. The inability to renew one or more of the Company\u2019s larger affiliate arrangements would reduce the number of households that have access to Turner\u2019s cable networks and result in lower ratings for programming, which could make those networks less attractive to advertisers and result in lower growth or a decline in advertising revenues.\nIf the rate of decline in the number of subscribers to traditional MVPD services increases or these subscribers shift to other services or bundles that do not include the Company\u2019s cable networks and premium pay television services, the Company\u2019s subscription revenues could be negatively affected. During the last few years, the number of subscribers to traditional MVPD services in the U.S. has been declining each year, and the Company expects these declines will continue and possibly accelerate. If traditional MVPD service offerings are not attractive to consumers due to pricing, increased competition from OTT services, increased dissatisfaction with the quality of traditional MVPD services, worse economic conditions or other factors, more consumers may (i) cancel their traditional MVPD service subscriptions or choose not to subscribe to traditional MVPD services, (ii) cancel their subscriptions to premium pay television services, (iii) elect to subscribe to lower-priced OTT services or (iv) elect to subscribe to smaller bundles of networks offered by traditional affiliates or to virtual MVPD services, which may not include HBO, Cinemax or some (or any) of Turner\u2019s cable networks. The number of HBO and Cinemax subscribers could also decline if affiliates choose not to market, or reduce their marketing of, HBO or Cinemax. If the rate of decline in the number of traditional MVPD service subscribers increases or if subscribers shift to lower-cost OTT services or to smaller bundles of networks or virtual MVPD services that do not include all the Company\u2019s cable networks and premium pay television services, the Company\u2019s subscription revenues could be negatively affected.\nA decrease in demand for the television programming produced by Warner Bros. or changes in the terms for licensed programming could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and results of operations. Warner Bros. is a leading producer of high-quality television programming, as well as a leader in the international distribution of U.S.-produced television programming. Even with its strong competitive position, Warner Bros.\u2019 television production business is largely dependent on the strength of the U.S. broadcast networks, basic cable networks, local television stations and OTT services, and their continued demand for Warner Bros.\u2019 television programming (both in initial release windows and subsequent distribution windows). If there is a decline in such demand, it could decrease the overall scale of Warner Bros.\u2019 television production business and reduce the aggregate license fees for its television programming. The following factors could increase the likelihood of a decline in such demand in the U.S.: (i) networks favoring programming from their in-house and affiliated television production studios over Warner Bros.\u2019 programming, in part because ownership of the programming enables the networks to control, manage and monetize the programming in subsequent domestic and international distribution windows; (ii) emerging technologies and alternative viewing options that could reduce the lifetime value of television programming; (iii) consolidation among television networks, OTT services and/or television station groups, thereby reducing the number of buyers for Warner Bros.\u2019 programming; (iv) OTT services shifting from primarily distributing programming produced by third parties to developing and distributing original programming produced by their in-house or affiliated production studios; and (v) a significant decline in viewing of content on television networks due to a shift toward viewing of content on other platforms and/or toward viewing of shorter-form video content, including on social media platforms. The increasing revenue opportunities in subsequent distribution windows can also result in U.S. networks seeking to co-produce programming that they license from Warner Bros. in order to share in revenue opportunities for the programming in subsequent distribution windows. In addition, international licensing is a key driver of the profitability of the Company\u2019s U.S.-produced television programming and the increasing popularity of locally-produced television content in international territories also could result in decreased demand and lower license fees for the Company\u2019s U.S.-produced television programming, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nAn increase in the costs to acquire or produce popular programming could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results. Competition to acquire popular programming (particularly sports programming) is intense both in the U.S. and internationally among networks, premium pay television services and OTT services, and, as competition from these networks\nand services continues to increase, the Company may not be able to acquire popular programming or to acquire it at a cost-effective price. More networks, premium pay television services and OTT services are seeking to offer distinctive programming, including sports programming, and are willing to invest more (and in some cases, significantly more) to do so. At times, Turner and Home Box Office have had to increase the prices they are willing to pay for sports and acquired programming, including the renewal of licensed programming, and have been outbid by competitors, which could occur again in the future. In addition, the increased investments by networks, premium pay television services and OTT services in high quality original programming may make it more challenging for Home Box Office, Turner and Warner Bros. to attract and retain talent and could drive up talent and production costs. Increased competition has also forced some networks and OTT services to commit to straight-to-series orders for programming instead of a pilot order. If Home Box Office or Turner commits to straight-to-series orders and those series do not meet anticipated production or quality standards or are otherwise not accepted by audiences, revisions to the programming may be necessary, which could increase production costs. The increased financial commitment for a straight-to-series order also could increase the risks associated with such an order. If increases in Warner Bros.\u2019 costs to produce programming are not offset by higher content licensing revenues or if increases in Turner\u2019s and Home Box Office\u2019s costs to produce or acquire popular programming are not offset by increases in subscription revenues and increases in advertising revenues for Turner\u2019s cable networks, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected if there are further declines in television advertising spending, which could be caused by a number of factors. As described above, the traditional advertising-supported television business model has experienced disruption in recent years. See \u201cThe Company must respond successfully to ongoing changes in the U.S. television industry and consumer viewing patterns to remain competitive.\u201d The advantages of digital advertising and the increased amount of consumer time spent online and on mobile activities have resulted in advertisers shifting more of their advertising budgets away from traditional television advertising to digital advertising, and Google and Facebook, with their large user bases, high consumer engagement and ability to use their data to target consumers, track consumer behavior and measure consumer responsiveness to advertising, have captured a significant and growing portion of digital advertising expenditures. Television advertising expenditures could be further negatively affected in the future by the continuation or worsening of the trends associated with the disruption of the advertising-supported television business model. These include:\n\u2022\nfurther shifts in consumer behavior patterns, including consumers spending even more time online and on mobile activities;\n\u2022\nfurther declines in the number of traditional MVPD service subscribers;\n\u2022\nincreased viewership of television programming on demand on a time-delayed basis (to the extent it either does not contain advertising or such viewing is not measured for audience delivery purposes) and the increased use of DVRs to skip television advertisements; and\n\u2022\ndeclining audience ratings for television programming.\nIf ratings for the programming aired on Turner\u2019s cable networks decline, demand by advertisers to purchase time on Turner networks may fall. If ratings decline significantly, Turner\u2019s cable networks generally will be required to provide additional advertising time to advertisers to reach agreed-on audience delivery thresholds. This may result in Turner\u2019s cable networks having less advertising time available to sell or use to promote their own programming. In addition, although audience measurement systems have improved and better capture the viewership of programming through DVRs, affiliates\u2019 and networks\u2019 VOD offerings and digital platforms and devices, they still do not fully capture all viewership and advertisers may not be willing to pay advertising rates based on the viewership that is not being measured. As described above in \u201cItem 1. Business - Turner,\u201d Turner is engaged in a variety of efforts to make advertising on its networks more valuable to advertisers and improve the consumer experience; however, these efforts may not be successful or may take several years to become successful.\nAdditional factors that could negatively impact television advertising revenues include:\n\u2022\na decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general;\n\u2022\nincreasing audience fragmentation caused by increased availability of alternative forms of leisure and entertainment activities;\n\u2022\npressure from public interest groups to reduce or eliminate advertising of certain products on television;\n\u2022\nnew laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict certain types of advertisements; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, extreme weather, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities resulting in uninterrupted news coverage of such events that disrupts regular television programming.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations may be adversely affected by shifts in home entertainment consumption patterns. Several factors have contributed to an industry-wide decline in sales of home entertainment product in physical formats in recent years, including consumers shifting to OTT service subscriptions and, to a lesser degree, digital purchases and transactional VOD rentals of content; changing retailer initiatives and strategies (e.g., reduction in floor space devoted to home entertainment product in physical formats); retail store closures; increasing competition for consumer discretionary time and spending; and piracy. Although digital sales represent an increasing share of total sales of film and television content and, with greater per-unit profitability, have helped offset some of the declines in physical sales of content, digital sales may never generate aggregate profits that equal or exceed the peak profits generated by physical sales in prior years or it may take several years for the increased profits from higher-margin digital sales to fully offset the decrease in lower-margin physical sales and rentals. In addition, if OTT service subscriptions continue to gain in popularity, they may cause further reductions in consumer spending on home entertainment product in physical formats.\nIf the Company fails to compete successfully against alternative sources of entertainment and news, there may be an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. The Company competes for consumers\u2019 leisure and entertainment time and discretionary spending with all other sources of entertainment and news, including television networks, premium pay television services, OTT services, feature films, the Internet, home entertainment products and services, games, print media, pirated content, live sports and other events. The increased number of media and entertainment choices available to consumers has made it much more difficult to attract and obtain their attention and time. Moreover, the environment in which the Company competes is becoming more challenging with the shifts in consumer viewing patterns, increased competition from OTT services and due to companies, in particular technology companies, expanding into the production of film and television programming. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors.\nThe Company is exposed to risks associated with weak economic conditions, geopolitical and economic uncertainties and increased volatility and disruption in the financial markets. The Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by weak economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries where the Company does business and the impact of those conditions on advertisers, affiliates, suppliers, retailers, insurers, theater operators and others with which it does business. The global economy continues to be volatile, with slower economic growth in some large economies such as China, India and Brazil and economic uncertainties arising from governmental actions in some countries such as Russia and Venezuela. Additional geopolitical or economic uncertainties have resulted from the 2016 U.S. Presidential and Congressional elections and the United Kingdom\u2019s planned departure from the European Union, the formal two-year process for which began in March 2017. The full impact of these events is unknown, but likely will include changes in international trade policies.\nWeak economic conditions and geopolitical and economic uncertainties could lead to lower consumer spending for the Company\u2019s content and products in these regions and countries, particularly if advertisers, licensees, retailers, theater operators and consumers reduce their demand for the Company\u2019s content and products due to the negative impact of these conditions and uncertainties on them. Consumer spending in these regions and countries may be further negatively impacted by governmental actions to manage national economic matters, whether through austerity or stimulus measures or initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability, inflation, international trade, taxation and other economic drivers.\nIncreased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets could make it more difficult and more expensive for the Company to refinance outstanding indebtedness and obtain new financing. The adoption of new statutes and regulations, new interpretations of existing statutes and regulations or the enforcement of laws and regulations applicable to the financial markets or the financial services industry could result in a reduction in the amount of available credit or an increase in the cost of credit. Disruptions in the financial markets can also adversely affect the Company\u2019s lenders, insurers and counterparties, including vendors, retailers and film co-financing partners. The inability of the Company\u2019s counterparties to obtain capital on acceptable terms could impair their ability to perform under agreements with the Company and lead to negative effects on the Company, including business disruptions, decreased revenues, increases in bad debt expenses and, in the case of film co-financing partners, greater risk to the Company with respect to the performance of its feature films.\nThe Company faces risks relating to conducting business internationally that could adversely affect its businesses and operating results. It is important for the Company to achieve sufficient scale in key international territories in a cost-effective manner to be able to compete successfully in those territories. Failure to achieve sufficient scale could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. The increasing number of U.S. media companies focused on extending their global reach and the significant growth in the number of OTT services launched by international networks and distributors have intensified competition internationally, which could make it more difficult and expensive for the Company to achieve sufficient scale in key international territories. There are also risks inherent in international business operations, including:\n\u2022\nissues related to integrating and managing international operations and investments;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax developments;\n\u2022\nlack of sufficient protection for intellectual property in some countries;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on territorial content licensing;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange restrictions, export controls and currency devaluation risks in some foreign countries;\n\u2022\nthe existence in some countries of statutory shareholder minority rights and restrictions on foreign direct ownership;\n\u2022\nthe existence in some countries of regulatory or other restrictions that impede the ability of foreign companies to conduct business in such countries;\n\u2022\nthe existence of quotas and other content-related limitations or restrictions (e.g., government censorship);\n\u2022\nrestrictions on television advertising, marketing and network packaging;\n\u2022\nissues related to occupational safety and adherence to local labor laws and regulations;\n\u2022\npolitical or social unrest;\n\u2022\nhigher than anticipated costs of entry;\n\u2022\nthe presence of corruption in certain countries;\n\u2022\nthe absence of good diplomatic relations between the U.S. and certain countries; and\n\u2022\nthe potential for government appropriation of the Company\u2019s assets.\nOne or more of these factors could harm the Company\u2019s international operations or investments and its operating results.\nSome of the Company\u2019s operations are conducted in foreign currencies, and the value of these currencies fluctuates in relation to the U.S. dollar. Although the Company hedges a portion of its foreign currency exposures, significant fluctuations in exchange rates in the past have had, and in the future could have, an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations in a given period. As the Company expands its international operations, its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations will increase.\nIncreased piracy of the Company\u2019s content, products and other intellectual property may further decrease the revenues received from the legitimate sale, licensing and distribution of its content and adversely affect its business and profitability. The Company continues to be negatively affected by piracy, and an increase in the piracy of the Company\u2019s content, products and other intellectual property could reduce the revenues the Company earns from the legitimate sale, licensing and distribution of its content, products and other intellectual property. The risks relating to piracy continue to increase as technological developments have made it easier to access, reproduce, distribute and store high-quality unauthorized copies of content, such as increased broadband Internet speeds and penetration rates and increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission. Piracy is particularly prevalent in countries that lack effective copyright and other legal protections or enforcement measures, and illegitimate operators based in those parts of the world can attract users from anywhere in the world. The Company devotes substantial resources to protecting its content, products and intellectual property, but the Company\u2019s efforts to enforce its rights and combat piracy may not be successful.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results may suffer if it cannot continue to license and exploit its intellectual property rights. The Company relies on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, tradenames and other proprietary rights, as well as contractual arrangements, including licenses, to establish, maintain and protect its intellectual property rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which the Company does business. The Company may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which it does business or prevent others from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe on, or diminish the value of, the Company\u2019s trademarks and other proprietary rights. Companies that license the Company\u2019s intellectual property also may take actions that diminish the value of the Company\u2019s intellectual property or harm the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company\u2019s intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit it to take advantage of some business opportunities, such as new distribution platforms. As a result, the Company may be required to change its plans or acquire the necessary intellectual property rights, which could be costly.\nThe protection of the Company\u2019s intellectual property may require the Company to spend significant amounts of money. Further, the steps the Company takes to protect its intellectual property may not adequately protect its rights or prevent others from infringing or misappropriating its intellectual property rights. Any impairment of the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights, including due to changes in U.S. or foreign intellectual property laws or the absence of effective legal protections or enforcement measures, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company has been, and may be in the future, subject to claims that it infringed intellectual property rights of others, which could require the Company to change its business practices. Successful claims that the Company infringes on the intellectual property rights of others could require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, be prohibited preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or require the Company to change its business practices to stop the infringing use, which could limit its ability to compete effectively. Even if the Company believes a claim of intellectual property infringement is without merit, defending against the claim can be time-consuming and costly and divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from its businesses.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are subject to labor interruption. The Company and some of its suppliers and business partners retain the services of writers, directors, actors, announcers, athletes, technicians, trade employees and others involved in the development and production of its television programming, feature films and games who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements with the American Federation of Musicians, the International Alliance of Theatrical Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts, and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters expire in 2018. If negotiations to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements are not successful or become unproductive, the affected unions could take actions such as strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages. Strikes, work slowdowns, work stoppages or the possibility of such actions could result in delays in the production of the Company\u2019s television programming, feature films and games. The Company could also incur higher costs from such actions, new collective bargaining agreements or the renewal of collective bargaining agreements on less favorable terms. Many of the collective bargaining agreements that cover individuals providing services to the Company are industry-wide agreements, and the Company may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of these agreements. Union or labor disputes or player lock-outs relating to certain professional sports leagues may preclude the Company from producing and telecasting scheduled games or events and could negatively impact the Company\u2019s promotional and marketing opportunities. Depending on their duration, union or labor disputes or player lock-outs could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nService disruptions or failures of the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 information systems and networks as a result of computer viruses, misappropriation of data or other bad acts, natural disasters, extreme weather, accidental releases of information or other similar events, may disrupt the Company\u2019s businesses, damage its reputation or have a negative impact on its results of operations. Shutdowns or service disruptions of information systems or networks at the Company or vendors that provide information systems, networks or other services to the Company pose increasing risks. Such disruptions may be caused by third-party hacking of computers and systems; dissemination of computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software; denial of service attacks and other bad acts, as well as power outages, natural disasters, extreme weather, terrorist attacks, or other similar events. Shutdowns or disruption from such events could have an adverse impact on the Company and its customers, including degradation or disruption of service, loss of data, release or threatened release of data publicly, misuse or threatened misuse of data, and damage to equipment and data. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient to cover everything that could happen. Significant events could result in a disruption of the Company\u2019s operations, reduced revenues, the loss of or damage to the integrity of data used by management to make decisions and operate the Company\u2019s business, customer or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation or brands or a loss of customers. The Company may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate it for any losses associated with such events.\nThe Company is also subject to risks caused by the misappropriation, misuse, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of data maintained in the information systems and networks of the Company or its vendors, including sensitive or confidential personnel, customer or vendor data, business information or other sensitive or confidential information\n(including the Company\u2019s content). The number and sophistication of attempted and successful information security breaches have increased in recent years and, as a result, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase. The Company has experienced cybersecurity threats and breaches, none of which has been material. The Company expects that outside parties will continue to attempt to penetrate the Company\u2019s systems and those of its vendors or fraudulently induce employees or customers of the Company or employees of its vendors to disclose sensitive or confidential information to obtain or gain access to the Company\u2019s data, business information or other sensitive or confidential information. If a material breach of the Company\u2019s information systems or those of its vendors occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s information security measures could be harmed, the Company could lose customers and advertisers, the Company\u2019s revenues could be adversely affected and its reputation, brands and credibility could be damaged. In addition, if a material breach of its information systems occurs, the Company could be required to expend significant amounts of money and other resources to review data and systems to determine the extent of any breach, repair or replace information systems or networks or to comply with notification requirements. The Company also could be subject to actions by regulatory authorities and claims asserted in private litigation in the event of a breach of the information systems of the Company or its vendors.\nAlthough the Company develops and maintains information security practices and systems designed to prevent these events from occurring, the development and maintenance of these systems are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and tactics to overcome information security measures become more sophisticated. Despite the Company\u2019s efforts, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated entirely. Moreover, the techniques used by parties seeking to evade the information security practices and systems to infiltrate, disrupt, or for some other hostile purpose change rapidly and often are not recognized until launched against some targets. Information security risks will continue to increase, and the Company will need to expend additional resources to protect its information systems, networks, data, business information and other sensitive or confidential information as the Company distributes more of its content digitally, engages in more electronic transactions directly with consumers, acquires more consumer data, including information about consumers\u2019 viewing behavior, their credit card information and other personal data, increases the number of information technology systems used in its business operations, relies more on cloud-based services and information systems and increases its use of third-party service providers to perform information technology services.\nService disruptions or the failure of communications satellites or transmitter facilities relied on by the Company could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s revenues. Turner and Home Box Office rely on communications satellites and transmitter facilities to transmit their programming to affiliates and other distributors. Shutdowns of satellites and transmitter facilities or service disruptions pose significant risks to the Company\u2019s operations. Such disruptions may be caused by power outages, natural disasters, extreme weather, terrorist attacks, failures or impairments of communications satellites or on-ground uplinks or downlinks used to transmit programming, or other similar events. If a satellite is not able to transmit the Company\u2019s programming, the Company may not be able to secure an alternative communication satellite in a timely manner, because there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming. If such an event were to occur, there could be a disruption in the delivery of the Company\u2019s programming, which could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are subject to regulation in the U.S. and internationally, which could cause the Company to incur additional costs or liabilities or disrupt its business practices. The Company\u2019s businesses are subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Matters,\u201d for a description of significant U.S. federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, regulatory agency inquiries, rulemaking proceedings and other developments affecting the Company and its businesses. The Company could incur significant costs to comply with new laws or regulations or changes in interpretations of laws or regulations or substantial penalties or other liabilities if it fails to comply with them. Compliance with new laws or regulations also could cause the Company to change or limit its business practices in a manner that is adverse to its businesses. Trade agreements between the U.S. and other countries also impact the Company\u2019s businesses, including the distribution of the Company\u2019s content and the protection of its intellectual property. If there are changes in laws, regulations or trade agreements that provide protections that the Company relies on in conducting its businesses, these changes could subject the Company to greater risk of liability and could increase compliance costs or limit the Company\u2019s ability to operate certain lines of business.\nIf the separation of any of Time Inc., AOL Inc. (\u201cAOL\u201d) or Time Warner Cable Inc. (\u201cTWC\u201d) is determined to be taxable for income tax purposes, Time Warner and/or Time Warner\u2019s shareholders who received shares of Time Inc., AOL or TWC (as applicable) in connection with the respective spin-off of those companies could incur significant income tax liabilities. In connection with the separation from the Company of (i) Time Inc. in June 2014 and (ii) AOL in December\n2009, Time Warner received an opinion of counsel confirming that the applicable separation transaction should not result in the recognition, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, of gain or loss to Time Warner or its shareholders, except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares in such transaction. In connection with the separation of TWC from the Company in March 2009, Time Warner received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and opinions of counsel confirming that the TWC separation should not result in the recognition, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, of gain or loss to Time Warner or its shareholders, except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares. The IRS ruling and the opinions of counsel in connection with these transactions were based on, among other things, certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings that were made by Time Warner and Time Inc., AOL or TWC, as applicable, in connection with the applicable separation transaction. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, Time Warner and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the IRS ruling (in the case of the TWC separation transaction) or the opinions of counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Furthermore, opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS or state or local tax authorities or the courts, and a tax authority or court could determine that one or more of the separation transactions should be treated as a taxable transaction. Time Warner is entitled to indemnification from Time Inc., AOL and TWC for taxes resulting from the failure of the applicable separation transaction to qualify as tax-free as a result of (i) certain actions or failures to act by the former subsidiary or (ii) the failure of certain representations made by the former subsidiary to be true. However, if transaction taxes are incurred for other reasons, Time Warner would not be entitled to indemnification.\nThe proposed acquisition of Time Warner by AT&T may cause disruption in Time Warner\u2019s business. On October 22, 2016, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with AT&T, pursuant to which Time Warner will combine with AT&T in a stock-and-cash transaction. The Merger Agreement generally requires the Company to operate its business in the ordinary course pending consummation of the proposed merger and restricts the Company, without AT&T\u2019s consent, from taking certain specified actions until the merger is completed. These restrictions, which include prohibitions of purchases of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares of stock and increases in its dividend and limitations on the issuance of debt and certain acquisitions, among other items, may affect the Company\u2019s ability to execute its business strategies and attain its financial and other goals and may impact its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn connection with the pending merger, current and prospective employees of Time Warner have experienced or may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company following the merger, which may materially adversely affect the ability of Time Warner to attract and retain key personnel while the merger is pending. Key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company following the merger, and may depart prior to payments that may be due under the retention plan put in place in connection with the merger. Accordingly, Time Warner may not be able to attract and retain key employees to the same extent it has in the past.\nFurthermore, the proposed merger could cause disruptions to the Company\u2019s business or business relationships, which could have an adverse impact on its results of operations. Parties with which the Company has business relationships may experience uncertainty as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their existing business relationships with the Company. Parties with which the Company otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may hesitate or decline to enter into business relationships with the Company or may seek alternative relationships with third parties.\nThe pursuit of the merger and the preparation for the integration may place a significant burden on management, key personnel and other internal resources. The diversion of these individuals\u2019 attention from day-to-day business concerns could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe DOJ has filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking to enjoin the merger under a federal antitrust statute. The Company expects to incur significant costs and expenses in connection with the litigation. The litigation will require significant time commitments by certain members of management and key personnel, and the diversion of their attention from day-to-day business operations and the litigation-related costs could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results. The Company also has incurred and will continue to incur other significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed merger, and many of these fees and costs are payable regardless of whether or not the proposed merger is consummated.\nFailure to complete the merger in a timely manner or at all could negatively impact the market price of the Time Warner common stock, as well as the Company\u2019s future business and its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company had anticipated that the merger would close before year-end 2017, but it could not be certain when or if the conditions for the proposed merger would be satisfied or (if permissible under applicable law) waived. The merger cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied or (if permissible under applicable law) waived, including the receipt of required antitrust and other regulatory approvals. The DOJ lawsuit has delayed the consummation of the merger and, if the DOJ prevails, may prevent it. If the merger is not completed for any reason, Time Warner will remain an independent public company and the holders of Time Warner common stock will not receive any payment for their shares of Time Warner common stock in connection with the proposed merger and instead will continue to own their shares of Time Warner common stock.\nAdditionally, if the merger is not consummated in a timely manner or at all, Time Warner\u2019s ongoing business may be adversely affected as follows:\n\u2022\nTime Warner may experience negative reactions from financial markets and the stock price could decline;\n\u2022\nmanagement\u2019s focus on completing the merger and planning for the integration of Time Warner and AT&T over a significant time period would have limited its ability to pursue other opportunities, including alternative transactions to the merger, that could have been beneficial to Time Warner;\n\u2022\nTime Warner may not realize the expected benefits from the merger (or its ability to realize those benefits may be delayed), which may reduce or slow its efforts to innovate new offerings and impair its ability to compete in the rapidly-changing industries in which its businesses operate, particularly with respect to more targeted advertising offerings, new forms of content and new platforms for the delivery of video content directly to consumers, and with large technology companies, some of which have significant competitive advantages due to their large user bases, high consumer engagement and access to consumer data, that have become direct competitors;\n\u2022\nTime Warner may experience negative reactions from employees, customers, suppliers or other third parties; and\n\u2022\nthe costs of pursuing the merger may be higher than anticipated and would be borne entirely by Time Warner.\nIf the merger with AT&T is not completed, there can be no assurance that these risks will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect Time Warner\u2019s stock price, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nCompletion of the merger is subject to conditions and if these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the merger will not be completed. The obligations of AT&T and Time Warner to complete the merger are subject to satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including: (i) adoption of the Merger Agreement by Time Warner shareholders (which has been obtained), (ii) approval for the listing on the NYSE of the shares of AT&T common stock to be issued in the merger, upon official notice of issuance, (iii) expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period (or extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, (iv) if required in connection with the consummation of the merger, receipt of any necessary consents from the FCC, (v) receipt of consents from specified foreign regulators, (vi) if required in connection with the merger, receipt of consents from state public utility commissions, (vii) absence of any applicable law or order that prohibits completion of the merger, (viii) accuracy of the representations and warranties made in the Merger Agreement by the other party, subject to certain materiality qualifications, and (ix) performance in all material respects by the other party of the material obligations required to be performed by it at or prior to completion of the merger. In addition, AT&T\u2019s obligation to complete the merger is further subject to the governmental consents described in clauses (iii)-(vi) above having been received without the imposition of any regulatory conditions that, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably likely to have a \u201cregulatory material adverse effect,\u201d as defined in the Merger Agreement. Thus, the failure to satisfy the required conditions and, in particular, the DOJ lawsuit could further delay the completion of the merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Further, there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the merger will be satisfied or, where possible, waived or that the merger will be completed.\nIn order to complete the merger, AT&T and Time Warner must obtain certain governmental approvals, and if such approvals are not granted or are granted with conditions, completion of the merger may be jeopardized or the anticipated benefits of the merger could be reduced. AT&T and Time Warner have agreed in the Merger Agreement to use their reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to obtain the required governmental approvals or expiration or earlier termination of relevant waiting periods, as the case may be. In certain instances, the governmental authorities that provide these approvals have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations. As a condition to approving the merger or\nrelated transactions, these governmental authorities may impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of AT&T\u2019s business after completion of the merger. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, AT&T and its subsidiaries are required to take any and all actions necessary to obtain the consents, registrations, approvals, permits, waiting period expirations or authorizations imposed by governmental authorities required to consummate the merger (including accepting any conditions imposed by governmental authorities that would have a serious and significant adverse impact on the current or future business or operations of AT&T and its subsidiaries, including Time Warner and its subsidiaries), other than actions that would result in a \u201cregulatory material adverse effect\u201d as defined in the Merger Agreement.\nAs of the date of this report, the only significant remaining condition to Time Warner\u2019s and AT&T\u2019s obligations to complete the merger is the successful resolution of the DOJ lawsuit to enjoin the merger (either by Time Warner and AT&T prevailing in the lawsuit or through a negotiated settlement with the DOJ that contains terms that would not be reasonably likely to have a \u201cregulatory material adverse effect\u201d as defined in the Merger Agreement). The trial on the DOJ lawsuit is scheduled to start in mid-March 2018. The termination date in the Merger Agreement is April 22, 2018, as extended by the parties. AT&T and Time Warner each have waived, until June 21, 2018, its right to terminate the Merger Agreement if the merger has not been completed by April 22, 2018. Although Time Warner and AT&T believe that their case is strong under the law and that the Court will reject the DOJ\u2019s challenge to the merger, there can be no assurance that:\n\u2022\na decision will be rendered in the DOJ action by June 21, 2018;\n\u2022\nTime Warner and AT&T will prevail in the action after trial or upon appeal (or will be able to negotiate an acceptable settlement with the DOJ); or\n\u2022\nAT&T and Time Warner will agree to extend their mutual waiver of the right to terminate the Merger Agreement for a further period of time if the merger has not been completed by June 21, 2018.\nIn addition, even if Time Warner and AT&T prevail in the DOJ lawsuit or reach a settlement with the DOJ, it may have the effect of further delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger, or otherwise adversely affecting, including to a material extent, AT&T\u2019s businesses and results of operations after completion of the merger.", "PERMNO": 77418, "SIC": 4888, "TIC": "TWX"}
