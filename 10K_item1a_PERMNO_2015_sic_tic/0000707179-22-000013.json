{"cik": "707179", "company": "OLD NATIONAL BANCORP /IN/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect Old National\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, and access to liquidity, thereby affecting an investment in our Common Stock.\nAs a result of Old National entering into the merger agreement with First Midwest, certain risk factors have been identified:\nOld National has incurred and expects to incur substantial costs related to the merger with First Midwest (the \u201cmerger\u201d) and integration.\nOld National has incurred and expects to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the merger. These costs include legal, financial advisory, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees, retention, severance and employee benefit-related costs, public company filing fees and other regulatory fees, financial printing and other printing costs, closing, integration and other related costs. Some of these costs are payable by Old National regardless of whether or not the merger is completed.\nCombining Old National and First Midwest may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, and Old National may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nThe success of the merger will depend, in part, on the ability to realize the anticipated cost savings from combining the businesses of Old National and First Midwest. To realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from the merger, Old National and First Midwest must successfully integrate and combine their businesses in a manner that permits those cost savings to be realized without adversely affecting current revenues and future growth. If Old National and First Midwest are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual cost savings of the merger could be less than anticipated, and integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses.\nAn inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, levels of expenses and operating results of the combined company following the completion of the merger, which may adversely affect the value of the common stock of the combined company following the completion of the merger.\nOld National and First Midwest have operated and, until the completion of the merger, must continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the companies\u2019 ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger. Integration efforts between the companies may also divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on Old National during this transition period and on the combined company for an undetermined period after completion of the merger.\nFurthermore, the board of directors and executive leadership of the combined company will consist of former directors and executive officers from each of Old National and First Midwest. Combining the boards of directors and management teams of each company into a single board and a single management team could require the reconciliation of differing priorities and philosophies. With the increase in size of Old National\u2019s business following the merger, Old National\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon the ability of such management team to handle\npotential challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity.\nThe combined company may be unable to retain Old National and/or First Midwest personnel successfully after the merger is completed.\nThe success of the merger will depend in part on the combined company\u2019s ability to retain the talent and dedication of key employees currently employed by Old National and First Midwest. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with Old National or First Midwest, as applicable, while the merger is pending or with the combined company after the merger is consummated. If Old National and First Midwest are unable to retain key employees, including management, who are critical to the successful integration and future operations of the companies, Old National and First Midwest could face disruptions in their operations, loss of existing clients, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment costs. In addition, following the merger, if key employees terminate their employment, the combined company\u2019s business activities may be adversely affected, and management\u2019s attention may be diverted from successfully hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause the combined company\u2019s business to suffer. Old National and First Midwest also may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may delay and adversely affect the completion of the merger and the integration of the businesses of Old National and First Midwest.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, the business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, and results of operations of Old National. If the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic cause a continued or extended decline in the economic environment and the financial results of Old National, or the business operations of Old National are further disrupted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to complete the merger and integrate the businesses of Old National and First Midwest may also be delayed and adversely affected.\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively impact Old National.\nIf the merger is not completed for any reason, there may be various adverse consequences and Old National may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its clients and employees. For example, Old National\u2019s business may have been impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger. Additionally, if the merger agreement is terminated, the market price of Old National common stock could decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be beneficial and will be completed. Old National also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to proceedings commenced against Old National to perform its obligations under the merger agreement. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Old National may be required to pay a termination fee of $97 million to First Midwest.\nAdditionally, Old National has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as the costs and expenses of preparing, filing, printing, and mailing the joint proxy statement/prospectus, and all filing and other fees paid in connection with the merger. If the merger is not completed, Old National would have to pay these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger.\nOld National is subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and clients may have an adverse effect on Old National. These uncertainties may impair Old National\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed, and could cause clients and others that deal with Old National to seek to change existing business relationships with Old National. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, Old National has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course in all material respects and to refrain from taking certain actions that may adversely affect its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement on a timely basis without the consent of First Midwest. These restrictions may prevent Old National from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger.\nShareholder litigation related to the merger could prevent or delay the completion of the merger, result in the payment of damages or otherwise negatively impact the business and operations of Old National.\nTwo lawsuits and four demand letters relating to the disclosures contained in the joint proxy statement/prospectus distributed to Old National shareholders in connection with the merger have been filed or delivered by alleged stockholders of First Midwest. Among other remedies, these lawsuits and demand letters, and additional litigation or demand letters related to the merger in the future, may seek information, damages and/or to enjoin the merger. While Old National believes that the claims asserted in the civil litigation are without merit, if any plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting First Midwest or Old National from completing the merger or any other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, then such injunction may delay or prevent the effectiveness of the merger and could result in costs to Old National, including costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any shareholder lawsuits filed in connection with the merger. Further, such lawsuits and demand letters and the defense or settlement of claims contained in any such lawsuits or arising out of any demand letters may have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of Old National.\nThe merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be completed.\nThe merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger. Those conditions include: (i) approval by First Midwest stockholders of the First Midwest merger proposal and the approval by Old National shareholders of the Old National merger proposal at each company\u2019s respective special meeting held on September 15, 2021, which approvals were obtained; (ii) authorization for listing on NASDAQ of the shares of Old National common stock and new Old National preferred stock to be issued in the merger, subject to official notice of issuance; (iii) the receipt of required regulatory approvals, including the approval of the OCC and the Federal Reserve, both of which have been obtained; and (iv) the absence of any order, injunction, decree or other legal restraint preventing the completion of the merger, the subsequent merger of First Midwest Bank and Old National Bank (the \u201cbank merger\u201d) or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or making the completion of the merger, the bank merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement illegal. Each party\u2019s obligation to complete the merger is also subject to certain additional customary conditions, including (a) subject to applicable materiality standards, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party, (b) the performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the merger agreement, (c) the receipt by each party of an opinion from its counsel to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and (d) the execution and delivery of the bank merger agreement.\nThese conditions to the closing may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the merger may not be completed. In addition, the parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time, before or after the requisite shareholder and stockholder approvals, or Old National or First Midwest may elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain other circumstances.\nThe merger agreement limits Old National\u2019s abilities to pursue alternatives to the merger and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire Old National.\nThe merger agreement contains \u201cno shop\u201d covenants that restrict Old National\u2019s ability to, directly or indirectly, among other things, initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate, inquiries or proposals with respect to, or, subject to certain exceptions generally related to the exercise of fiduciary duties by Old National\u2019s board of directors, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or non-public information or data relating to, any alternative acquisition proposals. These provisions, which include a $97 million termination fee payable under certain circumstances, may discourage a potential third-party acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Old National from considering or proposing that acquisition.\nOld National\u2019s Enterprise Risk Management program is an enterprise-wide framework for identifying, managing, mitigating, monitoring, aggregating, and reporting risks. The following major risks identified by Old National\u2019s Enterprise Risk Management Program are described below: strategic, financial, and reputational; credit; market, interest rate, and liquidity; operational; and legal, regulatory, and compliance.\nStrategic, Financial, and Reputational Risks\nEconomic conditions have affected and could continue to adversely affect our revenues and profits.\nOld National\u2019s financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services that Old National offers, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where Old National operates and in the United States as a whole. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; natural disasters; terrorist acts; or a combination of these or other factors.\nAn economic downturn, sustained high unemployment levels, or stock market volatility may negatively impact our operating results and have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, increasing the risk of loan defaults and losses. If the forecasts of economic conditions and other economic predictions are not accurate, we may face challenges in accurately estimating the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. Expectations of negative market and economic conditions will be reflected in the allowances for credit losses for loans and debt securities to the estimated extent they will impact the credit losses of new and existing loans and debt securities over their remaining lives. The provision for credit losses will report the entire increased credit loss expectations over the remaining lives of the loans and debt securities in the period in which the change in expectation arises. Further, because of the impact of such increased credit losses on earnings and capital, our ability to make loans and pay dividends may be substantially diminished.\nChanges in economic or political conditions could adversely affect Old National\u2019s earnings, if the ability of Old National\u2019s borrowers to repay loans, or the value of the collateral securing such loans, declines.\nOld National\u2019s success depends, to a certain extent, upon economic or political conditions, local and national, as well as governmental monetary policies. Conditions such as recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, inflation, money supply, and other factors beyond Old National\u2019s control may adversely affect its asset quality, deposit levels, and loan demand and, therefore, Old National\u2019s earnings. Because Old National has a significant amount of commercial real estate loans, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral. Adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of Old National\u2019s borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on Old National\u2019s earnings. In addition, substantially all of Old National\u2019s loans are to individuals and businesses in Old National\u2019s market area. Consequently, any economic decline in Old National\u2019s primary market areas, which include Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, could have an adverse impact on Old National\u2019s earnings.\nOld National\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, loans, asset quality, capital, and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively affect the Company will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted and many of which are outside of the Company\u2019s control. These future developments may include the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of new variants of COVID-19, the possibility of future resurgences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the continued effectiveness of the Company\u2019s business continuity plan including work-from-home arrangements and staffing at branches and certain other facilities, the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s employees, clients, counterparties and service providers, as well as on other market participants, actions taken, or that may yet be taken, by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effectiveness and public acceptance of vaccines for COVID-19.\nAlthough financial markets have largely rebounded from the significant declines that occurred earlier in the pandemic and global economic conditions showed signs of improvement during the second half of 2020 and throughout 2021, many of the circumstances that arose or became more pronounced after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic persist, including:\n\u2022supply chain issues remain unresolved for longer than anticipated and decreased consumer and business confidence and economic activity, leading to certain lower loan demand and an increased risk of loan delinquencies, defaults, and foreclosures;\n\u2022ratings downgrades, credit deterioration and defaults in many industries, including, but not limited to, recreation and entertainment, hotels, and restaurants, as well as across consumer unsecured installment loans;\n\u2022a decrease in the rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities, which may lead to further decreased net interest income;\n\u2022volatility in financial and capital markets, interest rates, and exchange rates;\n\u2022declines in collateral values;\n\u2022increased demands on capital and liquidity;\n\u2022a reduction in the value of the assets that the Company manages or otherwise administers or services for others, affecting related fee income and demand for the Company\u2019s services;\n\u2022heightened cybersecurity, information security, and operational risks as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption resulting from the pandemic given increased online and remote activity, including as a result of work-from-home arrangements;\n\u2022disruptions to business operations experienced by counterparties and service providers;\n\u2022increased risk of business disruption if our employees are unable to work effectively because of illness, quarantines, government actions, failures in systems or technology that disrupt work-from-home arrangements, or other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022decreased demands for our products and services.\nAs a result, our credit, operational, and certain other risks are generally expected to remain elevated until the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. Depending on the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic going forward, the conditions noted above could continue for an extended period and these or other adverse developments may occur or reoccur.\nGovernmental authorities have taken unprecedented measures both to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and to provide economic assistance to individuals and businesses, stabilize the markets, and support economic growth. The Company also faces an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions governmental authorities take in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, various government programs such as the U.S. Small Business Administration\u2019s PPP are complex and our participation may lead to litigation and governmental, regulatory and third party scrutiny, negative publicity, and damage to our reputation.\nThe length of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efficacy of the extraordinary measures being put in place to address it are unknown. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the economic recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has experienced and may continue to experience draws on lines of credit, reduced net interest income and net interest margin, reduced revenues in its fee-based businesses, and increased client defaults, including defaults on unsecured loans, resulting in overall declines in credit quality and higher credit loss expense. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy may continue to experience a recession, and the Company anticipates that its businesses could be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged recession. To the extent the pandemic adversely affects the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, loans, asset quality, or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of the Form 10-K.\nAcquisitions may not produce revenue enhancements or cost savings at levels or within timeframes originally anticipated and may result in unforeseen integration difficulties and dilution to existing shareholder value.\nWe have acquired, and expect to continue to acquire, other financial institutions or parts of those institutions in the future, and we may engage in de novo banking center expansion. We may also consider and enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services.\nWe may incur substantial costs to expand, and we can give no assurance such expansion will result in the levels of profits we seek or expect. There can be no assurance that integration efforts for any mergers or acquisitions will be successful or that, after giving effect to the merger or acquisition, we will achieve profits comparable to, or better than, our historical experience. Also, we may issue equity securities in connection with acquisitions, which could cause ownership and economic dilution to our current shareholders.\nAcquisitions and mergers involve a number of expenses and risks, including:\n\u2022the time and costs associated with identifying potential new markets, as well as acquisition and merger targets;\n\u2022the accuracy of the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management, and market risks with respect to the target institution;\n\u2022the time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management, and opening new offices, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u2022our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders;\n\u2022the diversion of our management\u2019s attention to the negotiation and execution of a transaction, and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combined businesses;\n\u2022entry into new markets where we lack experience;\n\u2022the introduction of new products and services into our business;\n\u2022the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short-term effects on our results of operations;\n\u2022closing delays and increased expenses related to the resolution of lawsuits filed by shareholders of target institutions; and\n\u2022the risk of loss of key employees and clients.\nOld National must generally receive federal regulatory approval before it can acquire a bank or bank holding company. Old National cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory\napprovals will be granted. Old National may be required to sell banks or banking centers as a condition to receiving regulatory approval.\nFuture acquisitions could be material to Old National and it may issue additional shares of stock to pay for those acquisitions, which would dilute current shareholders\u2019 ownership interests.\nOur accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on analytical and forecasting models.\nThe processes that we use to estimate probable credit losses and to measure the fair value of assets carried on the balance sheet at fair value, as well as the processes used to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, depend upon the use of analytical and forecasting models. These models are complex and reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances and require us to make judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Different assumptions could have resulted in significant changes in valuation, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOld National operates in an extremely competitive market, and Old National\u2019s business will suffer if Old National is unable to compete effectively.\nIn our market area, Old National encounters significant competition from other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, FinTech companies, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market mutual funds, and other financial intermediaries. Our competitors may have substantially greater resources and lending limits than Old National does and may offer services that Old National does not or cannot provide. Some of our nonfinancial institution competitors may have fewer regulatory constraints, broader geographic service areas, and, in some cases, lower cost structures. Old National\u2019s profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area.\nOur business could suffer if we fail to attract and retain skilled people.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best employees in most of the activities we engage in can be intense. We may not be able to hire the best people for key\nroles or retain them. In addition, the transition to increased work-from-home arrangements, which is likely to survive the COVID-19 pandemic for many companies, may exacerbate the challenges of attracting and retaining talented and diverse employees as job markets may be less constrained by physical geography. Our current or future approach to in-office and work-from-home arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of our current or prospective employees or may not be perceived as favorable as compared to the arrangements offered by competitors, which could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees. The loss of any of our key personnel or an inability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to pay dividends in the future in accordance with past practice.\nOld National has traditionally paid a quarterly dividend to its common shareholders. The payment of dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. Any payment of dividends in the future will depend, in large part, on Old National\u2019s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.\nOld National is an entity separate and distinct from Old National Bank. Old National Bank conducts most of our operations and Old National depends upon dividends from Old National Bank to service its debt and to pay dividends to Old National\u2019s shareholders. The availability of dividends from Old National Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition including liquidity and capital adequacy of Old National Bank and other factors, that the OCC could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments is an unsafe or unsound practice. In addition, the payment of dividends by our other subsidiaries is also subject to the laws of the subsidiary\u2019s state of incorporation, and regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to such subsidiaries. At December 31, 2021, Old National Bank could pay dividends of $268.1 million without prior regulatory approval. In the event that Old National Bank was unable to pay dividends to us, we in turn would likely have to reduce or stop paying dividends on our Common Stock. Our failure to pay dividends on our Common Stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock. See \u201cBusiness - Supervision and Regulation - Dividend Limitations\u201d and Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOld National may not realize the expected benefits of its strategic imperatives.\nOld National\u2019s ability to compete depends on a number of factors, including, among others, its ability to develop and successfully execute strategic plans and imperatives. Our strategic priorities include consistent quality earnings, enhanced management discipline, and strong risk management; greater confidence in decision making and appropriate levels of risk taking; fewer operational surprises, disruptions, and losses; improved operational effectiveness and efficiency; more effective deployment of resources; and increased awareness and involvement in the achievement of strategic goals. Our inability to execute on or achieve the anticipated outcomes of our strategic priorities may affect how the market perceives us and could impede our growth and profitability.\nClimate change could have a material negative impact on the Company and clients.\nThe Company\u2019s business, as well as the operations and activities of our clients, could be negatively impacted by climate change. Climate change presents both immediate and long-term risks to the Company and its clients, and these risks are expected to increase over time. Climate change presents multi-faceted risks, including: operational risk from the physical effects of climate events on the Company and its clients\u2019 facilities and other assets; credit risk from borrowers with significant exposure to climate risk; transition risks associated with the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy; and reputational risk from stakeholder concerns about our practices related to climate change, the Company\u2019s carbon footprint, and the Company\u2019s business relationships with clients who operate in carbon-intensive industries.\nFederal and state banking regulators and supervisory authorities, investors, and other stakeholders have increasingly viewed financial institutions as important in helping to address the risks related to climate change both directly and with respect to their clients, which may result in financial institutions coming under increased pressure regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending and investment activities. Given that climate change could impose systemic risks upon the financial sector, either via disruptions in economic activity resulting from the physical impacts of climate change or changes in policies as the economy transitions to a less carbon-intensive environment, the Company may face regulatory risk of increasing focus on the Company\u2019s resilience to climate-related risks, including in the context of stress testing for various climate stress scenarios. Ongoing\nlegislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory, compliance, credit, and reputational risks and costs.\nWith the increased importance and focus on climate change, we are making efforts to enhance our governance of climate change-related risks and integrate climate considerations into our risk governance framework. Nonetheless, the risks associated with climate change are rapidly changing and evolving in an escalating fashion, making them difficult to assess due to limited data and other uncertainties. We could experience increased expenses resulting from strategic planning, litigation, and technology and market changes, and reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny, and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence due to our response to climate change and our climate change strategy, which, in turn, could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nCredit Risk\nIf Old National\u2019s actual credit losses for loans or debt securities exceed Old National\u2019s allowance for credit losses for loans and debt securities, Old National\u2019s net income will decrease. Also, future additions to Old National\u2019s allowance for credit losses will reduce Old National\u2019s future earnings.\nOld National\u2019s business depends on the creditworthiness of our clients. As with most financial institutions, we maintain allowances for credit losses for loans and debt securities to provide for defaults and nonperformance, which represent an estimate of expected losses over the remaining contractual lives of the loan and debt security portfolios. This estimate is the result of our continuing evaluation of specific credit risks and loss experience, current loan and debt security portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions, industry concentrations, reasonable and supportable forecasts for future conditions, and other factors that may indicate losses. The determination of the appropriate levels of the allowances for loan and debt security credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Generally, our nonperforming loans and other real estate owned reflect operating difficulties of individual borrowers and weaknesses in the economies of the markets we serve. The allowances may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and future allowance for credit losses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOld National\u2019s loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss.\nOld National Bank originates commercial real estate loans, commercial loans, agricultural real estate loans, agricultural loans, consumer loans, and residential real estate loans primarily within Old National\u2019s market areas. Commercial real estate, commercial, consumer, and agricultural real estate and operating loans may expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate. These loans also have greater credit risk than residential real estate for the following reasons:\n\u2022Commercial Real Estate Loans. Repayment is dependent upon income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service.\n\u2022Commercial Loans. Repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower\u2019s business.\n\u2022Consumer Loans. Consumer loans (such as personal lines of credit) are collateralized, if at all, with assets that may not provide an adequate source of payment of the loan due to depreciation, damage, or loss.\n\u2022Agricultural Loans. Repayment is dependent upon the successful operation of the business, which is greatly dependent on many things outside the control of either Old National Bank or the borrowers. These factors include weather, input costs, commodity and land prices, and interest rates.\nIf Old National forecloses on collateral real property, Old National may be subject to the increased costs associated with the ownership of real property, resulting in reduced revenues.\nOld National may have to foreclose on collateral real property to protect Old National\u2019s investment and may thereafter own and operate such property, in which case Old National will be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. The amount that Old National, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of Old National\u2019s control, including, but not limited to: (i) general or local economic conditions; (ii) neighborhood values; (iii) interest rates; (iv) real estate tax rates; (v) operating expenses of the mortgaged properties; (vi) environmental remediation liabilities; (vii) ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties; (viii) zoning laws; (ix) governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies; and (x) acts\nof God. Certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs, may adversely affect the income from the real estate. Therefore, the cost of operating real property may exceed the income earned from such property, and Old National may have to advance funds in order to protect Old National\u2019s investment or dispose of the real property at a loss. The foregoing expenditures and costs could adversely affect Old National\u2019s ability to generate revenues, resulting in reduced levels of profitability.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect Old National.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. Old National has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and Old National and certain of its subsidiaries routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutions. Many of these transactions expose Old National to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty. In addition, Old National\u2019s credit risk may be affected when collateral is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure. These types of losses could materially adversely affect Old National\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nMarket, Interest Rate, and Liquidity Risks\nThe price of Old National\u2019s Common Stock may be volatile, which may result in losses for investors.\nGeneral market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of Old National\u2019s Common Stock. In addition, the following factors may cause the market price for shares of Old National\u2019s Common Stock to fluctuate:\n\u2022announcements of developments related to Old National\u2019s business;\n\u2022fluctuations in Old National\u2019s results of operations;\n\u2022sales or purchases of substantial amounts of Old National\u2019s securities in the marketplace;\n\u2022general conditions in Old National\u2019s banking niche or the global or national economy;\n\u2022a shortfall or excess in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u2022changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections; and\n\u2022Old National\u2019s announcement of new acquisitions or other projects.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect Old National\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nOld National\u2019s earnings depend substantially on Old National\u2019s interest rate spread, which is the difference between (i) the rates Old National earns on loans, securities, and other earning assets and (ii) the interest rates Old National pays on deposits and other borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond Old National\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. If market interest rates rise, Old National will have competitive pressure to increase the rates that Old National pays on deposits, which could result in a decrease of Old National\u2019s net interest income. If market interest rates decline, Old National could experience fixed-rate loan prepayments and higher investment portfolio cash flows, resulting in a lower yield on earning assets. Old National\u2019s earnings can also be impacted by the spread between short-term and long-term market interest rates.\nChanges in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR and other benchmark rates are determined could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and certain of the products that we offer, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as LIBOR, or to an index, currency, basket, or other financial metric. LIBOR and certain other benchmark rates are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) announced that the FCA intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. However, the administrator of LIBOR has proposed to extend publication of the most commonly used U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings until June 30, 2023 and will cease publishing other LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021. The U.S. federal banking agencies have issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using the U.S. Dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in \u201cnew\u201d contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021. It is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, which rate or rates may\nbecome accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments.\nRegulators, industry groups, and certain committees (e.g., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have, among other things, published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as the recommended alternative to U.S. Dollar LIBOR), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.\nThe discontinuation of LIBOR, changes in LIBOR, or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of LIBOR as a benchmark could result in changes to our risk exposures (for example, if the anticipated discontinuation of LIBOR adversely affects the availability or cost of floating-rate funding and, therefore, our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates) or otherwise result in losses on a product or having to pay more or receive less on securities that we own or have issued. In addition, such uncertainty could result in pricing volatility and increased capital requirements, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, and compliance, legal and operational costs and risks associated with client disclosures, discretionary actions taken or negotiation of fallback provisions, systems disruption, business continuity, and model disruption.\nOur wholesale funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits or support our future growth.\nAs a part of our liquidity management, we use a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments. These sources include brokered deposits, repurchase agreements, and federal funds purchased. Negative operating results or changes in industry conditions could lead to an inability to replace these additional funding sources at maturity. Our financial flexibility could be constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. Finally, if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively affected.\nA reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our business and/or the holders of our securities.\nThe credit rating agencies rating our indebtedness regularly evaluate Old National and Old National Bank. Credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and the economy and changes in rating methodologies. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings. A downgrade of the credit ratings of Old National or Old National Bank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital, significantly increase our cost of funds, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or purchase our securities. This could affect our growth, profitability, and financial condition, including liquidity.\nOperational Risks\nA failure or breach, including cyber-attacks, of our operational or security systems could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, and create significant financial and legal exposure.\nAlthough we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly upgrade our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks, and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information belonging to us and our clients, there is no assurance that our security measures will provide absolute security. Further, to access our products and services our clients may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems. In fact, many other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks, and other means. Certain financial institutions in the United States have also experienced attacks from technically sophisticated and well-resourced third parties that were intended to disrupt normal business activities by making internet banking systems\ninaccessible to clients for extended periods. These \u201cdenial-of-service\u201d attacks typically do not breach data security systems, but require substantial resources to defend, and may affect client satisfaction and behavior.\nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including persons who are involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, clients, or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. We have implemented employee and client awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity risks. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile payments and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.\nIf our security systems were penetrated or circumvented, it could cause serious negative consequences for us, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of our confidential information or that of our clients, or damage our computers or systems and those of our clients and counterparties, and could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our clients, loss of confidence in our security measures, client dissatisfaction, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe Company is also subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection and privacy of the information of clients, employees and others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the Company to liability and/or reputational damage.\nWe rely on third party vendors, which could expose Old National to additional cybersecurity risks.\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure, including certain data processing and information services. Third parties may transmit confidential, propriety information on our behalf. Although we require third party providers to maintain certain levels of information security, such providers may remain vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious attacks that could ultimately compromise sensitive information. While we may contractually limit our liability in connection with attacks against third party providers, Old National remains exposed to the risk of loss associated with such vendors.\nIn addition, a number of our vendors are large national entities with dominant market presence in their respective fields. Their services could prove difficult to replace in a timely manner if a failure or other service interruption were to occur. Failures of certain vendors to provide contracted services could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and cause us to incur significant expense.\nFailure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect Old National\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve clients and to reduce costs. Old National\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address client needs by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in Old National\u2019s operations. Old National may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its clients. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could negatively affect Old National\u2019s growth, revenue, and profit.\nUpgrading the Company\u2019s computer systems, software, and networks subjects the Company to the risk of disruptions, failures, or delays due to the complexity and interconnectedness of the Company\u2019s computer systems, software, and networks. The failure to properly upgrade or maintain these computer systems, software, and networks could result in greater susceptibility to cyber-attacks, particularly in light of the greater frequency and severity of attacks in recent years, as well as the growing prevalence of supply chain attacks affecting software and information service providers. Failures related to upgrades and maintenance also increase risks related to unauthorized access and misuse. There can be no assurance that any such disruptions, failures, or delays will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed.\nChanges in consumer use of banks and changes in consumer spending and savings habits could adversely affect Old National\u2019s financial results.\nTechnology and other changes now allow many clients to complete financial transactions without using banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank. This process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of client deposits and income generated from those deposits. In addition, changes in consumer spending and savings habits could adversely affect Old National\u2019s operations, and Old National may be unable to timely develop competitive new products and services in response to these changes.\nOld National\u2019s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, and Old National\u2019s methods of reducing risk exposure may not be effective.\nOld National regularly reviews and updates its internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Old National also maintains an Enterprise Risk Management program designed to identify, manage, mitigate, monitor, aggregate, and report risks. Any system of controls and any system to reduce risk exposure, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Additionally, instruments, systems, and strategies used to hedge or otherwise manage exposure to various types of market compliance, credit, liquidity, operational, and business risks and enterprise-wide risk could be less effective than anticipated. As a result, Old National may not be able to effectively mitigate its risk exposures in particular market environments or against particular types of risk.\nLegal, Regulatory, and Compliance Risks\nWe have risk related to legal proceedings.\nWe are involved in judicial, regulatory, and arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising from our business activities and fiduciary responsibilities. We establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We may still incur legal costs for a matter even if we have not established a reserve. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a legal claim may be substantially higher than any amounts reserved for that matter. The ultimate resolution of a pending or future legal proceeding, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOld National operates in a highly regulated environment, and changes in laws and regulations to which Old National is subject may adversely affect Old National\u2019s results of operations.\nOld National operates in a highly regulated environment and is subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by, among others, the OCC, the FDIC, the CFPB, the Federal Reserve, and the State of Indiana. Such regulation and supervision is primarily intended for the protection of the depositors and federal deposit insurance funds. In addition, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the \u201cU.S. Treasury\u201d) has certain supervisory and oversight duties and responsibilities. See \u201cBusiness - Supervision and Regulation\u201d herein. Applicable laws and regulations may change, and such changes may adversely affect Old National\u2019s business. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, mandated the most wide-ranging overhaul of financial industry regulation in decades. This legislation, among other things, weakened federal preemption of state consumer protection laws and established the CFPB with broad authority to administer and enforce a new federal regulatory framework of consumer financial regulation, including consumer mortgage banking. The scope and impact of many of the Dodd-Frank Act provisions were determined and issued over time. The impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on Old National has been substantial. Provisions in the legislation that affect the payment of interest on demand deposits and collection of interchange fees increased the costs associated with certain deposits and placed limitations on certain revenues those deposits generate. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act required Old National to change certain of its business practices, intensified the regulatory supervision of Old National and the financial services industry generally, increased Old National\u2019s capital requirements, and imposed additional assessments and costs on Old National. Requirements to maintain higher levels of capital or liquidity to address potential adverse stress scenarios could adversely impact the Company\u2019s net income.\nRegulatory authorities also have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including but not limited to the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets by the institution, the adequacy of an institution\u2019s Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering program management, and the adequacy of an institution\u2019s allowance for credit losses for loans. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of restrictions on activities, regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, including but not limited to changes in the regulations governing institutions, could have a material impact on Old National and its operations.\nChanges in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations could materially affect how Old National reports its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FASB periodically changes the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of Old National\u2019s financial statements. Additionally, those bodies that establish and/or interpret the financial accounting and reporting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations on how these standards should be applied. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how Old National records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, Old National could be required to retroactively apply a new or revised standard, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results.\nIf Old National fails to meet regulatory capital requirements which may require heightened capital levels, we may be forced to raise capital or sell assets.\nOld National is subject to regulations that require us to satisfy certain capital ratios, such as the ratio of our Tier 1 capital to our risk-based assets. Both the Dodd-Frank Act, which reformed the regulation of financial institutions in a comprehensive manner, and the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, which increased both the amount and quality of capital that financial institutions must hold, impact our capital requirements. If we are unable to satisfy these heightened regulatory capital requirements, due to a decline in the value of our loan portfolio or otherwise, we will be required to improve such capital ratios by either raising additional capital or by disposing of assets. If we choose to dispose of assets, we cannot be certain that we will be able to do so at prices that we believe to be appropriate, and our future operating results could be negatively affected. If we choose to raise additional capital, we may accomplish this by selling additional shares of Common Stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, which could significantly dilute the ownership percentage of holders of our Common Stock and cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline. Additionally, events or circumstances in the capital markets generally may increase our capital costs and impair our ability to raise capital at any given time. See \u201cBusiness - Supervision and Regulation\u201d herein for further discussion on the Basel III regulatory capital reforms.\nOur earnings could be adversely impacted by incidences of fraud and compliance failure.\nFinancial institutions are inherently exposed to fraud risk. A fraud can be perpetrated by a client of Old National, an employee, a vendor, or members of the general public. We are most subject to fraud and compliance risk in connection with the origination of loans, ACH transactions, wire transactions, ATM transactions, and checking transactions. Our largest fraud risk, associated with the origination of loans, includes the intentional misstatement of information in property appraisals or other underwriting documentation provided to us by third parties. Compliance risk is the risk that loans are not originated in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our standards. There can be no assurance that we can prevent or detect acts of fraud or violation of law or our compliance standards by the third parties that we deal with. Repeated incidences of fraud or compliance failures would adversely impact the performance of our loan portfolio.", "PERMNO": 12068, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "ONB"}
