RISK FACTORS.\nWe operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks, some of which are beyond our control. The following discussion highlights some of the risks which may affect future operating results. These are the risks and uncertainties we believe are most important for you to consider, but the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, which we currently deem immaterial, or which are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or uncertainties occurs, continues, or worsens, our business, financial condition, and operating results would likely suffer. You should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have grown significantly in recent years, and our delinquency and charge-off rates and overall results of operations may be adversely affected if we do not manage our growth effectively.\nWe have experienced substantial growth in recent years, opening or acquiring 43 branches in 2013, 36 in 2014, and 31 in 2015, and we intend to continue our growth strategy in the future. As we increase the number of branches we operate, we will be required to find new, or relocate existing, employees to operate our branches and allocate resources to train and supervise those employees. The success of a branch depends significantly on the manager overseeing its operations and on our ability to enforce our underwriting standards and implement controls over branch operations. Recruiting suitable managers for new branches can be challenging, particularly in remote areas and in areas where we face significant competition. Furthermore, the annual turnover among our branch managers was approximately 26% in 2014 and 25% in 2015, and turnover rates of managers in our new branches may be similar or higher. Increasing the number of branches that we operate may divide the attention of our senior management or strain our ability to adapt our infrastructure and systems to accommodate our growth. If we are unable to promote, relocate, or recruit suitable managers, oversee their activities effectively, and otherwise appropriately and effectively staff our branches, our delinquency and charge-off rates may increase and our overall results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nWe face significant risks in implementing our growth strategy, some of which are outside of our control.\nWe intend to continue our growth strategy, which is based on opening and acquiring branches in existing and new markets and introducing new products and channels. Our ability to execute this growth strategy is subject to significant risks, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe inherent uncertainty regarding general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe prevailing laws and regulatory environment of each state in which we operate or seek to operate and, to the extent applicable, federal laws and regulations, which are subject to change at any time;\n\u2022\nthe degree of competition in new markets and its effect on our ability to attract new customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to identify attractive locations for new branches;\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit qualified personnel, particularly in remote areas and in areas where we face a great deal of competition; and\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain adequate financing for our expansion plans.\nFor example, North Carolina requires a \u201cneeds and convenience\u201d assessment of a new lending license and location prior to the granting of the license, which adds time and expense to opening new locations. In addition, certain states into which we may expand limit the number of lending licenses granted. There can be no assurance that if we apply for a license for a new branch, whether in one of the states where we currently operate or in a\nstate into which we would like to expand, we would be granted a license to operate. We also cannot be certain that any such license, even if granted, would be obtained in a timely manner or without burdensome conditions or limitations. In addition, we may not be able to obtain and maintain the regulatory approvals, government permits, or licenses that may be required.\nWe face strong direct and indirect competition.\nThe consumer finance industry is highly competitive, and the barriers to entry for new competitors are relatively low in the markets in which we operate. We compete for customers, locations, employees, and other important aspects of our business with many other local, regional, national, and international financial institutions, many of which have greater financial resources than we do.\nOur installment loan operations compete with other installment lenders as well as with alternative financial services providers (such as payday and title lenders, check advance companies, and pawnshops), online or peer-to-peer lenders, issuers of non-prime credit cards, and other competitors. We believe that future regulatory developments in the consumer finance industry may cause lenders that currently focus on alternative financial services to begin to offer installment loans. In addition, if companies in the installment loan business attempt to provide more attractive loan terms than is standard across the industry, we may lose customers to those competitors. In installment loans, we compete primarily on the basis of price, breadth of loan product offerings, flexibility of loan terms offered, and the quality of customer service provided.\nOur automobile purchase loan operations compete with numerous financial services providers, including non-prime auto lenders, dealers that provide financing, captive finance companies owned by automobile manufacturers, banks, and credit unions. Our retail purchase loan operations compete with non-prime retail lenders, store and third-party credit cards, prime lending sources, rent-to-own finance providers, and other competitors. For automobile purchase loans and retail purchase loans, we compete primarily on the basis of interest rates charged, the quality of credit accepted, the flexibility of loan terms offered, the speed of approval, and the quality of customer service provided.\nIf we fail to compete successfully, we could face lower sales and may decide or be compelled to materially alter our lending terms to our customers, which could result in decreased profitability.\nOur business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making, continuing, and growing relationships with automobile dealers and retailers, or if the dealers and retailers with whom we have relationships experience a decline or disruption in their sales volumes.\nOur automobile purchase loans and retail purchase loans are reliant on our relationships with automobile dealers and retailers. In particular, our automobile purchase loan operations depend in large part upon our ability to establish and maintain relationships with reputable dealers who direct customers to our branches or originate loans at the point of sale, which we subsequently purchase. Although we have relationships with certain automobile dealers, none of our relationships are exclusive, some of them are newly established, and they may be terminated at any time. If, due to economic reasons, competition, or otherwise, we are unable to establish and maintain relationships with reputable dealers, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur retail purchase loan business model is based on our ability to enter into agreements with individual retailers to provide financing to customers in their stores. If a competitor were to offer better service or more attractive loan products to our retailer partners, it is possible that our retail partners would terminate their relationships with us. If we are unable to continue to grow our existing relationships and develop new relationships, our results of operations, financial condition, and ability to continue to expand could be adversely affected.\nEven with good relationships with automobile dealers and retailers, our ability to originate automobile purchase loans and retail purchase loans is dependent, in large part, on the underlying consumer demand for automobiles and retail goods. Automobile and retail sales are subject to fluctuation as a result of general economic trends and other factors. If sales volumes at the automobile dealerships and retailers with whom we have relationships decrease in the future as a result of general economic trends or due to any other factors, we may experience a corresponding decrease in the volume of such loans that we originate. In such circumstances, we may experience an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nA substantial majority of our revenue is generated by our branches in South Carolina, Texas, and North Carolina.\nOur branches in South Carolina, Texas, and North Carolina accounted for 27%, 30%, and 13%, respectively, of our revenue in 2015. Furthermore, all of our operations are in five Southeastern, one mid-Atlantic, and three Southwestern states. As a result, we are highly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in those areas. The unemployment rates in some states in our footprint are among the highest in the country. High unemployment rates may reduce the number of qualified borrowers to whom we will extend loans, which would result in reduced loan originations. Adverse economic conditions may increase delinquencies and charge-offs and decrease our overall loan portfolio quality. If any of the adverse regulatory or legislative events described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section were to occur in South Carolina, Texas, or North Carolina, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, if interest rates in South Carolina, which currently are not capped, were to be capped, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nRegular turnover among our managers and other employees at our branches makes it more difficult for us to operate our branches and increases our costs of operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur workforce is comprised primarily of employees who work on an hourly basis. In certain areas where we operate, there is significant competition for employees. In the past, we have lost employees and candidates to competitors who have been willing to pay higher compensation than we pay. Our ability to continue to expand our operations depends on our ability to attract, train, and retain a large and growing number of qualified employees. The turnover among all of our branch employees was approximately 38% in 2013, 44% in 2014, and 44% in 2015. This turnover increases our cost of operations and makes it more difficult to operate our branches. Our customer service representative and assistant manager roles have historically experienced high turnover. We may not be able to retain and cultivate personnel at these ranks for future promotion to branch manager. If our employee turnover rates increase above historical levels or if unanticipated problems arise from our high employee turnover and we are unable to readily replace such employees, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and ability to continue to expand could be adversely affected.\nThe departure, transition, or replacement of key personnel could significantly impact the results of our operations. If we cannot continue to hire and retain high quality employees, our business and financial results may be negatively affected.\nOur future success significantly depends on the continued service and performance of our key management personnel. Competition for these employees is intense. Our operating results could be adversely affected by higher employee turnover or increased salary and benefit costs. Like most businesses, our employees are important to our success and we are dependent in part on our ability to retain the services of our key management, operational, finance, and administrative personnel. We have built our business on a set of core values, and we attempt to hire employees who are committed to these values. We want to hire and retain employees who will fit our culture of providing exceptional service to our customers. In order to compete and to continue to grow, we must attract, retain, and motivate employees, including those in executive, senior management, and operational positions. As our employees gain experience and develop their knowledge and skills, they become highly desired by other businesses. Therefore, to retain our employees, we must provide a\nsatisfying work environment and competitive compensation and benefits. If costs to retain our skilled employees increase, then our business and financial results may be negatively affected.\nOur continued growth is also dependent, in part, on the skills, experience, and efforts of our senior management, including but not limited to, Michael R. Dunn, our Chief Executive Officer, and Jody L. Anderson, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Since late 2014, we have experienced departures of members of our senior management, including C. Glynn Quattlebaum, who was a co-founder, President, and Chief Operating Officer and served on our Board of Directors, Thomas F. Fortin, who was our Chief Executive Officer and served on our Board of Directors, and A. Michelle Masters, who was our Senior Vice President of Strategic Operations and Initiatives. We may not be successful in retaining the members of our senior management team or our other key employees. While we have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Dunn and Mr. Anderson, Mr. Dunn is 64 years old, is nearing the age of retirement, and his employment agreement expires at the end of 2016. The loss of the services of Mr. Dunn, Mr. Anderson, or any member of our senior management or key team members, including state vice presidents, or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel as needed, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We also depend on our district supervisors to supervise, train, and motivate our branch employees. These supervisors have significant experience with our company and within our industry, and would be difficult to replace. If we lose a district supervisor to a competitor, we could also be at risk of losing other employees and customers. In addition, the process of identifying management successors creates uncertainty and could become a distraction to our senior management and our Board of Directors, and we may not be successful in attracting qualified candidates to replace key positions when necessary. The identification and recruitment of candidates to fill senior management positions, when necessary, and the resulting transition process may be disruptive to our business and operations.\nOur convenience check strategy exposes us to certain risks.\nA significant portion of our growth in our small installment loans has been achieved through our direct mail campaigns, which involve mailing to pre-screened recipients \u201cconvenience checks,\u201d which customers can sign and cash or deposit, thereby agreeing to the terms of the loan, which are disclosed on the front and back of the check and in the accompanying disclosures. We use convenience checks to seed new branch openings and attract new customers and those with better credit in our geographic footprint. In 2014 and 2015, loans initiated through convenience checks represented 18.8% and 16.8%, respectively, of the value of our originated loans. We expect that convenience checks will continue to represent a meaningful portion of our small installment loan originations in the future. There are several risks associated with the use of convenience checks, including the following:\n\u2022\nit is more difficult to maintain sound underwriting standards with convenience check customers, and these customers have historically presented a higher risk of default than customers that originate loans in our branches, as we do not meet convenience check customers prior to soliciting them and extending a loan to them, and we may not be able to verify certain elements of their financial condition, including their current employment status or life circumstances;\n\u2022\nwe rely on credit information from a third-party credit bureau that is more limited than a full credit report to pre-screen potential convenience check recipients, which may not be as effective or may be inaccurate or outdated;\n\u2022\nwe face limitations on the number of potential borrowers who meet our lending criteria within proximity to our branches;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to continue to access the demographic and credit file information that we use to generate our mailing lists due to expanded regulatory or privacy restrictions;\n\u2022\nconvenience checks pose a risk of fraud;\n\u2022\nwe depend on one bank to issue and clear our convenience checks, and any failure by that bank to properly process the convenience checks could limit the ability of a recipient to cash the check and enter into a loan with us;\n\u2022\ncustomers may opt out of direct mail solicitations and solicitations based on their credit file or may otherwise prohibit us from soliciting them; and\n\u2022\npostal rates and piece printing rates may continue to rise.\nFor example, in 2014 we experienced a convenience check credit quality deterioration in our direct mail campaigns. We responded to these issues by hiring a Chief Risk Officer and other personnel focused on credit risk management, establishing a Credit Committee to oversee direct mail campaign underwriting and origination processes, implementing additional policies and internal control procedures related to the audit of direct mail campaign files, and improving upon early-stage delinquency reporting and communication. Despite these efforts, we may experience future issues relating to our credit checks and other processes associated with our direct mail strategy. Our expected increase in the use of convenience checks will further increase our exposure to, and the magnitude of, these risks.\nA reduction in demand for our products and failure by us to adapt to such reduction could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe demand for the products we offer may be reduced due to a variety of factors, such as demographic patterns, changes in customer preferences or financial conditions, regulatory restrictions that decrease customer access to particular products, or the availability of competing products. For example, we are highly dependent upon selecting and maintaining attractive branch locations. These locations are subject to local market conditions, including the employment available in the area, housing costs, traffic patterns, crime, and other demographic influences, any of which may quickly change. Should we fail to adapt to significant changes in our customers\u2019 demand for, or access to, our products, our revenues could decrease significantly and our operations could be harmed. Even if we do make changes to existing products or introduce new products to fulfill customer demand, customers may resist or may reject such products. Moreover, the effect of any product change on the results of our business may not be fully ascertainable until the change has been in effect for some time, and by that time it may be too late to make further modifications to such product without causing further harm to our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may attempt to pursue acquisitions or strategic alliances which may be unsuccessful.\nWe may attempt to achieve our business objectives through acquisitions and strategic alliances. We compete with other companies for these opportunities, including companies with greater financial resources, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to effect acquisitions or strategic alliances on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Furthermore, most acquisition targets that we have pursued previously have been significantly smaller than us. We do not have extensive experience with integrating larger acquisitions. In pursuing these transactions, we may experience, among other things:\n\u2022\novervaluing potential targets;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating any acquired companies, branches, or products into our existing business, including integration of account data into our information systems;\n\u2022\ninability to realize the benefits we anticipate in a timely fashion, or at all;\n\u2022\nattrition of key personnel from acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nunexpected losses due to the acquisition of loan portfolios with loans originated using less stringent underwriting criteria;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs, charges, or writedowns; or\n\u2022\nunforeseen operating difficulties that require significant financial and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development and expansion of our existing operations.\nWe are exposed to credit risk in our lending activities.\nOur ability to collect on loans depends on the willingness and repayment ability of our borrowers. Any material adverse change in the ability or willingness of a significant portion of our borrowers to meet their obligations to us, whether due to changes in general economic conditions, the cost of consumer goods, interest rates, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, or other causes over which we have no control, or to changes or events affecting our borrowers such as unemployment, major medical expenses, divorce, or death, would have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition. Further, a substantial majority of our borrowers are non-prime borrowers, who are more likely to be affected, and more severely affected, by adverse macroeconomic conditions. We cannot be certain that our credit administration personnel, policies, and procedures will adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of the loan portfolio.\nWe may be limited in our ability to collect on our loan portfolio, and the security interests securing a significant portion of our loan portfolio are not perfected, which may increase our credit losses.\nLegal and practical limitations may limit our ability to collect on our loan portfolio, resulting in increased credit losses, decreased revenues, and decreased earnings. State and federal laws and regulations restrict our collection efforts. Most of our loan portfolio is secured, but a significant portion of such security interests have not been and will not be perfected, which means that we cannot be certain that such security interests will be given first priority over other creditors. The amounts that we are able to recover from the repossession and sale of collateral typically do not cover the outstanding loan balance and costs of recovery. In cases where we repossess a vehicle securing a loan, we generally sell our repossessed automobile inventory through public sales conducted by independent automobile auction organizations after the required post-repossession waiting period. There is approximately a 30-day period between the time we repossess a vehicle or other property and the time it is sold at auction. In certain instances, we may sell repossessed collateral other than vehicles through our branches after the required post-repossession waiting period and appropriate receipt of valid bids. The proceeds we receive from such sales depend upon various factors, including the supply of, and demand for, used vehicles and other property at the time of sale. During periods of economic slowdown or recession, such as have existed in the United States for much of the past several years, there may be less demand for used vehicles and other property that we desire to resell.\nFurther, a significant portion of our loan portfolio is not secured by perfected security interests, including small installment loans and retail purchase loans. The lack of perfected security interests is one of several factors that may make it more difficult for us to collect on our loan portfolio. During 2015, net charge-offs as a percentage of average finance receivables on our small installment loans, which are typically secured by unperfected interests in personal property, were 11.8%, while net charge-offs as a percentage of average finance receivables for our large installment loans and automobile purchase loans, which are typically secured by perfected interests in an automobile or other vehicle, for the same periods were 2.7% and 6.6%, respectively. Additionally, for those of our loans which are unsecured, borrowers may choose to repay obligations under other indebtedness before repaying loans to us because such borrowers have no collateral at risk. Lastly, given the relatively small size of our loans, the costs of collecting loans may be high relative to the amount of the loan. As a result, many collection practices that are legally available, such as litigation, may be financially impracticable. These factors may increase our credit losses, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, there is an inherent risk that a portion of the retail installment contracts that we hold will be in default or be subject to certain claims or defenses that the borrower may assert against the originator of the contract, or us as the holder of the contract. We face the risk that if high unemployment or adverse economic developments occur or continue in one or more of our markets, a large number of retail installment contracts will become defaulted. In addition, most of the borrowers under these contracts have some negative credit history. There can be no assurance that our allowance for credit losses will prove sufficient to cover actual losses in the future on these contracts.\nOur policies and procedures for underwriting, processing, and servicing loans are subject to potential failure or circumvention, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our underwriting activities and our credit extension decisions are made at our local branches. We train our employees individually onsite in the branch to make loans that conform to our underwriting standards. Such training includes critical aspects of state and federal regulatory compliance, cash handling, account management, and customer relations. Although we have standardized employee manuals, we primarily rely on our district supervisors, with oversight by our state vice presidents, branch auditors, and headquarters personnel, to train and supervise our branch employees, rather than centralized training programs. Therefore, the quality of training and supervision may vary from district to district and branch to branch depending upon the amount of time apportioned to training and supervision and individual interpretations of our operations policies and procedures. In addition, we sometimes rely on third-party service providers in connection with loan underwriting and origination. Any error or failure by a third-party service provider in providing loan underwriting and origination services may cause us to originate loans to borrowers that do not meet our underwriting standards. We cannot be certain that every loan is made in accordance with our underwriting standards and rules. We have in the past experienced some instances of loans extended that varied from our underwriting standards. Variances in underwriting standards and lack of supervision could expose us to greater delinquencies and charge-offs than we have historically experienced.\nIn addition, underwriting decisions are based on information provided by customers, counterparties, and other third parties, including credit bureaus and data aggregators, the inaccuracy or incompleteness of which may adversely affect our results of operations. In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we rely on such information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers, counterparties, and other third parties, including financial information. We also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Our earnings and our financial condition could be negatively impacted to the extent the information furnished to us by and on behalf of customers, counterparties, and other third parties is not correct or complete.\nEmployee misconduct could harm us by subjecting us to significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny, and reputational harm.\nOur reputation is critical to maintaining and developing relationships with our existing and potential customers and third parties with whom we do business. There is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee were to engage - or be accused of engaging - in illegal or suspicious activities, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships, and ability to attract future customers. Employee misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or to determine, based upon such misconduct, that we have not established adequate supervisory systems and procedures to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect and deter violations of such rules. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.\nOur risk management efforts may not be effective.\nWe could incur substantial losses and our business operations could be disrupted if we are unable to effectively identify, manage, monitor, and mitigate financial risks, such as credit risk, interest rate risk, prepayment risk, liquidity risk, and other market-related risks, as well as operational risks related to our business, assets, and liabilities. Our risk management policies, procedures, and techniques may not be sufficient to identify all of the risks we are exposed to, mitigate the risks we have identified, or identify additional risks to which we may become subject in the future.\nWe may be unsuccessful in maintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting.\nControls and procedures are particularly important for consumer finance companies. Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud or material error. Any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) requires management of public companies to develop and implement internal controls over financial reporting and evaluate the effectiveness thereof. Under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of our financial reporting. Any failure to implement current internal controls or required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nIn November 2014, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to controls over the credit risk associated with the origination of direct mail loans. In addition, we have in the past identified significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting. We remediated the material weakness identified in November 2014 effective as of December 31, 2015.\nIf additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future or if our controls and procedures fail or are circumvented, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements, we could be required to restate our financial results, we may be unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements, and we may be unable to maintain compliance with applicable stock exchange listing requirements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price. The discovery of a material weakness and the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remediated, could reduce the market value of shares of our common stock. Additionally, the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency requires management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiency, and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses or significant deficiency in a timely manner. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nIf our estimates of reserves for credit losses are not adequate to absorb actual losses, our provision for credit losses would increase, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for all loans we make. To estimate the appropriate level of credit loss reserves, we consider known and relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability, including the total amount of loans outstanding, historical loan charge-offs, delinquency rates and trends, our current collection patterns, and economic trends. Our methodology for establishing our reserves for credit losses is based in large part on our historic loss experience. If customer behavior changes as a result of economic or other conditions and if we are unable to predict how the unemployment rate and general economic uncertainty may affect our credit loss reserves, our provision may be inadequate. During fiscal 2015, our provision for credit losses was $47.3 million, and we had net charge-offs of $50.4 million related to losses on our loans. As of December 31, 2015, our finance receivables were $628.4 million. Maintaining the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses may require that we make significant and unanticipated increases in our provisions for credit losses, which would materially affect our results of operations. Our credit loss reserves, however, are estimates, and if actual credit losses are materially greater than our credit loss reserves, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Neither state regulators nor federal regulators regulate our allowance for credit losses.\nIf assumptions or estimates we use in preparing our financial statements are incorrect or are required to change, our reported results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), including in determining allowances for loan losses, fair value of financial instruments, asset impairment, reserves related to litigation and other legal matters, valuation of income and other taxes and regulatory exposures. In addition, significant assumptions and estimates are involved in determining certain disclosures required under GAAP, including those involving the fair value of our financial instruments. If the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, the actual amounts realized on transactions and balances subject to those estimates will be different, and this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) is currently reviewing or proposing changes to several financial accounting and reporting standards that govern key aspects of our financial statements, including areas where assumptions or estimates are required. As a result of changes to financial accounting or reporting standards, whether promulgated or required by the FASB or other regulators, we could be required to change certain of the assumptions or estimates we previously used in preparing our financial statements, which could negatively impact how we record and report our results of operations and financial condition generally. For additional information on the key areas for which assumptions and estimates are used in preparing our financial statements, see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 1 (Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies) of our audited Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur use of derivatives exposes us to credit and market risk.\nFrom time to time, we enter into derivative transactions for economic hedging purposes, such as managing our exposure to interest rate risk. By using derivative instruments, we are exposed to credit and market risk, including the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and the funding and/or hedge cost, default risk, and the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular derivative transaction to perform its obligations. For additional information, see Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nInterest rates on automobile purchase and retail purchase loans are determined at competitive market interest rates, and we may fail to adequately set interest rates, which may adversely affect our business.\nOver recent years, we have expanded our automobile purchase loan business and our retail purchase loan business, and we plan to continue to expand those businesses in the future. Unlike installment loans, which in certain states are typically made at or near the maximum interest rates permitted by law, automobile purchase loans and retail purchase loans are often made at competitive market interest rates, which are governed by laws for installment sales contracts. If we fail to set interest rates at a level that adequately reflects market rates or the credit risks of our customers, or if we set interest rates at a level too low to sustain our profitability, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nFailure of third-party service providers upon which we rely could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on certain third-party service providers. In particular, we currently rely on one key vendor to print and mail our convenience checks for our direct mail marketing campaigns, and we rely on certain other third-party service providers in connection with loan underwriting and origination. Our reliance on these and other third parties can expose us to risks. For example, an error by our former convenience check vendor during 2010 and our current convenience check vendor during 2015 resulted in checks being misdirected, requiring us in some cases to notify state regulators and to refund certain interest and fee amounts, and exposing us to increased credit risk. If any of our third-party service providers, including our convenience check vendors and those third\nparties providing services in connection with loan underwriting and origination, are unable to provide their services timely, accurately, and effectively, or at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend to a substantial extent on borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility to fund our liquidity needs.\nWe have a senior revolving credit facility committed through September 2018 that allows us to borrow up to $538.0 million, assuming we are in compliance with a number of covenants and conditions. The credit facility also has an accordion provision that allows for the expansion of the facility to up to $600.0 million. The senior revolving credit facility is collateralized by certain of our assets, including substantially all of our finance receivables and equity interests of the majority of our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2015, the amount outstanding under our senior revolving credit facility was $338.3 million and we had $199.7 million of unused capacity on the credit facility (subject to certain covenants and conditions). During fiscal 2015, the maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under the facility at one time was $403.1 million. We use our senior revolving credit facility as a source of liquidity, including for working capital and to fund the loans we make to our customers. If our existing sources of liquidity become insufficient to satisfy our financial needs or our access to these sources becomes unexpectedly restricted, we may need to try to raise additional debt or equity in the future. If such an event were to occur, we can give no assurance that such alternate sources of liquidity would be available to us on favorable terms or at all. In addition, we cannot be certain that we will be able to replace the amended and restated senior revolving credit facility when it matures on favorable terms or at all. If any of these events occur, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nMacroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, and may increase loan defaults and affect the value and liquidity of your investment.\nWe are not insulated from the pressures and potentially negative consequences of financial crises and similar risks beyond our control that have in the past and may in the future affect the capital and credit markets, the broader economy, the financial services industry, or the segment of that industry in which we operate.\nBeginning in 2007, the global economy experienced a significant recession, as well as a severe, ongoing disruption in the credit markets and a material and adverse effect on the jobs market and individual borrowers. While the United States economy may technically have come out of this recession, the recovery is fragile and may not be sustainable for any specific period of time, and could slip back into an even more significant recession. Our financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of our borrowers to make payments on outstanding loans, is highly dependent upon the business and economic environments in the markets where we operate and in the United States as a whole.\nDuring an economic downturn or recession, credit losses in the financial services industry generally increase and demand for credit products often decreases. Declining asset values, defaults on consumer loans, and the lack of market and investor confidence, as well as other factors, all combine to decrease liquidity during an economic downturn. As a result of these factors, some banks and other lenders have suffered significant losses during economic downturns, and the strength and liquidity of many financial institutions worldwide has weakened due to the most recent economic crisis. Additionally, during an economic downturn, our loan servicing costs and collection costs may increase as we may have to expend greater time and resources on these activities. Our underwriting criteria, policies and procedures, and product offerings may not sufficiently protect our growth and profitability during a sustained period of economic downturn or recession. Any renewed economic downturn will adversely affect the financial resources of our customers and may result in the inability of our customers to make principal and interest payments on, or refinance, the outstanding debt when due.\nIn addition, periods of economic slowdown or recession are typically accompanied by decreased consumer demand for automobiles and other retail goods. Our ability to originate automobile purchase loans and retail\npurchase loans depends, in large part, on the underlying demand for such products. Further, our business is focused on customers who generally do not qualify for conventional automobile or retail financing, and customers in this demographic are more likely to be affected, and more severely affected, by an economic downturn. Accordingly, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted during any economic downturn or recession.\nShould economic conditions worsen, they may adversely affect the credit quality of our loans. In the event of increased default by borrowers under the loans, and/or a decrease in the volume of the loans we originate, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk resulting from general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies.\nInterest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect our results of operations and financial condition. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Furthermore, market conditions or regulatory restrictions on interest rates we charge may prevent us from passing any increases in interest rates along to our customers. We originate finance receivables at either prevailing market rates or at statutory limits. Subject to statutory limits, our ability to react to changes in prevailing market rates is dependent upon the speed at which our customers pay off or renew loans in our existing loan portfolio, which allows us to originate new loans at prevailing market rates. Our loan portfolio turns over approximately 1.5 times per year from cash payments, renewals, and charged-off loans. Because our automobile loans have longer maturities and typically are not refinanced prior to maturity, the rate of turnover of the loan portfolio may change as these loans change as a percentage of our portfolio.\nIn addition, rising interest rates will increase our cost of capital by influencing the amount of interest we pay on our senior revolving credit facility or any other floating interest rate obligations we may incur, which would increase our operating costs and decrease our operating margins. Interest payable on our senior revolving credit facility is variable, based on LIBOR with a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, and could increase in the future.\nOur insurance operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including claims.\nWe market and sell optional credit life, credit accident and health, credit personal property, and credit involuntary unemployment insurance in connection with our loans in selected markets as an agent for an unaffiliated third-party insurance company. The policies are then ceded to our wholly-owned reinsurance subsidiary, RMC Reinsurance, Ltd., which then bears the full risk of the policies. Insurance claims and policyholder liabilities are difficult to predict and may exceed the related reserves set aside for claims and associated expenses for claims adjudication. In addition, in 2016, we plan to transition our insurance business to a new unaffiliated third-party insurance company. The transition is complex and will include, among other things, the retraining of our branch network and the reprogramming of our loan management system to appropriately calculate premium amounts and to generate required disclosures on a state-by-state basis. Any failure to timely transition our insurance operations to the new unaffiliated third-party insurance company will result in our inability to offer our insurance products in certain states, which will have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOther risks relating to our insurance operations include changes to laws and regulations applicable to us, as well as changes to the regulatory environment. Examples include changes to laws or regulations affecting capital and reserve requirements; frequency and type of regulatory monitoring and reporting; consumer privacy, use of customer data, and data security; benefits or loss ratio requirements; insurance producer licensing or appointment requirements; required disclosures to consumers; and collateral protection insurance (i.e., insurance purchased at the borrower\u2019s expense on the borrower\u2019s loan collateral for the periods of time the borrower fails to adequately, as required by his or her loan, insure that collateral). Because our borrowers do not affirmatively consent to\ncollateral protection insurance at the time it is purchased and, hence, do not directly agree to the amount charged for it, regulators may in the future prohibit us from providing this insurance. Moreover, our insurance operation is dependent on our lending operation for its sole source of business and product distribution. If our lending operations discontinue offering insurance products, our insurance operations would have no method of distribution, and our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur revolving credit agreement contains restrictions and limitations that could affect our ability to operate our business.\nThe credit agreement governing our senior revolving credit facility contains a number of covenants that could adversely affect our business and the flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or opportunities. Among other things, these covenants limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npurchase large loan portfolios in bulk;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock or make certain other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nsell assets, including our loan portfolio or the capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022\noffer certain loan products;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition, the credit agreement imposes certain obligations on us relating to our underwriting standards, recordkeeping and servicing of our loans, and our loss reserves and charge-off policies. It also requires us to maintain certain financial ratios, including an interest coverage ratio and a borrowing base ratio. If we were to breach any covenants or obligations under the credit agreement and such breaches were to result in an event of default, our lenders could cause all amounts outstanding to become due and payable, subject to applicable grace periods. This could trigger cross-defaults under existing and future debt instruments, and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to continue operating our business as a going concern.\nWe rely on information technology products developed, owned, and supported by third parties, including our competitors. Our ability to manage our business and monitor results is highly dependent upon these information technology products. A failure of these products and systems or of the implementation of new information technology products and systems could disrupt our business.\nIn the operation of our business, we are highly dependent upon a variety of information technology products, including our loan management system, which allows us to record, document, and manage our loan portfolio. We currently use a loan management software package developed and owned by ParaData Financial Systems (\u201cParaData\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of World Acceptance Corporation, one of our primary competitors. Over the years, we have tailored this software to meet our specific needs. We depend on the willingness and ability of ParaData to continue to provide customized solutions and support our evolving products and business model. In the future, ParaData may not be willing or able to modify the loan management software to meet our needs, or it could alter the program without notice to us or cease to adequately support it. ParaData could also decide in the future to refuse to provide support for its software to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If any of these events were to occur, we would be forced to migrate to an alternative software package, which could materially affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe rely on DealerTrack, Route One, Teledata Communications Inc., and other third-party software vendors to provide access to loan applications and/or screen applications. There can be no assurance that these\nthird party providers will continue to provide us information in accordance with our lending guidelines or that they will continue to provide us lending leads at all. If this occurs, our credit losses, business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nSecurity breaches in our branches or acts of theft, fraud, or violence could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nNearly all of our account payments occur at our branches, either in person or by mail, and frequently consist of cash payments, which we deposit at local banks throughout the day. This business practice exposes us daily to the potential for employee theft of funds or, alternatively, to theft and burglary due to the cash we maintain in our branches. Despite controls and procedures to prevent such losses, we have in the past sustained losses due to employee fraud (including collusion) and theft. We are also susceptible to break-ins at our branches, where money and/or customer records could be taken. A breach in the security of our branches or in the safety of our employees could result in employee injury, loss of funds or records, and adverse publicity, and could result in a loss of customer business or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches, cyber-attacks, failures in our information systems, or fraudulent activity could result in damage to our operations or lead to reputational damage.\nWe also rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Each branch is part of an information network that is designed to permit us to maintain adequate cash inventory, reconcile cash balances on a daily basis, and report revenues and expenses to our headquarters. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security of these systems, including any failure of our back-up systems, hardware failures, or an inability to access data maintained offsite, could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, loan, and other systems and could result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation, possible financial liability, and other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may not be able to detect immediately any such breach, which may increase the losses that we would suffer. In addition, our existing insurance policies would not reimburse us for all of the damages that we might incur as a result of a breach.\nA security breach or cyber-attack on our computer systems could interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation. Despite the implementation of security measures, our systems may still be vulnerable to data theft, computer viruses, programming errors, attacks by third parties, or similar disruptive problems. If we were to experience a security breach or cyber-attack, we could be required to incur substantial costs and liabilities, including, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nexpenses to rectify the consequences of the security breach or cyber-attack;\n\u2022\nliability for stolen assets or information;\n\u2022\ncosts of repairing damage to our systems;\n\u2022\nlost revenue and income resulting from any system downtime caused by such breach or attack;\n\u2022\nincreased costs of cyber security protection;\n\u2022\ncosts of incentives we may be required to offer to our customers or business partners to retain their business; and\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation causing customers and investors to lose confidence in our company.\nIn addition, any compromise of security or a cyber-attack could deter consumers from entering into transactions that require them to provide confidential information to us. Further, if confidential customer\ninformation or information belonging to our business partners is misappropriated from our computer systems, we could be sued by those who assert that we did not take adequate precautions to safeguard our systems and confidential data belonging to our customers or business partners, which could subject us to liability and result in significant legal fees and expenses of defending these claims. As a result, any compromise of security of our computer systems or cyber-attack could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to make technological improvements as quickly as some of our competitors, which could harm our competitive ability and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. We rely on our integrated branch network as the foundation of our multiple channel platform and the primary point of contact with our active accounts. However, to serve customers who want to reach us over the Internet, we developed a new channel in late 2008 by making an online loan application available on our consumer website, and in late 2015, we began testing end-to-end origination of unsecured consumer loans via our website. Our future success and, in particular, the success of our online sourcing, will depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demand for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. If we fail to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly as some of our competitors or if we fail to be successful in marketing these products to our customers, our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial condition may be harmed.\nOur centralized headquarters\u2019 functions and branch operations are susceptible to disruption by catastrophic events, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur headquarters buildings are located in Greenville, South Carolina. Our information systems and administrative and management processes are primarily provided to our branches from this centralized location, and our separate data management facility is located in the same city. These processes could be disrupted if a catastrophic event, such as a tornado, power outage, or act of terror, affected Greenville. Any such catastrophic event or other unexpected disruption of our headquarters or data management facility could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may be required to repurchase certain finance receivables if these finance receivables fail to meet certain criteria or characteristics or under other circumstances, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nOn December 11, 2015, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Regional Management Receivables, LLC (\u201cRMR\u201d), entered into a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as administrative agent. This credit agreement provides for a $75.7 million amortizing loan to RMR that is secured by certain retail installment contracts and promissory notes secured by new or used automobiles, light-duty trucks, minivans, sport utility vehicles, and other passenger vehicles (excluding motorcycles) which were originated (either directly or indirectly) by certain of our subsidiaries (the \u201cReceivables\u201d). On the closing date of the transactions contemplated by the credit agreement, RMR made certain representations and warranties about the quality and nature of the Receivables. The amortizing loan requires RMR to pay the administrative agent a release fee for the release of certain Receivables as collateral under certain circumstances, including circumstances in which the representations and warranties made by RMR concerning the quality and characteristics of the Receivables are inaccurate.\nAs a result of the current market environment, we believe that many purchasers of loans and other counterparties to transactions like those provided for in the amortizing loan and other similar securitization\ntransactions are particularly aware of the conditions under which originators must indemnify for or repurchase finance receivables, and may benefit from enforcing any available repurchase remedies. If we are required to repurchase Receivables that we have sold or pledged, this could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Regulation and Legal Proceedings\nOur business products and activities are strictly and comprehensively regulated at the local, state, and federal level.\nOur business is subject to numerous local, state, and federal laws and regulations. These regulations impose significant costs and limitations on the way we conduct and expand our business, and these costs and limitations may increase in the future if such laws and regulations are changed. These laws and regulations govern or affect, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe interest rates that we may charge customers;\n\u2022\nterms of loans, including fees, maximum amounts, and minimum durations;\n\u2022\nthe number of simultaneous or consecutive loans and required waiting periods between loans;\n\u2022\ndisclosure practices, including posting of fees;\n\u2022\ncurrency and suspicious activity reporting;\n\u2022\nrecording and reporting of certain financial transactions;\n\u2022\nprivacy of personal customer information;\n\u2022\nthe types of products and services that we may offer;\n\u2022\ncollection practices;\n\u2022\napproval of licenses; and\n\u2022\nlocations of our branches.\nChanges to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies, including the interpretation, implementation, and enforcement of statutes, regulations, or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including limiting the types of financial services and products that we may offer and increasing the ability of competitors to offer competing financial services and products. Compliance with laws and regulations requires us to invest increasingly significant portions of our resources in compliance planning and training, monitoring tools, and personnel, and requires the time and attention of management. These costs divert capital and focus away from efforts intended to grow our business. Because these laws and regulations are complex and often subject to interpretation, or because of a result of unintended errors, we may, from time to time, inadvertently violate these laws, regulations, and policies, as each is interpreted by our regulators. If we do not successfully comply with laws, regulations, or policies, our compliance costs could increase, our operations could be limited, and we may suffer damage to our reputation. If more restrictive laws, rules, and regulations are enacted or more restrictive judicial and administrative interpretations of those laws are issued, compliance with the laws could become more expensive or difficult. Furthermore, changes in these laws and regulations could require changes in the way we conduct our business, and we cannot predict the impact such changes would have on our profitability.\nOur primary regulators are the state regulators for the states in which we operate: Alabama, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. We operate each of our branches under licenses granted to us by these state regulators. State regulators may enter our branches and conduct audits of our records and practices at any time, with or without notice. If we fail to observe, or are not able to comply with, applicable legal requirements, we may be forced to discontinue certain product offerings, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, violation\nof these laws and regulations could result in fines and other civil and/or criminal penalties, including the suspension or revocation of our branch licenses, rendering us unable to operate in one or more locations. All of the states in which we operate have laws governing the interest rate and fees that we can charge and required disclosure statements, among other restrictions. Violation of these laws could involve penalties requiring the forfeiture of principal and/or interest and fees that we have charged. Depending on the nature and scope of a violation, fines and other penalties for noncompliance of applicable requirements could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, and financial condition.\nLicenses to open new branches are granted in the discretion of state regulators. Accordingly, licenses may be denied unexpectedly or for reasons outside of our control. This could hinder our ability to implement our business plans in a timely manner or at all.\nAs we enter new markets and develop new products, we may become subject to additional state and federal regulations. For example, although we intend to expand into new states, we may encounter unexpected regulatory or other difficulties in these new states or markets, which may prevent us from growing in new states or markets. Similarly, while we intend to grow our retail purchase and indirect automobile purchase loan operations, we may encounter unexpected regulatory or other difficulties. As a result, we may not be able to successfully execute our strategies to grow our revenue and earnings.\nChanges in laws and regulations or interpretations of laws and regulations could negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe laws and regulations directly affecting our lending activities are under review and are subject to change, especially as a result of current economic conditions, changes in the make-up of the current executive and legislative branches, and the political focus on issues of consumer and borrower protection. In addition, consumer advocacy groups and various other media sources continue to advocate for governmental and regulatory action to prohibit or severely restrict various financial products, including the loan products we offer.\nAny changes in such laws and regulations, or the implementation, interpretation, or enforcement of such laws and regulations, could force us to modify, suspend, or cease part or, in the worst case, all of our existing operations. It is also possible that the scope of federal regulations could change or expand in such a way as to preempt what has traditionally been state law regulation of our business activities. The enactment of one or more of such regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nState and federal legislatures and regulators may also seek to impose new requirements or interpret or enforce existing requirements in new ways. Changes in current laws or regulations or the implementation of new laws or regulations in the future may restrict our ability to continue our current methods of operation or expand our operations. Additionally, these laws and regulations could subject us to liability for prior operating activities or lower or eliminate the profitability of operations going forward by, among other things, reducing the amount of interest and fees we charge in connection with our loans. If these or other factors lead us to close our branches in a state, in addition to the loss of net revenues attributable to that closing, we would incur closing costs such as lease cancellation payments and we would have to write off assets that we could no longer use. If we were to suspend rather than permanently cease our operations in a state, we would also have continuing costs associated with maintaining our branches and our employees in that state, with little or no revenues to offset those costs.\nIn addition to state and federal laws and regulations, our business is subject to various local rules and regulations, such as local zoning regulations. Local zoning boards and other local governing bodies have been increasingly restricting the permitted locations of consumer finance companies. Any future actions taken to require special use permits for, or impose other restrictions on, our ability to provide products could adversely affect our ability to expand our operations or force us to attempt to relocate existing branches. If we were forced to relocate any of our branches, in addition to the costs associated with the relocation, we may be required to hire\nnew employees in the new areas, which may adversely impact the operations of those branches. Relocation of an existing branch may also hinder our collection abilities, as our business model relies in part on the location of our branches being close to where our customers live in order to successfully collect on outstanding loans.\nChanges in laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on all aspects of our business in a particular state and on our overall business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) authorizes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \u201cCFPB\u201d) to adopt rules that could potentially have a serious impact on our ability to offer short-term consumer loans and have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\nTitle X of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes the CFPB, which became operational on July 21, 2011. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB has regulatory, supervisory, and enforcement powers over providers of consumer financial products that we offer, including explicit supervisory authority to examine and require registration of installment lenders such as ourselves. Included in the powers afforded to the CFPB is the authority to adopt rules describing specified acts and practices as being \u201cunfair,\u201d \u201cdeceptive,\u201d or \u201cabusive,\u201d and hence unlawful. Specifically, the CFPB has the authority to declare an act or practice abusive if it, among other things, materially interferes with the ability of a consumer to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or takes unreasonable advantage of a lack of understanding on the part of the consumer of the product or service. Although the Dodd-Frank Act expressly provides that the CFPB has no authority to establish usury limits, some consumer advocacy groups have suggested that certain forms of alternative consumer finance products, such as installment loans, should be a regulatory priority, and it is possible that at some time in the future, the CFPB could propose and adopt rules making such lending or other products that we may offer materially less profitable or impractical. Further, the CFPB may target specific features of loans or loan practices, such as refinancings, by rulemaking that could cause us to cease offering certain products or engaging in certain practices. It is possible that the CFPB will adopt rules that specifically restrict refinancings of existing loans. Our refinancings of existing loans are divided into three categories: refinancings of loans in an amount greater than the original loan amount, renewals of existing loans at or below the original loan amount, and renewals of existing loans that are 60 or more days past due, which represented 31.5%, 26.8%, and 0.5%, respectively, of our loan originations in 2015. Any such rules could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, and financial condition. The CFPB could also adopt rules imposing new and potentially burdensome requirements and limitations with respect to any of our current or future lines of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB the authority to examine and regulate entities it classifies as a \u201clarger participant of a market for other consumer financial products or services.\u201d The rule will likely cover only the largest installment lenders. We do not yet know whether the definition of larger participant in the installment lending market will cover us. In June 2015, the CFPB adopted a rule defining larger participants of the automobile financing market as nonbank lenders that have at least 10,000 aggregate annual originations. In addition, this rule defined the term \u201cfinancial product or service\u201d to include refinancings and certain automobile leases but to exclude title loans. While our automobile purchase loan originations at this time do not qualify us as a larger participant in the automobile financing market, the continued expansion of our automobile lending operations may in the future cause us to qualify as a larger participant in the automobile financing market.\nIn March 2015, the CFPB announced that it was considering proposing rules under its unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices rulemaking authority relating to payday, vehicle title, and similar loans. The proposal would cover short-term loans with a contractual term of 45 days or less, as well as \u201clonger-term loans\u201d with a term of longer than 45 days with an \u201call in\u201d annualized percentage rate of interest in excess of 36% in which the lender has either a non-purchase money security interest in the consumer\u2019s vehicle or certain rights to collect repayment from the consumer\u2019s bank account or paycheck. While we do not originate loans with a contractual term of 45 days or less, we do originate longer-term loans with an \u201call in\u201d annual percentage rate of\ninterest in excess of 36% and take a non-purchase money security interest in a vehicle. The proposals would require a lender, as a condition of making a covered longer-term loan, to first make a good-faith reasonable determination that the consumer has the ability to repay the covered longer-term loan without reborrowing or defaulting. The proposals would require lenders to verify income, \u201cmajor financial obligations,\u201d and borrowing history. Lenders would also be required to determine that a consumer is able to make all projected payments under the covered longer-term loan as those payments are due, while still fulfilling other major financial obligations and meeting living expenses. This ability to repay assessment would apply to both the initial longer-term loan and to any subsequent refinancing. In addition, the proposals would include a rebuttable presumption that customers seeking to refinance a covered longer-term loan lack an \u201cability to repay\u201d if certain conditions exist at the time of the proposed refinancing. The proposals are subject to several procedural requirements and to possible change before any final rules would be issued and implemented, and we cannot predict what the ultimate rulemaking will provide. These proposals, if and when implemented in final rulemaking, may require changes to our practices and procedures regarding such loans that could materially and adversely affect our ability to make such loans, the cost of making such loans, our ability to, or frequency with which we are able to, refinance any such covered loans, or the profitability of such loans.\nThe CFPB is also conducting supervisory audits of large vehicle lenders and has indicated it intends to study and take action with respect to possible Equal Credit Opportunity Act \u201cdisparate impact\u201d credit discrimination in indirect vehicle finance. If the CFPB enters into a consent decree with one or more lenders on disparate impact claims, it could negatively impact the business of the affected lenders, and potentially the business of dealers and other lenders in the vehicle finance market. This impact on dealers and lenders could increase our regulatory compliance requirements and associated costs.\nIn October 2015, the CFPB announced that it is considering proposing rules to regulate the use of arbitration agreements in consumer financial products or services. The proposal would apply to installment loans, credit cards, checking and deposit accounts, prepaid cards, money transfer services, auto title loans, small dollar or payday loans, and several other types of financial products or services. The proposal would require any arbitration agreement subject to the rule to provide explicitly that the arbitration agreement is inapplicable to cases filed in court on behalf of a class unless and until class certification is denied or the class claims are dismissed. The proposal also would require persons subject to the rulemaking, and who continue to use arbitration agreements, to submit information on initial claim filings and awards to the CFPB. Such claims or awards information could ultimately be published by the CFPB. These proposals may have a direct material impact on our operations by increasing our litigation costs and requiring us to incur expenses related to the modification of our contracts to comply with the rule. In addition, any publication of claims or awards involving us could result in reputational damage.\nIn addition to the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s grant of regulatory powers to the CFPB, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for violations of federal consumer financial laws. In these proceedings, the CFPB can obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief) and monetary penalties ranging from a maximum of $5,000 per day for minor violations of federal consumer financial laws (including the CFPB\u2019s own rules) to $25,000 per day for reckless violations and $1 million per day for knowing violations. If we are subject to such administrative proceedings, litigation, orders, or monetary penalties in the future, this could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. Also, where a company has violated Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act or CFPB regulations under Title X, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the CFPB (but not for civil penalties). If the CFPB or one or more state officials find that we have violated the foregoing laws, they could exercise their enforcement powers in ways that would have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn January 2012, the CFPB launched a federal supervision program for nonbanks that offer or provide consumer financial products or services. Under the CFPB\u2019s nonbank supervision program, the CFPB conducts\nindividual examinations and requires reports from businesses to determine what businesses require greater focus by the CFPB. The frequency and scope of any such examinations will depend on the CFPB\u2019s analysis of risks posed to consumers based on factors such as a particular nonbank\u2019s volume of business, types of products or services, and the extent of state oversight. In conducting an investigation, the CFPB may issue a civil investigative demand (a \u201cCID\u201d) requiring a target company to prepare and submit, among other items, documents, written reports, answers to interrogatories, and deposition testimony. If the CFPB issues a CID to us or otherwise commences an investigation of our company, the required response could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources. In addition, the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of the initiation of a CFPB investigation of our company or even the perception that such an investigation could occur, even in the absence of any finding by the CFPB that we have violated any state or federal law.\nWe sell certain of our loans, including, in some instances, charged-off loans and loans where the borrower is in default. This practice could subject us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, which may expose us to legal action, cause us to incur losses, and/or limit or impede our collection activity.\nOn December 23, 2015, we sold approximately $112 million of our existing charged-off loan portfolio and committed to the sale of the forward flow of accounts charged off between November 2015 and October 2016. As part of our business model, we may purchase and sell other finance receivables in the future, including loans that have been charged-off and loans where the borrower is in default. The CFPB and other regulators recently have significantly increased their scrutiny of debt sales, especially delinquent and charged-off debt. The CFPB has criticized sellers of debt for insufficient documentation to support and verify the validity or amount of the debt. It has also criticized debt collectors for, among other things, collection tactics, attempting to collect debts that are no longer valid, misrepresenting the amount of the debt, and not having sufficient documentation to verify the validity or amount of the debt. Accordingly, our sales of loans could expose us to lawsuits or fines by regulators if we do not have sufficient documentation to support and verify the validity and amount of the loans underlying the transactions, or if we or purchasers of our loans use collection methods that are viewed as unfair, deceptive, or abusive. In addition, our collections could suffer and we may incur additional expenses if we are required to change collection practices or stop collecting on certain debts as a result of a lawsuit or action on the part of regulators.\nIn addition, our $75.7 million amortizing asset-backed loan resembles a securitization of asset-backed securities transaction. The Dodd-Frank Act may adversely affect the securitization market because it requires, among other things, that a securitizer generally retain not less than 5% of the credit risk for certain types of securitized assets that are transferred, sold, or conveyed through issuance of asset-backed securities. These regulations and others may result in additional costs or limit our ability to securitize loans or engage in similar transactions in the future.\nOur use of third-party vendors is subject to increasing regulatory attention.\nRecently, the CFPB and other regulators have issued regulatory guidance that has focused on the need for financial institutions to perform increased due diligence and ongoing monitoring of third-party vendor relationships, thus increasing the scope of management involvement and decreasing the benefit that we receive from using third-party vendors. Moreover, if regulators conclude that we have not met the heightened standards for oversight of our third-party vendors, we could be subject to enforcement actions, civil monetary penalties, supervisory orders to cease and desist, or other remedial actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results\nWe are subject to government regulations concerning our hourly and our other employees, including minimum wage, overtime, and health care laws.\nWe are subject to applicable rules and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees, including minimum wage and break requirements, health benefits, unemployment and sales taxes, overtime, and\nworking conditions and immigration status. Legislated increases in the federal minimum wage and increases in additional labor cost components, such as employee benefit costs, workers\u2019 compensation insurance rates, compliance costs and fines, as well as the cost of litigation in connection with these regulations, would increase our labor costs. Unionizing and collective bargaining efforts have received increased attention nationwide in recent periods. Should our employees become represented by unions, we would be obligated to bargain with those unions with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, which is likely to increase our labor costs. Moreover, as part of the process of union organizing and collective bargaining, strikes and other work stoppages may occur, which would cause disruption to our business. Similarly, many employers nationally in similar retail environments have been subject to actions brought by governmental agencies and private individuals under wage-hour laws on a variety of claims, such as improper classification of workers as exempt from overtime pay requirements and failure to pay overtime wages properly, with such actions sometimes brought as class actions. These actions can result in material liabilities and expenses. Should we be subject to employment litigation, such as actions involving wage-hour, overtime, break, and working time, it may distract our management from business matters and result in increased labor costs. In addition, we currently sponsor employer-subsidized premiums for major medical programs for eligible personnel who elect health care coverage through our insurance programs. As a result of regulatory changes, we may not be able to continue to offer health care coverage to our employees on affordable terms or at all and subsequently may face increased difficulty in hiring and retaining employees. If we are unable to locate, attract, train, or retain qualified personnel, or if our costs of labor increase significantly, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nRising health care costs and continuing uncertainties concerning the effect of implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 and similar laws may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nDespite our efforts to control costs while still providing competitive health care benefits to our employees, significant increases in health care costs continue to occur, and we can provide no assurance that our cost containment efforts in this area will be effective. In March 2010, the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cPPACA\u201d) and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 became law. While we have performed an analysis regarding the anticipated impact of these laws on our cost structure, we may be unable to accurately predict the impact of this federal health care legislation on our health care benefit costs due to continued uncertainty with respect to implementation of such legislation. Significant increases in costs due either to the PPACA or general health care cost increases are likely and could adversely impact our operating results, as there is no assurance that we will be able to absorb, pass through, and/or offset the costs of such legislation.\nOur stock price or results of operations could be adversely affected by media and public perception of installment and automobile loans and of legislative and regulatory developments affecting activities within the installment and automobile lending sector.\nConsumer advocacy groups and various media sources continue to criticize alternative financial services providers (such as payday and title lenders, check advance companies, and pawnshops). These critics frequently characterize such alternative financial services providers as predatory or abusive toward consumers. If these persons were to criticize the products that we offer, it could result in further regulation of our business and could negatively impact our relationships with existing borrowers and efforts to attract new borrowers. Furthermore, our industry is highly regulated, and announcements regarding new or expected governmental and regulatory action in the alternative financial services sector may adversely impact our stock price and perceptions of our business even if such actions are not targeted at our operations and do not directly impact us.\nLegal proceedings to which we are subject or may become subject may have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nLike many companies in our industry, we are from time to time involved in various legal proceedings and subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities brought by borrowers and others, including,\nfor example, the securities class action lawsuit described in Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and, regardless of the merits of the claims, litigation is often expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and resources, and distracting to management. If resolved against us, such legal proceedings could result in excessive verdicts and judgments, injunctive relief, equitable relief, and other adverse consequences that may affect our financial condition and how we operate our business. Similarly, if we settle such legal proceedings, it may affect our financial condition and how we operate our business. Future court decisions, alternative dispute resolution awards, business expansion, or legislative activity may increase our exposure to litigation and regulatory investigations. In some cases, substantial non-economic remedies or punitive damages may be sought. Although we maintain liability insurance coverage, there can be no assurance that such coverage will cover any particular verdict, judgment, or settlement that may be entered against us, that such coverage will prove to be adequate, or that such coverage will continue to remain available on acceptable terms, if at all. For example, we and our primary insurance carrier may in the future be required to negotiate an allocation between denied and acknowledged claims in the securities class action lawsuit. If in the securities class action lawsuit or any other legal proceeding we incur liability that exceeds our insurance coverage or that is not within the scope of the coverage in legal proceedings brought against us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCurrent and proposed regulation related to consumer privacy, data protection, and information security could increase our costs.\nWe are subject to a number of federal and state consumer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations. Moreover, various federal and state regulatory agencies require us to notify customers in the event of a security breach. Federal and state legislators and regulators are increasingly pursuing new guidance, laws, and regulations. Compliance with current or future customer privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations could result in higher compliance, technology, or other operating costs. Any violations of these laws and regulations may require us to change our business practices or operational structure, and could subject us to legal claims, monetary penalties, sanctions, and the obligation to indemnify and/or notify customers or take other remedial actions.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they downgrade their recommendations regarding our common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price may decline. If analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline and our common stock to be less liquid.\nThe market price of shares of our common stock may continue to be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market, or political conditions, could reduce the market price of shares of our common stock in spite of our operating performance. In addition, our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors due to a number of potential factors, including variations in our quarterly operating results, additions or departures of key management personnel, failure to meet analysts\u2019 earnings estimates, publication of research reports about our industry, litigation and government investigations, changes or\nproposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement thereof affecting our business, adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future, changes in market valuations of similar companies or speculation in the press or investment community, announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments, adverse publicity about the industries we participate in, or individual scandals, and in response the market price of shares of our common stock could decrease significantly.\nIn the past several years, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company\u2019s securities, Securities and Exchange Commission investigations and securities class action litigation have sometimes been instituted against these companies. We currently are subject to a securities class action lawsuit described in Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The securities class action lawsuit and any further legal proceedings of this nature that may be instituted against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Instead, we intend to retain future earnings, if any, for future operation, expansion, for our share repurchase program, and debt repayment. The declaration, amount, and payment of any future cash dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax, and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of cash dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur, including our senior revolving credit facility. As a result, investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may not occur, as the only way to realize future gains on their investment.\nYour stock ownership may be diluted by the future issuance of additional common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions, or otherwise.\nWe have approximately 987 million shares of common stock authorized but unissued. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue these shares of common stock and options, rights, warrants, and appreciation rights relating to common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. On April 22, 2015, our stockholders approved the Regional Management Corp. 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the \u201c2015 Plan\u201d). Subject to adjustments as provided in the 2015 Plan, the maximum aggregate number of shares of our common stock that may be issued under the 2015 Plan may not exceed the sum of (a) 350,000 shares plus (b) any shares (i) remaining available for the grant of awards as of the effective date under the 2007 Management Incentive Plan (the \u201c2007 Plan\u201d) or the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2011 Plan\u201d), and/or (ii) subject to an award granted under the 2007 Plan or the 2011 Plan, which award is forfeited, cancelled, terminated, expires or lapses. We have 566,683 shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan, as of February 18, 2016. In addition, our Board may recommend in the future that our stockholders approve new stock plans. Any common stock that we issue, including under our 2015 Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership held by our stockholders. In addition, the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to issue equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result of these exemptions, our stockholders may not have access to certain information that they may deem important.\nWe could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30th before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31st. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act . These requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. To maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, we will need to commit significant resources, hire additional staff, and provide additional management oversight. We will be implementing additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies. In addition, sustaining our growth also will require us to commit additional management, operational, and financial resources to identify new professionals to join our firm and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion. These activities may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. We expect to incur significant annual expenses related to these steps and, among other things, additional directors and officers liability insurance, director fees, reporting requirements, transfer agent fees, hiring additional accounting, legal, and administrative personnel, increased auditing and legal fees, and similar expenses.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and applicable state law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our Board of Directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which will require all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to make, alter, or repeal our bylaws and that our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of 80% or more of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, a Texas regulation requires, under certain circumstances, the approval of the Texas Consumer Credit Commissioner for the acquisition, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the voting or common stock of a consumer finance company. The overall effect of this law, and similar laws in other states, is to make it more difficult to acquire a consumer finance company than it might be to acquire control of a nonregulated corporation.\nFurthermore, as a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision renouncing our interest and expectancy in certain corporate opportunities identified by our affiliates.\nCertain of our stockholders, directors, and their affiliates are in the business of providing buyout capital and growth capital to developing companies and may acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for the allocation of certain corporate opportunities between us, on the one hand, and certain of our stockholders, on the other hand. As set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, neither such stockholders, nor any director, officer, stockholder, member, manager, or employee of such stockholders, will have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. Therefore, a director or officer of our company who also serves as a director, officer, member, manager, or employee of such stockholders may pursue certain acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, such acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by such stockholders to themselves or their other affiliates instead of to us.", "PERMNO": 13302, "SIC": 6141, "TIC": "RM"}
