{"cik": "18172", "company": "A. M. Castle & Co.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - Risk Factors\n(Dollar amounts in millions, except per share data)\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within our control, that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. You should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Any of the following risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our debt instruments.\nWe have substantial debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2019, we had $324.3 million of total debt outstanding, all of which is secured. The debt outstanding, in order of priority, was comprised of $127.8 million of borrowings under our Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (as amended, the \u201cABL Credit Agreement\u201d), $193.7 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% / 7.00% Convertible Senior Secured Paid In Kind (PIK) Toggle Notes due 2022 (the \u201cSecond Lien Notes\u201d), including $2.3 million of restricted Second Lien Notes issued to certain members of management (\u201cMIP Notes\u201d), and short-term borrowings of approximately $2.9 million under a local credit facility (see Note 2 - Debt). Our debt instruments currently limit our ability to pay in cash the interest accruing on our Second Lien Notes, so the amount of Second Lien Notes outstanding continues to increase quarterly as interest is paid in kind. The ABL Credit Agreement and the Second Lien Notes are secured by collateral security interests in substantially all of our assets and are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could have significant effects on our business, including the following:\n\u2022it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations;\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, or general corporate purposes may be impaired;\n\u2022we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest on our indebtedness, which will reduce the funds available to use for operations and other purposes, including potentially accretive acquisitions;\n\u2022our ability to fund a change of control offer under our debt instruments may be limited;\n\u2022our substantial level of indebtedness could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt or could affect our ability to secure favorable contracts with certain customers or suppliers;\n\u2022our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate may be limited; and\n\u2022our substantial level of indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business.\nThe ABL Credit Agreement provides for a $125.0 million senior secured, revolving credit facility (\"Revolving A Credit Facility\") and an additional $25.0 million last out Revolving B Credit Facility (the \"Revolving B Credit Facility\" and together with the Revolving A Credit Facility, the \"Credit Facility\"). We expect to obtain the funds to pay our expenses and to satisfy our debt obligations from our operations and available resources under the Credit Facility. Our ability to meet our expenses and make these principal and interest payments as they come due, therefore, depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future, and our anticipated revenue and cash flow may not be realized, either or both of which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. If we do not have enough funds, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing debt, sell assets or borrow more funds, which we may not be able to\naccomplish on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our existing debt service obligations, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt agreements, which may not be successful.\nOur total outstanding debt under our ABL Credit Agreement, the Second Lien Notes, including MIP Notes, and local credit facility has an aggregate principal amount of $324.3 million as of December 31, 2019. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our future financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Therefore, we may not be able to maintain or realize a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments, capital expenditures or potentially accretive acquisitions, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous borrowing covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity.\nOur debt instruments impose significant operating and financial restrictions, which may prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities and taking certain actions and our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt instruments could result in an event of default that could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur debt agreements impose, and future debt agreements may impose, operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness, or issue disqualified capital stock;\n\u2022pay dividends, redeem subordinated debt or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022make certain investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022grant or permit certain liens on our assets;\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022merge, consolidate or transfer substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022create or permit restrictions on dividends, loans, asset transfers or other distributions to us from certain of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022transfer, sell or acquire assets; and\n\u2022change the business we conduct.\nThese covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs, withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, engage in or expand business activities, including future opportunities that may be in our interest, and plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness. If a default occurs, in certain circumstances, the relevant lenders or holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare the indebtedness, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that indebtedness. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our debt obligations and may not be able to continue our operations as planned.\nOur future operating results are impacted by the volatility of the prices and supply of metals, which could cause our results to be adversely affected.\nThe availability and prices we pay for metal raw materials and the prices we charge for products may fluctuate depending on many factors, including general economic conditions (both domestic and international), competition, production levels, import tariffs, duties, and other trade restrictions, geo-political health and safety issues,and currency fluctuations. To the extent metal prices decline, we would generally expect lower sales, pricing and\npossibly lower operating income. Depending on the timing of the price changes and to the extent we are not able to pass on to our customers any increases in our metal raw materials prices, our operating results may be adversely affected. In addition, because we maintain substantial inventories of metals in order to meet short lead-times and the just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers, a reduction in our selling prices could result in lower profitability or, in some cases, losses, either of which could adversely impact our ability to remain in compliance with certain provisions of our debt instruments, as well as result in us incurring impairment charges.\nOur common stock is traded on the OTCQX\u00ae Best Market (the \u201cOTCQX\u201d), which could have an adverse impact on the market price and liquidity of our common stock and could involve additional risks compared to being listed on a national securities exchange.\nThe Company\u2019s Common Stock is traded on the OTCQX under the ticker \u201cCTAM\u201d. The trading of our common stock in the OTC market rather than a national securities exchange may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders. Securities traded in the OTC market generally have less liquidity due to factors such as the reduced number of investors that will consider investing in the securities, the reduced number of market makers in the securities, and the reduced number of securities analysts that follow such securities. As a result, holders of shares of our common stock may find it difficult to resell their shares at prices quoted in the market or at all.\nFurthermore, because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in our common stock that could occur, the share price of our common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the markets perception of our business, and announcements made by us, our competitors, or parties with whom we have business relationships.\nBecause our common stock trades on the OTCQX, in some cases, we may be subject to additional compliance requirements under applicable state laws in the issuance of our securities. The lack of liquidity in our common stock may also make it difficult for us to issue additional securities for financing or other purposes, or to otherwise arrange for any financing we may need in the future. Accordingly, we urge that extreme caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in our common stock.\nOwnership of our stock is concentrated, which may limit stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters.\nThe Company\u2019s ownership is concentrated among a small group of institutional investors and the Company\u2019s management team. Certain directors, their affiliates, and/or any other concentrated ownership interests may have the voting power to substantially affect or control the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate matters. Such a concentration of control could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or prevent a change in control or other business combinations that might be beneficial to us.\nThe lender under our Credit Facility and/or the holders of our Second Lien Notes can require us to repay our debt obligations following a change of control. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy such cash obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $127.8 million of borrowings under our Credit Facility and $193.7 million of aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Second Lien Notes, including $2.3 million of MIP Notes. Upon the occurrence of a change in control (as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) or a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture for the Second Lien Notes), which in either case includes the acquisition of more than 50% of our outstanding voting power by a person or group, we may be required to repay all borrowings under the Credit Facility and/or repurchase some or all of the Second Lien Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Second Lien Notes being repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy such cash obligations and, in such circumstances, may not be able to arrange the necessary financing on favorable terms or at all. In addition, our ability to satisfy such cash obligations will be restricted pursuant to covenants contained in the indenture for the Second Lien Notes and will be permitted to be paid only in limited circumstances. We may also be limited in our ability to satisfy such cash obligations by applicable law or the terms of other instruments governing our indebtedness. Our inability to make any cash payments that may be required to satisfy the obligations described above would trigger an event of default under the Second Lien Notes, which in turn could constitute an event of default under our other outstanding indebtedness, thereby potentially resulting in the acceleration of certain of such indebtedness, the prepayment of which could further restrict our ability to satisfy such cash obligations.\nHolders of our Second Lien Notes may convert their Second Lien Notes into common stock at any time or in connection with a fundamental change. The conversion of our Second Lien Notes into common stock will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders.\nPursuant to the terms of the Second Lien Notes Indenture, we may elect to settle any election to convert Second Lien Notes in cash, common stock or a combination of both, however, our debt instruments currently limit our ability to pay cash in respect of the Second Lien Notes. Any issuance by us of our common stock upon conversion of our Second Lien Notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders. In addition, any such issuance of common stock could have a dilutive effect on our net income per share to the extent that the average stock price during the period is greater than the conversion prices and exercise prices of the Second Lien Notes. Furthermore, any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Second Lien Notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nWe have various mechanisms in place that may prevent a change in control that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable.\nWe are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the \u201cMGCL\u201d) that prohibit us from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of five years after the date of the transaction in which the person first becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d unless the business combination or stockholder interest is approved in a prescribed manner. The application of these and certain other provisions of our charter or the MGCL could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe provisions of our debt instruments also contain limitations on our ability to enter into change of control transactions. In addition, the repurchase rights in our Second Lien Notes triggered by the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture for the Second Lien Notes), and the additional shares of our common stock by which the conversion rate is increased in connection with certain fundamental change transactions, as described in the indenture for the Second Lien Notes, could discourage a potential acquirer.\nWe service industries that are highly cyclical and impacted by international regulatory concerns, and any downturn in our customers\u2019 industries could reduce our revenue and profitability.\nMany of our products are sold to customers in industries that experience significant fluctuations in demand based on economic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand, availability of adequate credit and financing, customer inventory levels, changes in governmental policies and/or regulations and other factors beyond our control, such as acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters or public health issues or pandemics. As a result of this volatility in the industries we serve, when one or more of our customers\u2019 industries experiences a decline, we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability if we are not able to divert sales of our products to customers in other industries. Historically, we have made a strategic decision to focus sales resources on certain industries, specifically the aerospace, heavy equipment, machine tools and general industrial equipment industries. A downturn in these industries has had, and may in the future continue to have, an adverse effect on our operating results. We are also particularly sensitive to market trends in the manufacturing sectors of the North American economy and the two primary global markets which we serve, aerospace and industrial.\nFor example, two recent commercial aircraft accidents led to the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max aircraft in March 2019 by the Federal Aviation Administration and other international regulatory bodies. While our overall participation on the 737 MAX program is relatively limited both through direct sales and through our customer base, certain of our aerospace customers have significant content on the aircraft. The grounding of the aircraft has caused deliveries of that aircraft to be lower than expected in fiscal year 2019, and has therefore impacted our customers, in some cases significantly. Based on information currently available, we believe when the aircraft returns to service these missed deliveries will be fulfilled in future periods. Additionally, because Boeing sources large quantities of metal directly from mills for certain of its programs, including the 737 MAX, there could be impacts on our suppliers and market availability of certain products as a result of excesses or shortages. In 2019, we do not believe the grounding had a negative impact on our sales demand or pricing. Further, as stated above, our direct exposure to the 737 MAX is relatively limited, and therefore, we do not expect it to have a significant direct impact on sales demand or pricing of our products in 2020. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that these impacts could affect our aerospace end markets more broadly than the specific 737 MAX program, and thus could negatively impact our profitability and/or cash flow.\nOur industry is highly competitive, which may force us to lower our prices and may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe principal markets that we serve, aerospace and industrial, are highly competitive. Competition is based principally on price, service, quality, processing capabilities, inventory availability and timely delivery. We compete in a highly fragmented industry. Competition in the various markets in which we participate comes from a large number of value-added metals processors and service centers on a regional and local basis, some of which have greater financial resources than we do and some of which have more established brand names in the local markets we serve. We also compete to a lesser extent with primary metals producers who typically sell to very large customers requiring shipments of large volumes of metal. Increased competition could force us to lower our prices or to offer increased services at a higher cost to us, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur operating results are subject to the seasonal nature of our customers\u2019 businesses.\nA portion of our customers experience seasonal slowdowns. Historically, our revenues in the months of July, November, and December have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of shipping days and holiday or vacation closures for some customers. Dependent on market and economic conditions, our sales in the first two quarters of the year, therefore, can be higher than in the third and fourth quarters due to this seasonality. As a result, analysts and investors may inaccurately estimate the effects of seasonality on our operating results in one or more future quarters and, consequently, our operating results may fall below expectations.\nAn impairment or additional restructuring charge could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce costs and improve operating performance. These actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to asset impairments, employee termination costs, charges for pension benefits, and pension settlement and/or curtailments, which could be significant and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a significant amount of long-lived assets. We review the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever significant events or changes occur which might impair the recovery of recorded costs, making certain assumptions regarding future operating performance. The results of these calculations may be affected by the current demand and any decline in market conditions for our products, as well as interest rates and general economic conditions. If impairment is determined to exist, we will incur impairment losses, which may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nDisruptions or shortages in the supply of raw materials could adversely affect our operating results and our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\nOur business requires materials that are sourced from third party suppliers. If, for any reason, our primary suppliers of metals should curtail or discontinue their delivery of raw materials to us at competitive prices and in a timely manner, our operating results could suffer. Unforeseen disruptions in our supply bases, including those resulting from competition, political instability, acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, and public health issues or pandemics, among other things, could materially impact our ability to deliver products to customers. The sourcing of certain metals may be highly competitive due to limited supplies and availability. The number of available suppliers could be reduced by factors such as industry consolidation and bankruptcies affecting metals producers, or suppliers may be unwilling or unable to meet our demand due to industry supply conditions. If we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of raw materials from our traditional suppliers, we may not be able to obtain such raw materials from alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedules, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results. To the extent we have quoted prices to customers and accepted orders for products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials, or have existing contracts, we may be unable to raise the price of products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials to our customers.\nIn some cases the availability of raw materials requires long lead times. As a result, we may experience delays or shortages in the supply of raw materials. If we are unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of required raw materials, we may be unable to timely supply customers with sufficient quantities of products. This could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs, or suffer harm to our reputation, all of which may adversely affect our operating results.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\") is limited.\nWe have incurred substantial losses since 2008. As of December 31, 2019, we had United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) federal net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of $12.3 million. The U.S. federal NOLs will expire in various years\nbeginning with 2034. These U.S. federal NOLs reflect the attribute reduction for the cancellation of indebtedness resulting from our bankruptcy proceedings in 2017, as well as the write-off of the statutorily limited losses, which the Company will never be able to utilize due to Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) section 382 limitations. We have determined that an ownership shift of greater than fifty percent occurred in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and as such, a significant portion of the pre-ownership shift NOLs are subject to an annual utilization limitation under IRC section 382 that will act to prevent the Company from utilizing most of its losses against future taxable income. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership that we cannot predict or control that could result in further limitations being placed on our ability to utilize our federal NOLs. In addition, we may not generate future taxable income so that we can use our available NOLs as an offset. As of December 31, 2019, we have a full valuation allowance against our federal and state NOLs that we do not expect to utilize under IRC section 382 as we have concluded, based on all available evidence, that it is more likely than not that we will not utilize these federal and state NOLs prior to their respective expiration.\nChanges in United States tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition.\nLegislative or regulatory measures by the U.S or non-U.S. governments, rules and interpretations under the current tax law, further changes in corporate tax rates, the realizability of the deferred tax assets and/or liabilities relating to our U.S. operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses (such as executive compensation) contained in tax legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets and/or liabilities, could result in significant charges in the current or future taxable years, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense. Furthermore, changes to the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings could change our future intentions regarding the reinvestment of such earnings. The foregoing items could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition.\nIncreases in freight and energy prices would increase our operating costs and we may be unable to pass these increases on to our customers in the form of higher prices, which may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe use energy to process and transport our products. The prices for and availability of energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions, which are affected by political, economic and regulatory factors beyond our control. Our operating costs increase if energy costs, including electricity, diesel fuel and natural gas, rise. During periods of higher freight and energy costs, we may not be able to recover our operating cost increases through price increases without reducing demand for our products. In addition, we typically do not hedge our exposure to higher freight or energy prices.\nWe operate in international markets, which expose us to a number of risks.\nAlthough a majority of our business activity takes place in the United States, we serve and operate in certain international markets, which exposes us to political, economic and currency related risks, including the following:\n\u2022currency exchange risk;\n\u2022changes in tariffs, duties and taxes;\n\u2022limitations on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022restrictions on imports and exports or sources of supply;\n\u2022transportation delays or interruptions;\n\u2022political, social and economic instability and disruptions;\n\u2022acts of terrorism or war, natural disasters and other public health issues or pandemics;\n\u2022potential for adverse change in the local political or social climate or in government policies, laws and regulations; and\n\u2022difficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations and the application of foreign labor regulations.\nIn addition to the United States, we operate in Canada, Mexico, France, Singapore, and China. An act of war, terrorism, public health issues or a major pandemic event could disrupt international shipping schedules, cause additional delays in importing or exporting products into or out of any of these countries, including the United States,\nor increase the costs required to do so. In addition, acts of crime or violence in these international markets could adversely affect our operating results. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies could reduce the value of these assets as reported in our consolidated financial statements, which could reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity. If we do not adequately anticipate and respond to these risks and the other risks inherent in international operations, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nThe imposition of tariffs or duties on imported metals could significantly increase the price of the metals we purchase from international suppliers and/or result in shortages in the supply of raw materials.\nThough we source the majority of our products domestically in the countries in which we operate, we do source some products from international suppliers. The imposition of tariffs or duties on imported metals, other similar measures imposed by the U.S. government, and retaliatory/corresponding measure by other countries, has a pervasive impact on the metals market in which we operate. For example, we may be unable to pass through the higher costs to our customers for the metals we buy internationally, which could adversely impact our competitiveness, financial condition and operating results. Similarly, further decreases in imports could cause a disruption or shortage in the availability of the raw materials that we buy, which could limit our ability to meet customer's demand or to purchase material at competitive prices. This could cause us to lose sales, incur additional costs, or suffer harm to our reputation, all of which may adversely affect our operating results.\nA portion of our workforce is represented by collective bargaining units, which may lead to work stoppages.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 18% of our U.S. employees were represented by the USW under collective bargaining agreements, including hourly warehouse employees at our distribution centers in Cleveland, Ohio and Hammond, Indiana. As these agreements expire, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in concluding collective bargaining agreements with the USW to replace those that expire. Although we believe that our labor relations have generally been satisfactory, we cannot predict how stable our relationships with the USW will be or whether we will be able to meet the USW requirements without impacting our operating results and financial condition. The USW may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Work stoppages and instability in our relationship with the USW could negatively impact the timely processing and shipment of our products, which could strain relationships with customers or suppliers and adversely affect our operating results. Effective May 15, 2018, we entered into a four-year collective bargaining agreement with the USW, which covers approximately 83 employees at our largest facility in Cleveland, Ohio. Approximately 20 employees at our Hammond, Indiana facility are covered by a separate collective bargaining agreement with the USW that was renegotiated effective September 1, 2016 and expires on August 31, 2020. We plan to begin negotiations in to renew the collective bargaining agreement with the USW for employees at the Hammond, Indiana facility in early 2020.\nWe rely upon our suppliers as to the specifications of the metals we purchase from them.\nWe rely on mill or supplier certifications that attest to the physical and chemical specifications of the metals received from our suppliers for resale and generally, consistent with industry practice, do not undertake independent testing of such metals. We rely on our customers to notify us of any product that does not conform to the specifications certified by the supplier or ordered by the customer. Although our primary sources of products have been domestic suppliers, we have and will continue to purchase product from foreign suppliers when we believe it is appropriate. In the event that metal purchased from domestic suppliers is deemed to not meet quality specifications as set forth in the mill or supplier certifications or customer specifications, we generally have recourse against these suppliers for both the cost of the products purchased and possible claims from our customers. However, such recourse will not compensate us for the damage to our reputation that may arise from sub-standard products and possible losses of customers. Moreover, there is a greater level of risk that similar recourse will not be available to us in the event of claims by our customers related to products from foreign suppliers that do not meet the specifications set forth in the mill or supplier certifications. In such circumstances, we may be at greater risk of loss for claims for which we do not carry, or do not carry sufficient, insurance.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a disruption to our primary distribution hubs.\nOur largest facilities, in Cleveland (Ohio), Hammond (Indiana), and Janesville (Wisconsin) serve as primary distribution centers that ship product to our other facilities as well as external customers. Our business could be adversely impacted by a major disruption at any of these facilities due to unforeseen developments occurring in or around the facility, such as:\n\u2022damage to or inoperability of our warehouse or related systems;\n\u2022a prolonged power or telecommunication failure;\n\u2022a natural disaster, environmental or public health issue or pandemic, or an act of war or terrorism on-site.\nA prolonged disruption of the services and capabilities of these or other of our facilities could adversely impact our operating results.\nDamage to or a disruption in our information technology systems could impact our ability to conduct business and could subject us to liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws.\nDifficulties associated with the design and implementation of our enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) or other information technology systems could adversely affect our business, our customer service and our operating results.\nWe rely primarily on one information technology system to provide inventory availability to our sales and operating personnel, improve customer service through better order and product reference data and monitor operating results. Difficulties associated with upgrades or integration with new systems could lead to business interruption that could harm our reputation, increase our operating costs and decrease profitability. In addition, any significant disruption relating to our current information technology systems, whether resulting from such things as fire, flood, tornado and other natural disasters, power loss, network failures, loss of data, security breaches and computer viruses, or otherwise, may have an adverse effect on our business, our operating results and our ability to report our financial performance in a timely manner.\nWe could be vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations on our indebtedness, which could hurt our operating results.\nWe are exposed to various interest rate risks that arise in the normal course of business. Market risk arises from changes in interest rates. We currently finance our operations with both fixed rate and variable rate borrowings, and the fair market value of our $219.4 million of fixed rate borrowings may be impacted by changes in interest rates. In addition, if in the future interest rates subsequently increase significantly, it could significantly increase the interest expense on our variable rate borrowings which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity.\nWe may face risks associated with current or future litigation and claims.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in a variety of lawsuits, claims and other proceedings relating to the conduct of our business. These suits concern issues including contract disputes, employment actions, employee benefits, taxes, environmental, health and safety, personal injury and product liability matters. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail on all claims made against us in the lawsuits that we currently face or that additional claims will not be made against us in the future. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending lawsuits and claims, we do not believe that the disposition of any such pending matters is likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity, although the resolution in any reporting period of one of more of these matters could have an adverse effect on our operating results for that period. Also, we can give no assurance that any other lawsuits or claims brought in the future will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or operating results.\nWe could incur substantial costs in order to comply with, or to address any violations under, environmental and employee health and safety laws, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental statutes and regulations, including laws and regulations governing materials we use and our facilities. In addition, certain of our operations are subject to international, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the air and water and establish standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Our operations are also subject to various employee safety and health laws and regulations, including those concerning occupational injury and illness, employee exposure to hazardous materials and employee complaints. Certain of our facilities are located in industrial areas, have a history of heavy industrial use and have been in operation for many years and, over time, we and other predecessor operators of these facilities have generated, used, handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes. Currently unknown cleanup obligations at these facilities, or at off-site locations at which materials from our operations were disposed, could result in future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified, but which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or operating results.\nPotential environmental legislative and regulatory actions could impose significant costs on the operations of our customers and suppliers, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAs a metals distributor, our operations do not emit significant amounts of greenhouse gas (\"GHG\"). However, the manufacturing processes of many of our suppliers and customers are energy intensive and generate carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions. Any adopted future climate change and GHG legislative or regulatory measures may impose significant costs on the operations of our customers and suppliers and indirectly impact our operations. Until the timing, scope and extent of any future legislation and regulation becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cyber and other security threats or disruptions.\nWe face various cyber and other security threats, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our sensitive information and computer networks. Unauthorized or inappropriate access to, or use of, our computer networks or systems may be intentional, unintentional or a result of criminal activity. Such unauthorized or inappropriate access may lead to the corruption of data, which could cause interruption in our operations or damage our computer systems or those of our customers or vendors. A party that is able to circumvent our security measures could also gain unauthorized access to confidential, proprietary, personal or other sensitive information or capabilities, which may belong to third parties, our employees or us.\nThe occurrence of such threats, attacks or incidents exposes us to risk of loss and possible claims brought by our customers, employees or other parties with whom we have commercial relationships, as well as actions by government regulators. In addition to potential legal liability, these activities may interfere with our ability to provide our products and services. Further, a perception that our security measures are ineffective against security incidents could damage our reputation, and we could lose employees, customers or vendors. Any of these occurrences could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThus, the success of our business depends on the security of our computer networks and systems and, in part, on the security of the computer networks and systems of our third-party vendors. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate the risk of these threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We also cannot give assurance that the security measures of our third-party vendors, including network and system providers, providers of customer and vendor support services and other vendors will be adequate. Thus, we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by such breaches.", "PERMNO": 30402, "SIC": 5051, "TIC": "CTAM"}
