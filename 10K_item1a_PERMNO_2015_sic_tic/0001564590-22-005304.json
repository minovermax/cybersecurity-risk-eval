Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the risks described below in addition to the financial and other information contained in this Annual Report, including the matters addressed under the caption \u201cCautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d If any events described by the following risks actually occur, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. This could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or other similar outbreaks of contagious diseases.\nOutbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments affecting us and/or the third parties on which we rely, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and is continuing to impact, many aspects of society, including the operation of healthcare systems, global travel, supply and labor markets and other business and economic activity worldwide. Ireland, all U.S. states, and many local jurisdictions and countries around the world have, at times during the pandemic, issued and implemented quarantines, vaccine and masking mandates, executive orders and other similar government orders, restrictions and recommendations for their residents to help control the spread of COVID-19. Such orders, mandates, restrictions and/or recommendations have, at times during the pandemic, resulted in widespread interruptions and closures of businesses, including healthcare systems that serve people living with addiction and serious mental illness, work stoppages, slowdowns and/or delays, remote work policies and travel restrictions, among other effects.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, commercial sales of the medicines from which we derive revenue- including injectable medications administered by healthcare professionals-have been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely impacted as a result of developments that have transpired, and may continue to transpire, related to this pandemic, including travel restrictions, quarantine, testing and/or vaccine mandates and other protocols, and labor shortages, many of which have contributed to limited access to, or reduced willingness to access, healthcare providers and locations where injectable medications may be administered. Further, this pandemic and measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on global economic conditions, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition, including the demand for, and ability of patients to access, our and our licensees\u2019 medicines, or our ability to obtain financing, if needed, on favorable terms or at all.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and may continue to cause, varying degrees of disruption to our employees, our communities and our business operations. While we have continued to operate our manufacturing facilities and to supply our medicines without interruption throughout the pandemic, any prolonged labor or supply chain shortages at our manufacturing facilities could impact our ability to manufacture our products and the third-party products from which we receive revenue in a timely matter or at all. In addition, while we have continued to conduct our R&D activities, including our ongoing clinical trials, the COVID-19 pandemic has, at times, impacted the timelines of certain of our early-stage discovery efforts and clinical trials, and may continue to impact such timelines while the pandemic persists. We work with our internal teams, our clinical investigators, R&D vendors and critical supply chain vendors to continually assess, and endeavor to mitigate, potential adverse impacts of COVID-19 on our manufacturing operations and R&D activities.\nIn addition, we rely upon third parties for many aspects of our business, including the provision of goods and services related to the manufacture of our clinical products and our and our partners\u2019 marketed products, the conduct of our clinical trials, and the sale of our proprietary marketed products and the marketed products of our licensees from which we receive manufacturing and/or royalty revenue. The COVID-19 pandemic has, to varying degrees, disrupted the business operations of the third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, packagers, distributors, contract research organizations, customers, clinical site investigators, community advocacy partners, and others, and may continue to do so for so long as the pandemic and its impacts persist. For example, the third-party sites and investigators involved in our clinical trials have experienced, and may continue to experience, interruptions which have impacted, and may continue to impact, the conduct of our clinical trials and our ability to complete them in a timely manner or at all. If our clinical programs are significantly delayed as a result of such impacts, there could be adverse effects on our expected timelines for regulatory review and potential approval of our product candidates. Any prolonged material disruption to these or other third parties on which we rely could negatively impact our ability to conduct business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted, and may continue to impact, the regulatory agencies with which we interact in the development, manufacture, regulatory review and commercialization of our medicines. For example, travel restrictions, social distancing, quarantine protocols and other protective measures may impact the timelines and manner in which the FDA, the HPRA and other regulatory agencies conduct regulatory activities, which may, in turn, negatively impact expected timelines for regulatory review and approval of our product candidates, which could have an adverse effect on our business and the market price for our ordinary shares.\nThe degree to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our employees, business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on the ultimate severity and duration of the pandemic and the manner in which it continues to evolve, including the emergence, prevalence and severity of new COVID-19 variants, and future developments in response thereto, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted as of the date of this Annual Report and which may include, among other things, governmental, business or other actions that have been, are being or will be taken in response to this pandemic, such as restrictions on travel and mobility, business closures and operating restrictions, the imposition of vaccine and masking mandates and/or mandatory testing protocols. We are unable to predict the impacts of the pandemic and of actions taken in response to the pandemic, on our employees, including with regard to their health, safety, wellbeing and job performance, or on the labor market and our ability to attract and retain employees; impacts of the pandemic on the vendors or distribution channels in our supply chain and on our ability to continue to manufacture and supply our products; impacts of the pandemic on the conduct of our clinical trials, including with respect to enrollment rates, availability of investigators and clinical trial sites, and monitoring of data; impacts of the pandemic on healthcare systems that serve people living with opioid dependence, alcohol dependence, schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder; impacts of the pandemic on the regulatory agencies with which we interact in the development, review, approval and commercialization of our medicines; impacts of the pandemic on reimbursement for our products, including our Medicaid rebate liability, and for services related to the use of our products; and impacts of the pandemic on the U.S., Irish and global economies more broadly.\nWe receive substantial revenue from our key proprietary products and our success depends on our ability to successfully manufacture and commercialize such products.\nSales of our proprietary products comprise an increasingly significant portion of our revenues. We developed and exclusively manufacture VIVITROL for the treatment of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence, ARISTADA for the treatment of schizophrenia, ARISTADA INITIO for initiation onto ARISTADA for the treatment of schizophrenia, and LYBALVI for the treatment of adults with schizophrenia and for the treatment of adults with bipolar I disorder, as a maintenance monotherapy or for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes, as monotherapy or an adjunct to lithium or valproate, and we exclusively commercialize these products in the U.S. Our success depends in large part on our ability to continue to successfully manufacture and commercialize such products in the complex markets into which they are sold. Any significant negative developments relating to these products could have a material adverse effect on our revenues from these products and, in turn, on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and the market price of our ordinary shares.\nWe rely heavily on our licensees in the commercialization and continued development of products from which we receive revenue and, if our licensees are not effective, or if disputes arise in respect of our contractual arrangements, our revenues could be materially adversely affected.\nOur arrangements with licensees are critical to bringing to market and/or successfully commercializing products using our proprietary technologies and from which we receive manufacturing and/or royalty revenue. We rely on these licensees in various respects, including commercializing such products, conducting development activities with respect to new formulations or new indications for such products, and/or managing the regulatory approval process for such products.\nWe earn significant royalty and/or manufacturing revenue from sales by our licensees of our licensed products and third-party products incorporating our proprietary technologies. The revenues we receive from such products depend primarily upon the success of our licensees in commercializing such products. For example, we receive substantial revenue from Janssen\u2019s sales of the long-acting INVEGA products and RISPERDAL CONSTA and from Biogen\u2019s sales of VUMERITY and FAMPYRA. We have no involvement in the commercialization efforts for these and other products sold by third parties from which we receive revenue and cannot control the extent or effectiveness of such commercialization efforts.\nDisputes may also arise between us and a licensee involving the ownership of technology developed under a license, the use of our technology, including know-how, in third-party products, the terms and amounts of royalty payments to be paid under a license, or other issues arising out of any licenses or other collaborative agreements. Such disputes may delay related development programs, impact commercialization or manufacturing activities for the related products, impact the timing or amount of revenue that we receive in respect of such products, or result in expensive arbitration, litigation or other dispute resolution, which may not be resolved in our favor and may adversely impact our financial condition. Further, certain of our license agreements may be terminated, with or without cause, or assigned in connection with a change in control, and we cannot guarantee that any of these relationships will continue or that our licensees will be able or willing to continue to perform their obligations, including development, commercialization or payment obligations, under such agreements. Any significant negative developments relating to our relationships with our licensees or our collaborative arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nFor example, in November 2021 we received notice of partial termination in the U.S. of our license agreement with Janssen related to INVEGA SUSTENNA, INVEGA TRINZA, and INVEGA HAFYERA. The basis for this termination is Janssen\u2019s assertion that it does not utilize our NanoCrystal technology licensed under the license agreement. We strongly disagree with Janssen\u2019s position and are prepared to pursue all options at our disposal to enforce our contractual rights and address any unauthorized use of our intellectual property; however, the announcement of Janssen\u2019s partial termination and expectations regarding the loss of royalty revenues from U.S. sales of such products in early 2022 resulting from such termination, caused the market price of our ordinary\nshares to decline significantly, and any actual losses of royalty revenues that result from such termination, and/or prolonged discussions, dispute resolution efforts or commercial arbitration or litigation in respect of such royalty revenues, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nFor these and other reasons that may be outside of our control, our revenues from products sold by our licensees may fall below our expectations, the expectations of our licensees or those of our shareholders, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the market price of our ordinary shares.\nWe face competition in the biopharmaceutical industry.\nWe face intense competition in the development, manufacture, marketing and commercialization of our products from many and varied sources, such as research institutions and other biopharmaceutical companies, including companies with similar technologies or medicines, and manufacturers of generic drugs. Some of these competitors are also our licensees, who control the commercialization of products from which we receive manufacturing and/or royalty revenues. For example, our proprietary products ARISTADA and LYBALVI compete with the long-acting INVEGA products and RISPERDAL CONSTA, products from which we receive manufacturing and/or royalty revenues.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by intensive research, development and commercialization efforts and rapid and significant technological change. In many cases, there are already products on the market that may be in direct competition with our commercial products or products in development. In addition, there are many companies developing generic versions of our products, or products with similar technologies to ours or for use in similar indications with whom we and our licensees compete, many of whom are larger and have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do. Other smaller or earlier stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through focused development programs and collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Some of the products being developed by our competitors are being designed to work differently than our products and may turn out to be safer or more effective than our products, which may render our products or technology platforms obsolete or noncompetitive. For a detailed discussion of the competition that we face with respect to our current marketed products, technology platforms and product indications, please see the section entitled \u201cCompetition\u201d in \u201cItem 1 - Business\u201d in this Annual Report. If we are unable to compete successfully in this highly competitive biopharmaceutical industry, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur revenues may decrease or grow at a slower than expected rate due to many factors.\nWe cannot be assured that our products will be, or will continue to be, accepted in the U.S. or markets outside the U.S. or that we will be able to maintain or increase sales of our products. Factors that may cause revenues from our products to grow at a slower than expected rate, decrease or cease all together, include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe perception of physicians and other members of the healthcare community as to our products\u2019 safety and efficacy relative to that of competing products and the willingness or ability of physicians and other members of the healthcare community to prescribe, dispense and/or administer, and patients to use, our products;\n\u2022\nunfavorable publicity concerning us, our licensees, our products, similar classes of drugs or the industry generally;\n\u2022\nthe cost-effectiveness of our products and reimbursement policies of government and third-party payers that may impact use of our products;\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability of raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our products;\n\u2022\nthe successful manufacture of our products on a timely and cost-effective basis;\n\u2022\nthe size of the markets for our products, and patient and physician satisfaction with our products;\n\u2022\nsignificant changes in the competitive landscape for our products, including any approval of generic versions of our products or other branded products that may compete with our products;\n\u2022\nadverse event information relating to our products or to similar classes of drugs;\n\u2022\nchanges to the product labels of our products, or of products within the same drug classes, to add significant warnings or restrictions on use;\n\u2022\nour continued ability to engage third parties to package and/or distribute our products on acceptable terms;\n\u2022\nthe unfavorable outcome of investigations, arbitrations, litigation or other legal proceedings, including government requests for information regarding VIVITROL, securities litigation, IP litigation, including so-called \u201cParagraph IV\u201d litigation relating to VIVITROL and other products from which we receive revenue, litigation or other proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s (the \u201cUSPTO\u201d) Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the \u201cPTAB\u201d) or its equivalent in other jurisdictions outside of the U.S., including opposition proceedings in the EU relating to RISPERDAL CONSTA and any other litigation or arbitration related to any of our products;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments and actions related to the manufacture, commercialization or continued use of our products, including FDA actions such as the issuance of a REMS or warning letter, or conduct of an audit by the FDA or another regulatory authority in which a manufacturing or quality deficiency is identified;\n\u2022\nthe extent and effectiveness of the sales, marketing and distribution support for our products, including our licensees\u2019 decisions as to the timing and volume of product orders and shipments, the timing of product launches, and product pricing and discounting;\n\u2022\ndisputes with our licensees relating to the use of our technology in, and marketing and sale of, products from which we received, or currently receive, manufacturing and/or royalty revenue and the amounts to be paid with respect to such products, including the dispute relating to our license agreement with Janssen described above;\n\u2022\nexchange rate valuations and fluctuations;\n\u2022\nU.S. and global political changes and/or instability, and any related changes in applicable laws and regulations, that may impact resources and markets for our products;\n\u2022\nthe impact that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may have on the manufacture and commercialization of our products; and\n\u2022\nany other material adverse developments with respect to the commercialization of our products.\nRevenues generated by sales of our products depend on the availability from third-party payers of reimbursement for our products and the extent of cost-sharing arrangements for patients (e.g., patient co-payment, co-insurance, deductible obligations) and cost-control measures imposed, and any reductions in payment rate or reimbursement or increases in our or in patients\u2019 financial obligation to payers could result in decreased sales of our products and/or decreased revenues.\nIn both U.S. and non-U.S. markets, sales of our products depend, in part, on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers such as state and federal governments, including Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S. and similar programs in other countries, managed care providers and private insurance plans. Deterioration in the timeliness, certainty and amount of reimbursement for our products, the existence of barriers to coverage of our products (such as prior authorization, criteria for use or other requirements), increases in our financial obligation to payers, including government payers, limitations by healthcare providers on how much, or under what circumstances, they will prescribe or administer our products or unwillingness by patients to pay any required co-payments, or deductible amounts, could reduce the use of, and revenues generated from, our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, when a new product is approved, the availability of government and private reimbursement for that product and coverage restrictions that may be imposed for such product, are uncertain, as is the amount for which that product will be reimbursed. We cannot predict the availability or amount of reimbursement for, or the prevalence and extent of other access barriers to, our products.\nIn the U.S., federal and state legislatures, health agencies and third-party payers continue to focus on containing the cost of healthcare, including by comparing the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments. Any adverse findings for our products from such comparisons may reduce the extent of reimbursement for our products. Economic pressure on state budgets may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for drugs, including but not limited to price control initiatives, discounts and other pricing-related actions. In November 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the BBBA. The BBBA includes several provisions that may impact our business, including provisions that create an out-of-pocket cap for seniors, impose new manufacturer financial liability (including in Medicare Part D), allow the U.S. government to negotiate prices for some drugs covered under Medicare Part B and Part D, require inflation rebates to limit annual increases in drug prices in Medicare and private insurance, and repeal the rebate rule that would require pass through of pharmacy benefit manager rebates to beneficiaries. While the BBBA has not yet been, and may not in its current form be, signed into law, such provisions, if enacted, could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nOver the past several years, a number of states have enacted drug pricing transparency laws that require companies to report on drug price increases and justify how drug prices were set and we expect additional state drug pricing initiatives to be proposed and enacted in the future. In addition, state Medicaid programs are increasingly requesting that manufacturers pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug. Managed care organizations continue to seek price discounts and, in some cases, to impose restrictions on the coverage of particular drugs. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid expenses may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by Medicaid programs. This may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding constraint on prices and reimbursement for our products.\nFurthermore, we may face uncertainties as a result of continued federal and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of PPACA, the outcome of existing litigation related to PPACA, and potential reforms and changes to government negotiation or regulation of drug pricing. PPACA significantly expanded coverage of mental health and substance use disorders and provided federal parity protections to such coverage benefits. If successful, such efforts and proposed legislation or other future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform and drug pricing could\nadversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn addition, the outcome or settlement of litigation could impact the practices of healthcare providers and patients, and the policies and practices of third-party payers, including Medicare, Medicaid, managed care providers and private insurance plans, in a manner detrimental to our products, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. For example, one or more defendants in the opioid multi-district litigation has offered large volumes of generic buprenorphine free of charge to state plaintiffs as settlement compensation, which, if agreed to and approved, could negatively impact state reimbursement policies, healthcare provider practices, and patient access to alternative FDA-approved medications to generic buprenorphine, which includes VIVITROL, for the treatment of opioid dependence.\nIn Europe and many other countries, government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for healthcare expenditures, including payment for drugs and biologics. We expect that countries may take actions to reduce expenditure on drugs and biologics, including mandatory price reductions, patient access restrictions, suspensions of price increases, increased mandatory discounts or rebates, preference for generic products, reduction in the amount of reimbursement and greater importation of drugs from lower-cost countries. Any such cost-control measures would likely reduce our revenues. In addition, certain countries set prices by reference to the prices in other countries where our products are marketed. Thus, the inability to secure adequate prices in a particular country may not only limit the marketing of products within that country, but may also adversely affect the ability to obtain acceptable prices in other markets.\nClinical trials for our products are expensive, may take several years to complete, and their outcomes are uncertain.\nIn order to obtain regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any products, we or our licensees must demonstrate, through preclinical testing and clinical trials, that our products are safe and effective for use in humans. Designing, conducting and completing a clinical development program is often a lengthy, time-consuming and expensive process. We have incurred, and we will continue to incur, substantial expenses for preclinical testing, clinical trials and other activities related to our clinical development programs.\nOur preclinical and clinical development efforts may take several years or more, varying substantially with the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the product and the clinical study designs and methodologies employed, and may not be successfully completed in a timely manner or at all. Timelines for the initiation, conduct and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nissues with the opening, operation or inspection of a new or ongoing clinical trial site;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures of third-party CROs and other third-party service providers and clinical investigators to manage and conduct the trials, perform oversight of the trials, including data audit and verification procedures, or to meet expected deadlines;\n\u2022\nan inability to recruit clinical trial participants at the expected rate or at all, or to adequately follow participants following treatment;\n\u2022\nunforeseen safety or tolerability issues;\n\u2022\nan inability to manufacture or obtain sufficient quantities of materials used for clinical trials;\n\u2022\nunforeseen governmental or regulatory issues or concerns, including those of the FDA, DEA and other regulatory agencies; and\n\u2022\nglobal instability, including instability relating to political events or a global pandemic or other contagious disease, such as COVID-19, in or near the countries in which we conduct our clinical trials.\nIn addition, we are currently conducting and enrolling patients in clinical studies in a number of countries where our experience is more limited. In these instances, we must depend on third parties, including independent clinical investigators, CROs and other third-party service providers, to successfully conduct our clinical trials and to audit, verify and accurately report results from such trials. Though we do not have much control over many aspects of such third-party activities, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Third parties may not complete planned activities on schedule or conduct our trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols.\nThe outcome of our clinical trials is uncertain. The results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials often have not predicted results of later clinical trials. A number of products have shown promising results in early clinical trials but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data in later clinical trials to obtain necessary regulatory approvals.\nIf a product fails to demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical trials, or if third parties fail to conduct clinical trials in accordance with their obligations, the development, approval and commercialization of our products may be delayed or prevented, and such events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nPreliminary, topline or interim data from our clinical trials that we may announce, publish or report from time to time may change as more patient data become available or based on subsequent audit and verification procedures, and may not be indicative of final data from such trials, data from future trials or real-world results.\nFrom time to time, we may announce, publish or report preliminary, topline or interim data from our clinical trials, including those we are conducting in oncology. Such data are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patients continue progressing through the study (for example, in oncology studies, a patient may progress from a complete or partial response to progressive disease), as patient enrollment continues and/or as more patient data become available, and such data may not be indicative of final data from such trials, data from future trials or real-world results. In addition, such data may remain subject to audit confirmation and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary, topline or interim data disclosed. As a result, all preliminary, topline and interim data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Material adverse differences between preliminary, topline or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe FDA or other regulatory agencies may not agree with our regulatory approval strategies or components of our filings for our products and may not approve, or may delay approval of, our products.\nWe must obtain government approvals before marketing or selling our products. The FDA in the U.S., and comparable regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions, impose substantial and rigorous requirements for the development, manufacture and commercialization of medicines, the satisfaction of which can take a significant number of years and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product.\nIn addition, regulation is not static, and regulatory agencies, including the FDA, evolve in their staff, interpretations and practices and may impose more stringent requirements than currently in effect, which may adversely affect our plans for product development, manufacture and/or commercialization. The approval procedure and the time required to obtain approval also varies among countries. Regulatory agencies may have varying interpretations of the same data, and approval by one regulatory agency does not ensure approval by regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions. In addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may choose not to communicate with or update us during clinical testing and regulatory review periods and the ultimate decision by the FDA or other regulatory agencies regarding drug approval may not be consistent with prior communications.\nThe product approval process can last many years, be very costly and still be unsuccessful. Regulatory approval by the FDA or other regulatory agencies can be delayed, limited or not granted at all for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\na product may not demonstrate safety and efficacy for each target indication in accordance with applicable regulatory agencies\u2019 standards;\n\u2022\ndata from preclinical testing and clinical trials may be interpreted by applicable regulatory agencies in different ways than we or our licensees interpret it;\n\u2022\nregulatory agencies may not agree with our or our licensees\u2019 regulatory approval strategies, plans for accelerated development timelines, components of our or our licensees\u2019 filings such as clinical trial designs, conduct and methodologies, or the sufficiency of our or our licensees\u2019 submitted data to meet their requirements for product approval;\n\u2022\nregulatory agencies might not approve our or our licensees\u2019 manufacturing processes or facilities, or those of the CROs and contract manufacturing organizations who conduct research or manufacturing work on our or our licensees\u2019 behalf;\n\u2022\nfailure by our clinical investigational sites and the records kept at such sites, including any clinical trial data, to be in compliance with the FDA\u2019s GCP, or EU legislation governing GCP, or to pass FDA, EMA or EU member state inspections of clinical trials;\n\u2022\nregulatory agencies may change their requirements for approval or post-approval marketing; and\n\u2022\nadverse medical events during the trials could lead to requirements that trials be repeated or extended, or that a program be terminated or placed on clinical hold, even if other studies or trials relating to the program are successful.\nIn addition, disruptions at the FDA and other regulatory agencies that are unrelated to our company or our products, including those relating to COVID-19 or other political or economic conditions, could cause delays to the regulatory approval process for our products. In June 2020, the FDA noted that it was continuing to ensure timely review of applications for medical products during the COVID-19 pandemic in line with its user fee performance goals; however, if a prolonged U.S. government shutdown occurs as a result of political or economic conditions or if the COVID-19 pandemic increases in severity or impact, the FDA\u2019s ability to timely review and process regulatory submissions could be significantly impacted.\nAny failure to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory approval for our products will prevent or delay their commercialization and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, any failure to obtain, or delay in obtaining, approval for our products could have a material impact on our shareholders\u2019 confidence in the\nstrength of our development capabilities and/or our ability to generate significant revenue from our development program and could result in a significant decline in our share price.\nThe FDA or other regulatory agencies may impose limitations or post-approval requirements on approvals for our products.\nEven if regulatory approval to market a product is granted by the FDA or other regulatory agencies, the approved label for the product may not be consistent with our initial expectations or commercial plans. For example, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may impose limitations on the clinical data that may be included in the label for the product or the indicated uses for which, or the manner in which, the product may be marketed, or may impose additional post-approval requirements, such as a REMS, with which we would need to comply in order to maintain the approval of such product. Our business could be seriously harmed if we do not complete these post-approval requirements and, as a result, the FDA or other regulatory agencies require us to change the label for such product, or if such post-approval requirements significantly restrict the marketing, sale or use of such product.\nFurther, if a product for which we obtain regulatory approval is a controlled substance, it will not become commercially available until after the DEA provides its final schedule designation for the product, which may take longer and may be more restrictive than we expect or may change after its initial designation. In addition, a final designation that is more restrictive than we expect could adversely affect our ability to commercialize such product and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIn addition, legislation and regulatory policies relating to post-approval requirements and restrictions on promotional activities for pharmaceutical products, or FDA, DEA or other regulatory agency regulations, guidance or interpretations with respect to such legislation or regulatory policy, may change, which may impact the development and commercialization of our products.\nWe are subject to risks related to the manufacture of our products.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products is a highly complex process in which a variety of difficulties may arise from time to time. We have in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated interruptions or delays in manufacturing through our internal or external supply chain and resources. Such disruptions can occur for many reasons, including, but not limited to, the supply and quality of API, drug product and other product components and any potential shortages of such materials; regulatory actions; failures relating to materials, manufacturing equipment or processes, quality deviations or safety issues, vendor error, operator error, labor shortages or disputes, utility or transportation disruptions, or physical or electronic security breaches; site-specific incidents (such as fires), environmental incidents, natural disasters and other severe weather events, including those that may occur as a result of climate change , or global disruptions such as the current global pandemic; and many other factors.\nAny such problems with manufacturing processes, whether at our facilities or those of our licensees or other third parties that manufacture or package products or components of products on our behalf, could result in product defects or shortages, manufacturing failures or products not being manufactured to their applicable specifications, which could require us to delay shipment of products or recall products previously shipped, or could impair our ability to receive regulatory approval for a product, commercially launch a product, expand into new markets or supply products in existing markets. We may not be able to resolve any such issues in a timely manner, or at all, which could result in declines in sales and reputational damage as well as significant remediation costs to address any issues that arise.\nWe rely solely on our manufacturing facility in Wilmington, Ohio for the manufacture of RISPERDAL CONSTA, VIVITROL, ARISTADA, ARISTADA INITIO and LYBALVI and on our manufacturing facility in Athlone, Ireland for the manufacture of AMPYRA, FAMPYRA, VUMERITY, other products using our NanoCrystal or OCR technologies and certain of our other products in development. Due to regulatory and technical requirements, we have limited ability to shift production among our facilities or to outsource any portions of our manufacturing to third parties in the event of an interruption in manufacturing or demand for manufacturing that exceeds our capacity at the applicable facility. Any need to shift production among our facilities or transition our manufacturing processes, or portions thereof, to a third party, whether due to an interruption in our manufacturing or to demand for a product that exceeds our manufacturing capacity, could take a significant amount of time and money, may not be successful, and could cause significant delay in our ability to supply product.\nAny interruption in supply, whether resulting from issues with equipment, materials, personnel, manufacturing processes, or internal or external quality audits or reviews, could result in delays in meeting our contractual obligations and could damage our relationships with our licensees, including the loss of manufacturing and supply rights and/or revenues.\nOur manufacturing facilities also require specialized personnel and are expensive to operate and maintain. Any interruption in manufacturing, delay in a regulatory approval or commercial launch, or recall or suspension of sales of products manufactured in our facilities, may cause operating losses as we continue to operate these facilities and retain the required specialized personnel. In addition, any significant personnel shortages at our manufacturing facilities, whether temporary or prolonged, including shortages resulting from impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related mandates, testing protocols or restrictions, or shortages related to the labor market more broadly, may cause significant interruptions to our manufacturing facilities and to our supply of products.\nWe are also dependent in certain cases on third parties who manufacture or distribute certain products from which we receive revenue. Supply or manufacturing issues related to such products could materially and adversely affect sales of such products, and in\nturn our revenue from such products.\nWe rely on third parties to provide goods and services in connection with the manufacture and distribution of the products we manufacture.\nWe rely on third parties for the timely supply of goods and services that play a role in our manufacturing activities, including, among others, specified raw materials, equipment, contract manufacturing, formulation and packaging services, storage and product distribution services, customer service activities and product returns processing, and some of these goods and services for our products are currently only available from a single source or a limited number of qualified sources. Although we actively manage these third-party relationships to ensure continuity, quality and compliance with applicable regulations, events beyond our control could result in the complete or partial failure of these goods and services. Any such failure could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe manufacture of products and product components, including the procurement of bulk drug product and other materials used in the manufacture, packaging, storage and distribution of our products, requires successful coordination among us and multiple third-party providers. Lack of capacity available at such third-party providers or any other issues with the quality or operations of these third-party providers, including any issues related to regulatory permits, audits or requirements, could require us to delay shipment of saleable products, recall products previously shipped or impair our ability to supply products at all.\nWe endeavor to qualify and register new vendors and to develop contingency plans so that production is not materially impacted by third-party provider issues. Nonetheless, any such third-party provider issues could increase our costs, cause us to lose revenue or market share and damage our reputation, and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIn addition, we rely heavily on the three largest pharmaceutical wholesalers in the U.S. market-Cardinal Health Inc., AmerisourceBergen Corp. and McKesson Corp-in the distribution of the products that we market and sell in the U.S. If we are unable to maintain our business relationships with these wholesalers on commercially acceptable terms, if the buying patterns of these wholesalers fluctuate due to seasonality or any other reason or if wholesaler buying decisions or other factors outside of our control change, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we or our third-party providers fail to meet the stringent requirements of governmental regulation in the manufacture of our products, we could incur substantial remedial costs and a reduction in sales and/or revenues.\nWe and the third-party providers that play a role in our manufacturing activities are generally required to comply with cGMP regulations and other applicable non-U.S. standards in the manufacture of our products or components of our products. In addition, in the U.S., the DEA and state-level agencies heavily regulate the manufacturing, holding, processing, security, recordkeeping and distribution of substances, including controlled substances. If any of our products or components of our products are scheduled by the DEA as controlled substances, we would be subject to such DEA regulations. We and our third-party providers are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA, the DEA and comparable U.S. state and non-U.S. agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm compliance with all applicable laws. Any changes to our suppliers or modifications of methods of manufacturing require submission of amendments to our NDAs or other marketing applications to the FDA or other applicable regulatory agencies, and ultimate acceptance by such agencies of such amendments, prior to release of product to the applicable marketplace. Our inability or the inability of our third-party providers to demonstrate ongoing compliance with cGMP or other regulatory requirements could require us to withdraw or recall products and interrupt clinical and commercial supply of our products. Any delay, interruption or other issues that may arise in the manufacture, formulation, packaging or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or operations or the facilities or operations of third-party providers to pass any regulatory agency inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop, obtain and maintain regulatory approval of, and commercialize or supply, products. This could increase our costs, cause us to lose revenue or market share and damage our reputation with our collaboration partners or in the market generally.\nIn March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\u201cCARES\u201d) Act was signed into law in the U.S., and served to increase the FDA\u2019s existing authority with respect to drug shortage measures. Under the CARES Act, for each facility where marketed products for certain serious diseases or conditions are manufactured, or where components of such products are manufactured, we are required to have a risk management plan in place that identifies and evaluates risks to the supply of such products or product components, which plans may be subject to review during any FDA inspection. Each of our facilities operates in accordance with a comprehensive quality management system, which includes risk assessment, preventive actions and regular review of inventory levels for each of the marketed products that we manufacture; however, there is no guarantee that the FDA will consider our risk management program to be sufficient upon inspection or that we will not experience shortages in the supply of marketed products that we manufacture, which could materially adversely affect the patients who rely on such marketed products and our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. The FDA and various regulatory agencies outside the U.S. have inspected and approved our commercial manufacturing facilities. However, we cannot guarantee that the FDA or any other regulatory agencies will approve any other facility that we or our third-party providers may operate or, once approved, that any of these facilities will remain in compliance with cGMP and other regulations. Any third party we use to manufacture bulk drug product for use in the U.S. must be licensed by the FDA and, for controlled substances, the DEA. Failure by us or our third-party\nproviders to gain or maintain regulatory compliance with and approvals from the FDA or other regulatory agencies could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAdverse market conditions may exacerbate certain risks inherent to our business, including risk of payment from licensees and customers and reimbursement for our products.\nAdverse market conditions may cause disruptions or delays to our business or to the businesses of third parties from whom we receive revenues, or reductions in the availability or extent of reimbursement available to us. For example, we depend on our licensees and customers for substantial portions of our revenue, and the contracts with our licensees and customers pursuant to which we supply product, or under which we are eligible for certain development or sales milestones or royalties related to products that incorporate our proprietary technologies, may not be secured by collateral or other security. Accordingly, we bear the risk that our licensees may not be able to pay amounts due to us under such contracts.\nIn addition, as a result of adverse market conditions, organizations that provide reimbursement for use of our products, such as government health administration authorities and private health insurers, may be unable to satisfy such reimbursement obligations or may delay payment. In addition, U.S. federal and state health authorities may reduce the extent of their reimbursements (including Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements in the U.S.) or payments, and private insurers may increase their scrutiny of claims. If such licensees or other third parties are unable or unwilling to pay amounts owed to us or satisfy their commitments to us, or if there are reductions to such payments or commitments, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur success largely depends upon our ability to attract, recognize and retain key personnel.\nOur ability to compete and succeed in the highly competitive biopharmaceutical industry and in the disease states in which we market and sell products depends largely upon our ability to attract, recognize and retain highly skilled technical, scientific, manufacturing, management, regulatory, compliance and selling and marketing personnel. Each of our executive officers and all of our employees are employed \u201cat will,\u201d meaning we or each officer or employee may terminate the employment relationship at any time. We face intense competition for employees, due, among many factors, to the geographic locations in which we operate and the competitive benefits and compensation practices in our industry, and in recent years, new competition as employees are increasingly able to work remotely. Government vaccine or masking mandates, testing protocols, or other restrictions that apply to us may have an impact on employee performance, retention and recruitment, particularly for those employees who perform essential tasks in our laboratories and manufacturing facilities and cannot perform their jobs remotely. The loss of key personnel due to any of these factors or our inability to hire and retain personnel who have technical, scientific, manufacturing, management, regulatory, compliance or commercial backgrounds could materially adversely impact our business, including the achievement of our manufacturing, research and development, commercial, financial and other operational and strategic business objectives.\nThe increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges.\nSocial media is increasingly being used as a means of corporate communications and for purposes of social networking and commentary. We are increasingly using social media tools to communicate certain information about our business, our employees, our company values and corporate responsibility initiatives, to support disease state education in our areas of focus, and to provide information about our products or development programs. Despite our efforts to monitor evolving social media guidance and to comply with applicable rules, regulations and regulatory guidance relating to social media, such practices are evolving and not always clear. There is a risk that the use of social media by us or our employees to communicate about our products or business may cause us to be found in violation of applicable requirements and could result in regulatory actions or legal claims against us related to off-label marketing or other prohibited activities. In addition, our employees may knowingly or inadvertently engage on social media in ways that may not comply with our social media policy or other legal, contractual or regulatory requirements, which may give rise to liability, lead to the loss of trade secrets and other intellectual property, or result in public disclosure of personal information of our employees, clinical trial patients, customers, and others. In addition, negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us or our products on any social media platforms could damage our reputation, brand image and goodwill. If such disclosures were to occur, there is a risk that we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or that we may not be able to defend the Company or the public\u2019s legitimate interests due to restrictions on what we may say about our products or our business. Any of these events, if they were to occur, could cause us to incur liability, face overly restrictive regulatory actions or suffer reputational or other harm to our business\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nPatent and other IP protection for our products is key to our business and our competitive position but is uncertain.\nReceiving and maintaining patent and/or trademark protection for our products and technologies, including those that are subject to our licensing arrangements, maintaining our trade secrets, not infringing the proprietary rights of others, and preventing others from infringing our proprietary rights are each key to our success and our competitive position.\nPatent protection provides rights of exclusivity for the term of the patent. We are able to protect our proprietary rights from\nunauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. In this regard, we try to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the U.S. and elsewhere related to our proprietary product inventions and improvements that are important to our business and products. Our pending patent applications, together with those we may file in the future, or those we may license to or from third parties, may not result in patents being issued. Even if issued, such patents may not provide us with sufficient proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products or technology. Because the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies involve complex legal and factual questions, enforceability of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. The ultimate degree of patent protection that will be afforded to products and processes, including ours, and those of our licensees, in the U.S. and in other important markets, remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the patent offices, courts and lawmakers in these countries. The development of new technologies or products may take a number of years, and there can be no assurance that any patents which may be granted in respect of such technologies or products will not have expired or be due to expire by the time such products are commercialized, or that such patents will successfully withstand any challenges during their respective terms.\nAlthough we make reasonable efforts to protect our IP rights and to ensure that our proprietary technology does not infringe the rights of third parties, we cannot ascertain the existence of all potentially conflicting IP claims. Therefore, there is a risk that third parties may make claims of infringement against our products or technologies. If patents exist or are issued that cover our products or technologies, we may not be able to manufacture, use, offer for sale, sell or import such products without first getting a license from the patent holder. The patent holder may not grant us a license on reasonable terms, or it may refuse to grant us a license at all. This could delay or prevent us from developing, manufacturing, selling or importing those of our products that would require the license. Claims of IP infringement may also require that we redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products. Even if we have an agreement that may serve to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot, or do not, license the infringed technology on reasonable terms or at all, or substitute similar technology from another source, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nPatents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As our products achieve greater commercial sales, potential competitors are more likely to seek to challenge our patents. The laws of certain countries may not protect our IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and any patents that we own or license from others may not provide any protection against competitors. In addition, in the case of certain of our licensed products or products incorporating our licensed technology, our licensees are responsible for prosecuting, maintaining, enforcing and defending the IP related to the product(s) from which we derive revenue. Their failure to secure, maintain, enforce and defend this IP could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, know-how and inventions, which are not protected by patents, to maintain our competitive position. We try to protect this information by entering into confidentiality agreements with parties that have access to it, such as our licensees, licensors, contract manufacturers, potential business partners, employees and consultants. However, any of these parties may breach such agreements and may disclose our confidential information, or our competitors might learn of the information in some other way. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use IP owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. If any trade secret, know-how or other invention not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor, such event could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nUncertainty over IP in the biopharmaceutical industry has been the source of litigation, which is inherently costly and unpredictable, could significantly delay or prevent approval or negatively impact commercialization of our products, and could adversely affect our business.\nThere is considerable uncertainty within the biopharmaceutical industry about the validity, scope and enforceability of many issued patents in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. We cannot currently determine the ultimate scope, validity and enforceability of patents which may be granted to third parties in the future or which patents third parties may assert are infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of our products.\nStemming in part from this uncertainty, there has been, and we expect that there may continue to be, significant litigation and an increasing number of inter partes reviews (\u201cIPRs\u201d) and administrative proceedings in the pharmaceutical industry regarding patents and other IP rights. A patent holder might file an IPR, interference and/or infringement action against us, including in response to patent certifications required under the Hatch-Waxman Act, claiming that certain claims of one or more of our issued patents are invalid or that the manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale or import of our products infringed one or more of such party\u2019s patents. We may have to expend considerable time, effort and resources to defend such actions, and litigation may be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights.\nIn addition, we may need to enforce our IP rights against third parties who infringe our patents and other IP or challenge our patents, patent applications or trademark applications. Litigation and trial proceedings, such as so-called Paragraph IV litigation and IPRs, concerning patents and other IP rights may be expensive, protracted and distracting to management, with no certainty of\nsuccess. As a result, we may at times give up certain rights with respect to our IP in order to avoid or resolve timely and costly IP litigation or IPR proceedings. For example, in July 2019, in order to resolve an IPR instituted by Amneal with the PTAB, we granted Amneal a non-exclusive license under certain patents covering VIVITROL, including the latest to expire patent covering VIVITROL in the U.S., to market and sell a generic formulation of VIVITROL in the U.S. beginning sometime in 2028 or earlier under certain circumstances. Ultimately, the outcome of such litigation and proceedings, or any settlement arrangement with respect thereto, could adversely affect our business and the validity and scope of our patents or other proprietary rights or delay or prevent us from manufacturing and marketing our products.\nWe or our licensees may face claims against IP rights covering our products and competition from generic drug manufacturers.\nIn the U.S., generic manufacturers of innovator drug products may file ANDAs and, in connection with such filings, certify that their products do not infringe the innovator\u2019s patents or that the innovator\u2019s patents are invalid. This often results in litigation between the innovator and the ANDA applicant. This type of litigation is commonly known in the U.S. as \u201cParagraph IV\u201d litigation.\nFor example, Teva entities filed an ANDA seeking approval to engage in the commercial manufacture, use or sale of a generic version of VIVITROL and alleging that one of our Orange-Book patents related to VIVITROL is invalid, unenforceable and/or will not be infringed by Teva\u2019s proposed product. In September 2020, we initiated a Paragraph IV lawsuit against Teva to dispute such claims.\nAlthough we intend to vigorously defend our IP rights, and we expect our licensees to do the same, there can be no assurance that we or our licensees will prevail. Our and our licensees\u2019 existing patents could be invalidated, found unenforceable or found not to cover generic forms of our or our licensees\u2019 products. If Teva or other ANDA filers were to receive FDA approval to sell generic versions of our products or the products from which we receive revenue and/or prevail in any patent litigation with respect to such products, such products would become subject to increased competition, and our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Regulatory or Legal Matters\nLitigation or arbitration filed against Alkermes, including securities litigation, or actions (such as citizens petitions) filed against regulatory agencies in respect of our products, may result in financial losses, harm our reputation, divert management resources, negatively impact the approval of our products, or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nWe are, and may in the future become, involved in various legal proceedings, including those asserting violations of securities and/or fraud and abuse laws and those asserting claims related to product liability, intellectual property and/or contractual arrangements. Such proceedings may include claims for, or the possibility of, damages or fines and penalties involving substantial amounts of money or other relief, including but not limited to civil or criminal fines and penalties. Such legal proceedings and the preparation therefor may result in substantial costs to us and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which in turn could harm our business. Moreover, if any of such legal proceedings were to result in an adverse outcome, such outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe have been, and may continue to be, the subject of certain government inquiries or requests for documentation. For example, we have received a subpoena and civil investigative demands from U.S. state and federal authorities for documents related to VIVITROL. We are cooperating with the government in each instance. If, as a result of government requests, proceedings are initiated, including under the U.S. federal anti-kickback statute and False Claims Act and state False Claims Acts or other laws, and we are found to have violated one or more applicable laws, we may be subject to significant liability, including without limitation, civil fines, criminal fines and penalties, civil damages and exclusion from U.S. federal funded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and may be required to enter into a corporate integrity or other settlement with the government, any of which could materially affect our reputation, business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Conduct giving rise to such liability could also form the basis for private civil litigation by third-party payers or other persons allegedly harmed by such conduct. In addition, if any of our existing business practices, including those of our sales force, are challenged as unlawful, we may have to change those practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nFurther, our liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to satisfy, or may not cover, any expenses or liabilities that may arise. Additionally, regardless of whether or not there is merit to the claims underlying any lawsuits or government inquiries of which we are subject, or whether or not we are found as a result of such lawsuits or inquiries to have violated any applicable laws, such lawsuits and inquiries can be expensive to defend or respond to, may divert the attention of our management and other resources that would otherwise be engaged in managing our business, and may further cause significant and potentially irreparable harm to our public reputation.\nWe have been, and may again be, the subject of citizen petitions that request that the FDA refuse to approve, delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements on our NDAs. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the NDA in question. Even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while\nit considers and responds to the petition, or may impose additional approval requirements as a result of such petition. These outcomes and others could adversely affect our share price as well as our ability to generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of our products and products using our proprietary technologies.\nThe clinical study or commercial use of our products may cause unintended side effects or adverse reactions, or incidents of misuse may occur, which could adversely affect our products, business and share price.\nWe cannot predict whether the clinical or commercial use of our products will produce undesirable or unintended side effects that have not been evident in the use of, or in clinical trials conducted for, such products to date. The administration of drugs in humans carries the inherent risk of product liability claims whether or not the drugs are actually the cause of an injury. Our products may cause, or may appear to have caused, injury or dangerous drug interactions, and we may not learn about or understand those effects until the products have been administered to study participants or patients for a prolonged period of time. Additionally, incidents of product misuse may occur.\nThese events, among others, could result in product recalls or additional regulatory controls (including additional regulatory scrutiny, REMS programs, and requirements for additional labeling) or product liability actions. As our development activities progress and we continue to have commercial sales, our product liability insurance coverage may be inadequate to satisfy liabilities that arise, we may be unable to obtain adequate coverage at an acceptable cost or at all, or our insurer may disclaim coverage as to a future claim. This could prevent or limit the development or commercialization of our products. In addition, the reporting of adverse safety events involving our products, including instances of product misuse, and public rumors about such events could cause our product sales or share price to decline or experience periods of volatility. These types of events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIf there are changes in, or we fail to comply with, the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the healthcare industry, we could face costs, penalties and business losses.\nOur activities, and the activities of our licensees and third-party providers, are subject to extensive government regulation. Government regulation by various national, state and local agencies includes detailed inspections of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, marketing and promotion, adverse event reporting, sampling, distribution, recordkeeping, storage, and disposal practices. Achieving compliance with these regulations substantially increases the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approvals to market newly developed and existing products. Government regulatory actions, including audits, records requests and inspections of manufacturing facilities, can result in delay in the release of products, seizure or recall of products, suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for the manufacture and sale of products, and other regulatory enforcement actions, including the levying of civil fines or criminal penalties, the issuance of a warning letter, or the imposition of an injunction. Biopharmaceutical companies also have been the target of government lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of government regulation, including claims asserting submission of incorrect pricing information, impermissible off-label promotion of pharmaceutical products, payments intended to influence the referral of healthcare business, submission of false claims for government reimbursement, antitrust violations and violations related to environmental matters.\nWhile we have implemented numerous risk mitigation measures, we cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our licensees, our consultants or our contractors are, or will be, in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations or interpretations of the applicability of these laws to our products, operations and marketing practices. If we or our agents fail to comply with any of those laws, regulations or interpretations, a range of actions could result, including the suspension or termination of clinical trials, the failure to approve a product, restrictions on sales of our products or our manufacturing processes, withdrawal of our products from the market, significant fines, exclusion from government healthcare programs or other sanctions or litigation.\nChanges affecting the healthcare industry, including new laws, regulations or judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or decisions, related to patent protection and enforcement, access to healthcare, environmental issues or product pricing and marketing, could also adversely affect our revenues, our public reputation or our potential to be profitable. For example, the costs of prescription pharmaceuticals in the U.S. have been the subject of considerable discussion in the U.S. and the government may seek to address such costs through new legislative and/or administrative measures. Such changes in laws, regulations or decisions or in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and decisions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur business involves environmental, health and safety risks.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and chemicals and is subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and to periodic inspections for possible violations of these laws and regulations. Under certain of these laws and regulations, we could be liable for any contamination at our current or former properties or third-party waste disposal sites. In addition to significant remediation costs, contamination can give rise to third-party claims for fines, penalties, natural resource damages, personal injury and damage (including property damage). The costs of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and\nregulations are significant. We have developed and implemented a proprietary risk mitigation program to preemptively identify and address environmental, health, safety and security risks; however, there can be no assurance that a violation of current or future environmental, health or safety laws or regulations will not occur. Any violations, even if inadvertent or accidental, or the cost of compliance with any resulting order, fine or liability that may be imposed, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition and Tax Matters\nWe may not become profitable on a sustained basis.\nAt December 31, 2021, our accumulated deficit was $1.5 billion, which was primarily the result of net losses incurred from 1987, the year Alkermes, Inc., was founded, through December 31, 2021, partially offset by net income over certain fiscal periods.\nOur ability to achieve sustained profitability in the future will depend on our ability to grow and diversify our revenue and effectively and efficiently manage our costs. Factors that may impact our future revenue, and in turn our future profitability, include our or our licensees\u2019 (as applicable) ability to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully commercialize VIVITROL, the ARISTADA product family, LYBALVI, VUMERITY, RISPERDAL CONSTA, the long-acting INVEGA products, FAMPYRA and any other marketed products for which we earn revenue in the countries in which such products are approved;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully develop, and obtain and maintain regulatory approval for, products both in the U.S. and in other countries;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully manufacture our products and third-party products efficiently and in a cost-effective manner;\n\u2022\nobtain adequate reimbursement coverage for our products and third-party products from insurance companies, government programs and other third-party payers;\n\u2022\nachieve certain product development and sales milestones under our collaborative arrangements; and\n\u2022\nresolve favorably any commercial disputes that may arise in respect of collaborative arrangements from which we receive revenues.\nFactors that may impact our future spend, and in turn our future profitability, include:\n\u2022\nthe scope of our research and development activities, including the number of products, indications or new technologies that we may pursue, and our ability to share development costs through potential collaborations;\n\u2022\nthe time and expense required to pursue FDA and/or other regulatory approvals for our products;\n\u2022\nthe time and expense required to prosecute, enforce, defend and/or challenge patent and other IP rights;\n\u2022\nthe costs of operating and maintaining our manufacturing and research facilities;\n\u2022\nthe costs of doing business with third-party vendors, including suppliers, manufacturers, packagers and distributors;\n\u2022\nthe cost of possible licenses or acquisitions of technologies, compounds or product rights or the potential acquisition of other assets, including equipment, facilities or businesses;\n\u2022\nthe costs related to potential litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings or government requests for information;\n\u2022\nthe costs of defending against potential or actual proxy contests or other activist shareholder actions; and\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with recruiting, compensating and retaining a highly skilled workforce in an environment where competition for such employees is intense.\nCertain U.S. holders of our ordinary shares may suffer adverse tax consequences if any of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are characterized as a \u201ccontrolled foreign corporation\u201d.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. This legislation significantly changed U.S. tax law by, among other things, changing the rules which determine whether a foreign corporation is treated for U.S. tax purposes as a controlled foreign corporation (\u201cCFC\u201d) for taxable years ended December 31, 2017 and onwards. The impact of this change on certain holders of our ordinary shares is uncertain and could be adverse, including potential income inclusions and reporting requirements for U.S. persons (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) who are treated as owning (directly or indirectly) at least 10% of the value or voting power of our shares. The determination of CFC status is complex and includes attribution rules, the application of which are not entirely certain. These changes to the attribution rules relating to the determination of CFC status make it possible that one or more of our non-U.S. subsidiaries will be classified as a CFC. Existing and prospective investors should consult their tax advisers regarding the potential application of these rules to their investments in us.\nSee \u201cCertain Irish and United States Federal Income Tax Considerations - United States Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d in our Form S-1/A, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2012, for additional discussion with respect to other potential U.S. federal income tax consequences of investments in us.\nIf goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we could have to take significant charges against earnings.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $74.0 million of amortizable intangible assets and $92.9 million of goodwill. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\u201cGAAP\u201d), we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets have been impaired. Amortizing intangible assets will be assessed for impairment in the event of an impairment indicator. Any reduction or impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and shareholders\u2019 equity in future periods.\nOur effective tax rate may increase.\nAs a global biopharmaceutical company, we are subject to taxation in a number of different jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places that we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of these places. Our effective tax rate may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the distribution of our profits or losses between the jurisdictions where we operate and differences in interpretation of tax laws. In addition, the tax laws of any jurisdiction in which we operate may change in the future, which could impact our effective tax rate. Tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate may audit us. If we are unsuccessful in defending any tax positions adopted in our submitted tax returns, we may be required to pay taxes for prior periods, interest, fines or penalties, and may be obligated to pay increased taxes in the future, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nChanges in tax rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, may adversely affect our financial condition.\nEffective January 1, 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct R&D expenses in the year incurred and instead requires taxpayers to capitalize, and subsequently amortize such expenses over five years for research activities conducted in the U.S. and over fifteen years for research activities conducted outside of the U.S. As such, we expect a material decrease in cash flows provided from operations and a material increase in our net deferred tax assets over these amortization periods. The actual impact of this change will depend on multiple factors, including the amount of R&D expenses incurred and whether the research activities are performed within or outside of the U.S.\nUnless the U.S. Department of the Treasury issues regulations that narrow the application of this provision to a smaller subset of our R&D expenses or the provision is deferred, modified or repealed by the U.S. Congress, there will be a material increase in our U.S. income tax liability over these amortization periods.\nOur deferred tax assets may not be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $81.8 million of net deferred tax assets in the U.S. Included in this amount was approximately $1.7 million of U.S. federal net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards and $38.5 million of research and development tax credit carryforwards that can be used to reduce U.S. taxable income or offset federal tax in future periods. These carryforwards will expire within the next twenty years. It is possible that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, especially if we incur losses in the U.S. in the future. Losses may arise from unforeseen operating events, an enlarged foreign derived intangible income deduction due to the capitalization of R&D expenses, or the occurrence of significant excess tax benefits arising from the exercise of stock options and/or the vesting of restricted stock units. Unless we are able to generate sufficient taxable income in the future, a substantial valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our U.S. deferred tax assets may be required, which would materially increase our expenses in the period the valuation allowance is recognized and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, we have included within our U.S. net deferred tax assets of $81.8 million an amount of $36.1 million relating to employee share-based compensation expense. It is possible that a material portion of this deferred tax asset will not be realized, especially if the price of our ordinary shares remains at its current level (refer to \u201cItem 5 - Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d in this Annual Report for details of the price of our ordinary shares). Unless the price of our ordinary shares increases, we will incur a deferred tax expense as our U.S.-based employees exercise or forfeit their stock options and their restricted stock unit awards vest. This could materially increase our tax expense and may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe business combination in 2011 of Alkermes, Inc. and the drug technology business (\u201cEDT\u201d) of Elan Corporation, plc may limit our ability to use our tax attributes to offset taxable income, if any, generated from such business combination.\nOn September 16, 2011, the businesses of Alkermes, Inc. and EDT were combined under Alkermes plc (this combination is referred to as the \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d). For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a corporation is generally considered tax resident in the place of its incorporation. Because we are incorporated in Ireland, we should be deemed an Irish corporation under these general rules. However, Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) generally provides that a corporation organized outside the U.S. that acquires substantially all of the assets of a corporation organized in the U.S. will be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes if shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation own at least 80% (of either the voting power or the value) of the stock of the acquiring foreign corporation after the acquisition by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation, and the \u201cexpanded affiliated group\u201d (as defined in Section 7874) that includes the acquiring corporation does not have substantial business activities in the country in which it is organized.\nIn addition, Section 7874 provides that if a corporation organized outside the U.S. acquires substantially all of the assets of a corporation organized in the U.S., the taxable income of the U.S. corporation during the period beginning on the date the first assets are acquired as part of the acquisition, through the date which is ten years after the last date assets are acquired as part of the acquisition, shall be no less than the income or gain recognized by reason of the transfer during such period or by reason of a license of property by the expatriated entity after such acquisition to a foreign affiliate during such period, which is referred to as the \u201cinversion gain,\u201d if shareholders of the acquired U.S. corporation own at least 60% (of either the voting power or the value) of the stock of the acquiring foreign corporation after the acquisition by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation, and the \u201cexpanded affiliated group\u201d of the acquiring corporation does not have substantial business activities in the country in which it is organized. If this rule was to apply to the Business Combination, among other things, Alkermes, Inc. would have been restricted in its ability to use the approximately $274.0 million of U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and $38.0 million of U.S. state NOL carryforwards that it had as of March 31, 2011. We do not believe that either of these limitations should apply as a result of the Business Combination. However, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) could assert a contrary position, in which case we could become involved in tax controversy with the IRS regarding possible additional U.S. tax liability. If we were to be unsuccessful in resolving any such tax controversy in our favor, we could be liable for significantly greater U.S. federal and state income tax than we anticipate being liable for through the Business Combination, which would place further demands on our cash needs.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business.\nIn March 2021, we amended and refinanced our existing term loan (the \u201c2023 Term Loans\u201d), in order to, among other things, provide for a new class of replacement term loans equal to $300.0 million; extend the due date of the loan from March 26, 2023 to March 12, 2026; amend the interest payable from LIBOR plus 2.25% with no LIBOR floor to LIBOR plus 2.50% with a LIBOR floor of 0.5%; and increase covenant flexibility (such refinancing, the \u201cTerm Loan Refinancing\u201d and the 2023 Term Loans as so amended and refinanced the \u201c2026 Term Loans\u201d). The 2026 Term Loans were also amended to include customary Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) hardwired benchmark replacement language. As of December 31, 2021, our borrowings consisted of $295.8 million outstanding under the 2026 Term Loans.\nThe 2026 Term Loans are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the combined company assets and properties of Alkermes plc and most of its subsidiaries, which serve as guarantors. The agreements governing the 2026 Term Loans include a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, and subject to certain exceptions and baskets, impose operating and financial restrictions on us.\nOur failure to comply with these restrictions or to make these payments could lead to an event of default that could result in an acceleration of the indebtedness. Our future operating results may not be sufficient to ensure our ability to make our debt payments or to remedy any such default. In the event of an acceleration of this indebtedness, we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments.\nDiscontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR, or uncertainty related to the potential for any of the foregoing, may adversely affect us.\nIn 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced its intention to phase out LIBOR after 2023. Currently, it is anticipated that LIBOR will be completely phased out by June 30, 2023. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the ARRC, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, has proposed a new index calculated by short term repurchase agreements, backed by U.S. Treasury securities, called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as an alternative to LIBOR for use in contracts that are currently indexed to U.S. dollar LIBOR and has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR. On July 29, 2021, the ARRC formally recommended SOFR as its preferred alternative replacement rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR. The 2026 Term Loans contain customary ARRC hardwired benchmark replacement language to transition from LIBOR to SOFR. The discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation, reform or replacement may negatively impact the volatility of LIBOR rates, liquidity, or our access to funding required to operate our business.\nOur business strategy may involve future transactions which may harm the market price of our ordinary shares or require us to seek additional funds, and such funding may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all and may cause dilution to our existing shareholders.\nIn order to achieve our business strategy, we regularly review potential transactions related to technologies, products or product rights, and businesses that are complementary to our business, including mergers and acquisitions, licenses and collaborations, and development and supply, commercialization or co-promotion arrangements, among others. We may choose to enter into one or more of these or other transactions at any time, which may cause substantial fluctuations in the market price of our ordinary shares. Moreover, depending upon the nature of any transaction, we may experience a charge to earnings, which could also materially adversely affect our results of operations and could harm the market price of our ordinary shares.\nIn order to finance such transactions, we may require additional funds, and we may seek such funds through various sources, including debt and equity offerings, corporate collaborations, bank borrowings, arrangements relating to assets, monetization of royalty streams or other financing methods or structures. The source, timing and availability of any financings will depend on global economic conditions, credit and financial market conditions, interest rates and other factors. If we issue additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, our shareholders will suffer dilution of their investment, and it may adversely affect the market price of our ordinary shares. In addition, under Irish law, the directors of an Irish public limited company must have specific authority, as approved by the company\u2019s shareholders, to allot and issue any ordinary shares (other than pursuant to employee equity plans) and, if such directors desire to allot and issue ordinary shares for cash, such shares must first be offered on the same or more favorable terms to the company\u2019s existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis, unless this statutory pre-emption right is disapplied by approval of the company\u2019s shareholders. In May 2017, our shareholders authorized our Board to issue ordinary shares up to our maximum authorized but unissued share capital and to issue such ordinary shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis; however, in accordance with Irish law, these share issuance authorities may only be granted for a maximum of five years, at which point they lapse unless renewed by our shareholders. If we are unable to obtain renewal of these existing share issuance authorities from our shareholders, or are otherwise limited by the terms of new share issuance authorities approved by our shareholders, our ability to use our authorized but unissued share capital to effect or to fund acquisition or other transaction opportunities, or to otherwise raise capital, could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, future investors or lenders may demand, and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing shareholders. If we issue additional debt securities, our existing debt service obligations will increase further. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash to meet these obligations and need to use existing cash or liquidate investments in order to fund our debt service obligations or to repay our debt, we may be forced to curtail our operations. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available from any of these sources when needed or, if available, will be on acceptable terms. If we fail to obtain additional capital when we need it, we may not be able to execute our business strategy successfully and may have to give up rights to our product platforms, and/or products, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nCurrency exchange rates may affect revenues and expenses.\nWe conduct a large portion of our business in international markets. For example, we derive a majority of our RISPERDAL CONSTA revenues and all of our FAMPYRA, XEPLION and TREVICTA revenues from sales in countries other than the U.S., and these sales are denominated in non-U.S. dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d) currencies. We also incur substantial operating costs in Ireland and face exposure to changes in the exchange ratio of the USD and the euro arising from expenses and payables at our Irish operations that are settled in Euro. Our efforts to mitigate the impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates may not be successful. As a result, currency fluctuations among our reporting currency, USD, and the currencies in which we do business will affect our results of operations, often in unpredictable ways. See \u201cItem 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d in this Annual Report for additional information relating to our foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nIf we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our ability to meet our reporting obligations and the trading price of our ordinary shares could be negatively affected.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, a material weakness increases the risk that the financial information we report contains material errors.\nWe regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies. In addition, we are required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to report annually on our internal control over financial reporting. Any system of internal controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. If we, or our independent registered public accounting firm, determine that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective, or we discover areas that need improvement in the future, these shortcomings could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results, and the price of our ordinary shares could be negatively affected.\nIf we cannot conclude that we have effective internal control over our financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified opinion regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could lead to a decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares. Failure to comply with reporting requirements could also subject us to sanctions and/or investigations by Nasdaq or the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nRisks Related to our Ordinary Shares\nThe market price for our ordinary shares has been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future, and could decline significantly.\nThe market price for our ordinary shares has fluctuated significantly from time to time. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the closing price of our ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market ranged from $18.21 to $32.13 per share. The market price of our ordinary shares is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and industry factors, our results of operations, our ability to maintain and increase sales of our products, the success of our key development programs, our ability to achieve profitability, and other factors, including the risk factors described in this Annual Report. The stock market in general, including the market for biopharmaceutical companies, has experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, negative publicity regarding pricing and price increases by pharmaceutical companies, and potential legislation to regulate drug pricing, has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the market for biopharmaceutical companies. These broad market and industry factors have harmed, and in the future may seriously harm, the market price of our ordinary shares, regardless of our operating performance. We have also experienced significant volatility in the market price of our ordinary shares based on our business performance, including in relation to our commercial sales and the financial guidance that we issue for such sales, results from our clinical development programs, and events relating to regulatory actions and interactions related to our product candidates and commercial products. For example, a series of adverse actions by the FDA in 2018 relating to our NDA for ALKS 5461, our investigational product for the treatment of major depressive disorder, caused the market price of our ordinary shares to decline significantly.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist shareholders.\nProxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders have been waged against many companies in our industry over the last several years. Activist shareholders may agitate, either publicly or privately, for changes to a company\u2019s board of directors, management, structure, spend or strategic direction, among other things. Such actions may cause significant disruption to a company\u2019s operations and cause a company to expend a significant amount of time and resources in responding to their requests.\nIn late 2020 and early 2021, we engaged in extensive dialogues with two distinct activist shareholders, resulting in our entry into an agreement with each activist in which we agreed on certain matters relating to our Board and, in the case of one of the agreements, affirmed our commitment to, and plans for, meeting financial profitability targets over a multi-year period. These discussions resulted in the expenditure of significant time and energy by management and our Board and required dedication by the Company of significant resources. We have undertaken, and will continue to implement, several initiatives in order to drive profitability and value creation for our shareholders, but there is no assurance that we will achieve such objectives, or that such achievement and the measures we have taken and will continue to take will decrease the likelihood of activist shareholder engagement in the future. In addition, in January 2022, we received notice from one of these shareholders of its intent to nominate two directors to our Board at our 2022 annual general meeting of shareholders. We have engaged, and plan to continue to engage, with this shareholder in respect of these nominations.\nIf faced with a proxy contest or other shareholder action or request, we may not be able or willing to respond successfully to the contest, action, or request, which could be significantly disruptive to our business. Even if we are successful, our business could be adversely affected by any proxy contest or activist shareholder action or request involving us because:\n\u2022\nresponding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting operations and diverting the attention of management and employees, and can lead to uncertainty;\n\u2022\nperceived uncertainties as to the future direction of the Company or its business may result in the loss of potential acquisitions, collaborations or in-licensing opportunities, and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners; and\n\u2022\nif individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our strategic plan in a timely manner and create additional value for our shareholders.\nAny such activist shareholder contests, actions or requests, or the mere public presence of activist shareholders among our shareholder base, could cause the market price for our ordinary shares to experience periods of significant volatility.\nRisks Related to Information Security and Data Privacy\nInformation security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including IP, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and partners, as well as personally identifiable information of patients, clinical trial participants and employees. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has required us to implement, and to adapt over time, global remote work flexibility for certain of our employees who are able to work remotely. Our partners and third-party providers also possess certain of our sensitive data. The secure maintenance of all such information and the secure performance of our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems are critical to our operations and business strategy.\nAs the dependency on our IT systems increases, the confidentiality, integrity and availability of systems and the data that they store is critical to managing our business. While we take prudent measures to secure our IT systems, the risk still exists that such systems may become compromised by successful breaches, malfeasance, human error or technological fault. Certain types of attacks or breaches on our IT systems or infrastructure may go undetected for a prolonged period. Although to our knowledge we have not experienced any material incident or interruption to date, any breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or breach of our, our partners\u2019 or our third-party providers\u2019 technology systems could compromise such IT systems and the information stored there could be accessed, modified, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen, which could result in legal claims or proceedings and liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, demands for ransom or other forms of blackmail, disruptions to our development programs or commercial operations, damage to our reputation and adverse effects on our business. We retain cybersecurity insurance to cover costs and expenses related to a breach or similar event; however, there is no guarantee that such costs and expenses would not exceed the insurance that we retain.\nWe may be subject to numerous and varying privacy and security laws, and our failure to comply could result in penalties and reputational damage.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations covering data privacy and the protection of personal information, including health information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which may affect our business. In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information. Each of these laws is subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to penalties or sanctions, including criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HIPAA.\nNumerous other countries have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information as well. The EU and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. In the EU, for example, the GDPR governs the processing of personal data. The GDPR imposes significant obligations on controllers and processors of personal data, including, high standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, robust notification requirements to individuals about the processing of their personal data, a strong individual data rights regime, mandatory data breach notifications, limitations on the retention of personal data and stringent requirements pertaining to health data, and strict rules and restrictions on the transfer of personal data outside of the EU, including to the U.S. The GDPR also imposes additional obligations on, and required contractual provisions to be included in, contracts between companies subject to the GDPR and their third-party processors that relate to the processing of personal data. The GDPR allows EU member states to make additional laws and regulations in order to introduce further conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic, biometric or health data.\nAdoption of the GDPR increased our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and may require us to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance. Any failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and applicable national data protection laws of EU member states could lead to regulatory enforcement actions and significant administrative and/or financial penalties against us (fines of up to \u20ac20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher), and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 76736, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ALKS"}
