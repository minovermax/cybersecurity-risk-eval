RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves significant risks inherent to the Company\u2019s business. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed. These risks are not the only ones we may face. Other risks of which we are not aware, including those which relate to the banking and financial services industry, in general, and us, in particular, or those which we do not currently believe are material, may harm our future business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Readers should carefully consider the following important risks in conjunction with other information in this Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, in evaluating us, our business and an investment in our securities.\nThe Company may incur losses if it is unable to successfully manage interest rate risk\nThe Company\u2019s profitability depends, in substantial part, upon the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans and interest rates paid on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. These rates are normally in line with general market rates and rise and fall based on management\u2019s view of our financing and liquidity needs. The Company may selectively pay above-market rates to attract deposits as it has done in some of the Company\u2019s marketing promotions. Changes in interest rates will affect the Company\u2019s operating performance and financial condition in diverse ways including the pricing of securities, loans and deposits, which in turn may affect the growth in loan and deposit volume. The Company\u2019s net interest income will be adversely affected if market interest rates change so that the interest it pays on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest earned on loans and investments. The Company\u2019s net interest spread depends on many factors that are partly or entirely outside its control, including competition, federal economic, monetary and fiscal policies, and economic conditions generally. Fluctuations in market rates are neither predictable nor controllable and may have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial conditions, and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by economic conditions in our market area\nBecause our market area is concentrated in the Richmond, Virginia metropolitan area, we will be affected by the general economic conditions in this area. Changes in local economy may influence the growth rate of our loans and deposits, the quality of the loan portfolio, and loan and deposit pricing. A significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment, or other factors beyond our control would impact our local economy and the demand for banking products and services. Management allocates significant resources to mitigate and respond to risks associated with current economic conditions, however, such conditions cannot be predicted or controlled. A downturn in local economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Company faces substantial competition that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s growth and/or operating results\nWe face vigorous competition from other banks and financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, savings banks, finance companies, and credit unions for deposits, loans, and other financial services in our market area. A number of these institutions are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater access to capital and other resources, as well as larger lending limits and branch systems, and offer a wider array of banking services. We may face a competitive disadvantage because of our smaller size, smaller asset base, lack of geographical diversification and inability to spread our marketing costs across a broader market. If we have to raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on loans to compete effectively, our net interest margin and income could be negatively affected. Failure to compete effectively to attract new or to retain existing customers may reduce or limit our margins and our market share and may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and growth.\nCompliance with new and existing laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance may adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nWe are subject to numerous laws, regulations and supervision from both federal and state agencies. During the past few years, there has been an increase in legislation related to and regulation of the financial services industry. We expect this increased level of oversight to continue. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in financial, structural, and operational penalties. In addition, establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations may increase our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.\nLaws and regulations are generally intended to benefit customers, borrowers, and depositors, not shareholders. The legislative and regulatory environment is beyond our control, may change rapidly and unpredictably, and may negatively influence our revenue, costs, earnings, and capital levels. Our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new laws and regulations.\nThe Company\u2019s concentration in loans secured by real estate may adversely affect earnings due to changes in the real estate markets\nThe Company offers a variety of secured loans. Most of the Company\u2019s loans are secured by real estate (both residential and commercial) in its market area. At December 31, 2014, 85.73% of the Company\u2019s $481.8 million total loan portfolio was secured by residential and commercial real estate. Changes in the real estate market, such as deterioration in market value of collateral, or declines in local employment rates or economic conditions could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to pay these loans which in turn impact the Company\u2019s profitability. In addition, if the value of real estate serving as collateral materially declines, a significant portion of the loan portfolio could become under-collateralized. In the event of foreclosure, the Company may not be able to realize the amount of collateral that was anticipated at the time of loan origination which could also impact the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIf our allowance for loan losses becomes inadequate, our results of operations may be adversely affected\nMaking loans is an essential element of our business. The risk of nonpayment is affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to: the duration of the credit; credit risks of a particular customer; changes in economic and industry conditions; and in the case of collateralized loans, risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of such collateral. Although we seek to mitigate risks inherent in lending by adhering to specific underwriting practices, our loans may not be repaid. While we strive to carefully monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may become nonperforming, at any time there are loans included in the portfolio that will result in losses but have not yet been identified as nonperforming or potential problem loans. We cannot be sure that we will be able to identify deteriorating loans before they become nonperforming assets or that we will be able to limit the losses on those loans that are identified. We attempt to maintain an appropriate allowance for loan losses to provide for potential losses in our loan portfolio. Our allowance for loan losses is determined by analyzing historical loan losses, current trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, current economic conditions that may affect a borrower\u2019s ability to repay and the value of collateral, changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio and industry information. Because any estimate of loan losses is necessarily subjective and the accuracy of any estimate depends on the outcome of future events, we face the risk that charge-offs in future periods will exceed our allowance for loan losses and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s focus on the small to mid-sized, community-based businesses may increase its credit risk\nWe target our commercial development and marketing strategy primarily to serve the banking and financial services needs of small and medium-sized businesses. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. Any deterioration in a borrower\u2019s business may hinder the borrower\u2019s ability to repay his loans with the Company, which could have a material, adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Basel III capital framework contains stringent capital and liquidity requirements\nThe Company and the Bank are each subject to capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital which each must maintain. From time to time, regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking agencies have established stricter capital requirements and leverage limits for banks and bank holding companies that are based on the Basel III regulatory capital reforms. If the Company and the Bank fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and/or other regulatory requirements, the Company\u2019s financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s operations rely on certain external vendors\nExternal vendors provide key components of the Company\u2019s business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, internet connections and network access. Although the Company has selected these vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problem caused by these vendors, including poor performance of services, failure to provide services, disruptions in service, and failure to handle current or higher activity volumes could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products and services to its customers and otherwise conduct its business and may harm our reputation. As such, use of such external vendors creates an unavoidable, inherent risk to the Company\u2019s business operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations may be adversely affected by cyber security risks\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees in systems and networks. The secure processing, maintenance and use of this information is critical to our operations. The Company has invested in accepted technologies and continually reviews processes and practices that are designed to protect its networks, computers and data from damage or unauthorized access. Despite these security measures, the Company\u2019s computer systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. A breach of any kind could compromise systems and the information stored there could be accessed, damaged, or disclosed. Any such breach in information security could result in monetary losses, legal claims, regulatory penalties, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business.", "PERMNO": 92094, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FCVA"}
