RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and should be carefully considered along with all of the information in this 2021 Annual Report. These risks and uncertainties, however, are not the only risks and uncertainties that we encounter in our operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. In such a case, you may lose all or part of your investment in Hertz Global's common stock or The Hertz Corporation's debt securities. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties. Any of the following risks and uncertainties could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow and may make an investment in our securities speculative or risky.\nWe believe that the following information identifies the material risks and uncertainties affecting Hertz Global and Hertz; however, the following risks and uncertainties are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us and it is possible that other risks and uncertainties might significantly affect us.\nRISKS RELATED TO COVID-19\nThe effects of the COVID-19 outbreak have been and continue to be disruptive to our vehicle rental business and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCOVID-19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have included restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Historically, we have generated a majority of our rental revenues from airport locations, which makes our rental car business sensitive to decreases in air travel. Due to travel restrictions and stay at home orders during the course of pandemic, our revenues and profitability were significantly impacted when we experienced a high level of rental cancellations and a significant decline in forward bookings due to the decreased customer demand at our airport locations. Although we believe that renting a vehicle continues to be a safe transport alternative, and we have implemented certain procedures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, we cannot predict when or if customer demand will fully return to pre-COVID-19 levels. Additionally, we have, and could continue to, experience disruptions in the supply of vehicles from vehicle manufacturers, whether due to outbreaks of COVID-19 at their manufacturing facilities, measures they take in response to COVID-19, the Chip Shortage, or otherwise.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside of our control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, changes in travel preferences and demand for both business and leisure travel, the length of time it takes for rental pricing and volume and normal economic conditions to return; and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and discretionary spending for travel. Additional future impacts may include, but are not limited to, material adverse effects on vehicle rental demand, the supply chain and availability of vehicles, our ability to execute our strategic initiatives, and our profitability and cost structure.\nIn periods that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Part I, Item 1A of this 2021 Annual Report.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nThe continued uncertainty about the duration of the negative impact from COVID-19 in our industry may disrupt our employee retention and talent management strategies and affect our business operations.\nWe develop and maintain a talent management strategy that defines current and future talent requirements (e.g., experience, skills, location requirements, timing, etc.) based on our strategic direction, coordinated recruiting and development plans across businesses and regions and considers employee mobility, centers of excellence and shared service concepts to optimize resource plans and leverage labor arbitrage.\nCOVID-19 has created uncertainty with respect to the return to the workforce which has continued beyond 2021 and affects our employee retention and talent management strategies. We may find it difficult to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to meet demand. We cannot predict with certainty how the post-COVID return to workforce measures or general labor shortages will affect our employee retention and talent management strategies. The consequences that may result from continued disruptions or a failure of our employee retention and talent management strategies can include inadequate staffing levels, inability to support our business plan, lack of key talent, declining product quality and competitive differentiation, eroding employee morale and productivity, an increase in costs or an inability to meet/maintain internal control, regulatory or other compliance-related requirements.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nThe continuing Chip Shortage has, and may continue to, cause delays in new vehicle acquisitions, which can adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreased demand for semiconductor microchips (\"Chips\") in 2020, due in part to COVID-19 and an increased use of electronic equipment that use these Chips, resulted in a severe shortage of Chips in 2021. These same Chips and microprocessors are used in a variety of automobile parts, including in the control of engines and transmissions. As a result, various automotive manufacturers have been forced to delay or stall new vehicle production, which has caused delays in us receiving new vehicles. If efforts to address the shortage of Chips by the industry and government entities are unsuccessful, there may be further delays in new vehicle production. Consequently, there is no guarantee that we can purchase a sufficient number of new vehicles at competitive prices and on competitive terms and conditions. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of new vehicles, or if we obtain less favorable pricing and other terms during the acquisition of vehicles and are unable to recover the increased costs, then our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows may be materially adversely affected. If we are unable to purchase new vehicles at competitive prices, increased maintenance costs in relation to our existing fleet may put further pressure on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to the success of our business.\nThe success of our business depends on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key personnel. If we do not succeed in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly at the management level, our ability to execute our business plan may be adversely affected, which could harm our operating results or financial condition. Competition for qualified employees is intense. Additionally, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel could be adversely affected by our having filed for bankruptcy, notwithstanding our emergence from Chapter 11. Although we actively conduct talent reviews and succession planning to be prepared, if executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated, or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner and we could experience significant declines in productivity.\nOur vehicle rental business is particularly sensitive to reductions in the levels of business and leisure travel, and reductions in travel could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nThe vehicle rental industry is particularly affected by reductions in business and leisure travel, especially with respect to levels of airline passenger traffic. Reductions in levels of air travel, whether caused by general economic conditions, airfare increases or other events, such as work stoppages, military conflicts, terrorist incidents, natural\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\ndisasters, epidemic diseases, or the response of governments to any of these events, could have a material adverse effect on demand for vehicle rentals. In particular, we derive a substantial proportion of our revenues from key leisure destinations, including Florida, California, Texas, Hawaii and New York in the U.S. and Europe internationally, and the level of travel to these destinations is dependent upon the ability and willingness of consumers to travel on vacation and the effect of economic cycles on consumers\u2019 discretionary travel, including shortages of fuel and increases or volatility in fuel costs. In 2020 as a result of COVID-19, business and leisure travel were adversely affected and our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows were materially adversely affected. Leisure travel substantially recovered beginning late in the first quarter of 2021, but business travel remains depressed compared to pre-pandemic levels. It is possible that the increased use of conferencing and collaboration technology, as well as any permanent shift towards remote work and essential-only travel, could result in a prolonged decrease in demand for business-related travel, which could materially and adversely affect demand for our rental vehicles for business travel over the long-term.\nWe face intense competition that may lead to downward pricing or an inability to increase prices.\nWe believe that price is one of the primary competitive factors in the vehicle rental market and that technology has enabled cost-conscious customers, including business travelers, to compare rates available from rental companies more easily. If we try to increase our pricing, our competitors, some of whom may have greater resources and better access to capital than us, may seek to compete aggressively on the basis of pricing. In addition, our competitors may reduce prices in order to, among other things, attempt to gain a competitive advantage, capture market share or compensate for declines in rental activity. Additionally, pricing in the vehicle rental industry is impacted by the supply of vehicles available for rent. Any significant fluctuations in the supply of rental vehicles available in the market due to unexpected changes in demand, or actions taken by our competitors, could negatively affect our pricing, operating plans or results of operations if we are unable to adjust the size of our rental fleet in response to fluctuations in supply and demand. We also compete with non-traditional companies for vehicle rental market share, including auto manufacturers, ride-hailing and car sharing companies and other competitors in the mobility industry. To the extent we do not react appropriately to our competition or optimize our revenue and pricing strategies, we may experience sub-optimal pricing, sub-optimal asset utilization, poor customer satisfaction, lost revenue and other unfavorable consequences which may materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur business is highly seasonal and any occurrence that disrupts rental activity during our peak periods could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nThe second and third quarters of the year have historically been the strongest quarters for our vehicle rental business due to increased levels of leisure travel. We seek to manage seasonal increases in demand by increasing our available fleet and staff during peak periods, although we may not always be successful in doing so. Any circumstance, occurrence or situation that disrupts rental activity during our peak periods, or our inability to effectively meet heightened demand in those periods, could have a significant and disproportionate impact on our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to accurately estimate future levels of rental activity and adjust the number, location and mix of vehicles used in our rental operations accordingly, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could suffer.\nVehicle costs typically represent our largest expense and vehicle purchases are typically made weeks or months in advance of the expected use of the vehicle. Accordingly, our business is dependent upon the ability of our management to accurately estimate future levels of rental activity and consumer preferences with respect to the mix of vehicles used in our rental operations and the location of those vehicles. If we are unable to purchase a sufficient number of vehicles, or the right types of vehicles, to meet consumer demand, we may lose revenue or market share to our competitors. If we purchase too many vehicles, our Vehicle Utilization could be adversely affected and we may not be able to dispose of excess vehicles in a timely and cost-effective manner. For example, in early 2020 and due to COVID-19, we experienced significant excess in our vehicle supply due to reduced demand which adversely affected our Vehicle Utilization. Our failure to utilize a flexible and systematic process for fleet management that\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\naccurately estimates future levels of rental activity and determines the appropriate mix of vehicles used in our rental operations may result in obsolescence and excessive aging of fleet, the inability to sell fleet at adequate prices, sub-optimal fleet utilization, increased fleet costs, lower customer satisfaction, sub-optimal fleet sizing, lost or missing fleet assets, reduced margins and cash flows and other unfavorable consequences which may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe are implementing a strategy which increases our reliance on EVs, which may not be as successful as we anticipate.\nIn October 2021, we announced new initiatives as part of a plan to significantly expand our EV rental fleet in North America. There are a number of risks associated with expanding our EV fleet, including but not limited to the inability to secure vehicle supply within the time frame we, and our customers, expect; a potential lack of adequate infrastructure to support EVs; negative publicity or negative customer reaction to any delays in EV vehicle supply or lack of infrastructure; potentially high costs associated with maintaining or repairing EVs and related infrastructure; increased risks related to the data connectivity and the technology upon which these initiatives will rely, such as unauthorized access to modify or use such technology; possible competition from other vehicle rental providers that may also implement similar strategies; and the possibility that our strategic initiatives are not as well-received by our consumer base as anticipated.\nMoreover, our recently announced investment in Tesla EVs exposes us to a number of risks related to the potential concentration of such vehicles in our fleet, including the risk that demand for Tesla vehicles by our customers may be lower than we anticipate, the inability to obtain an adequate level of supply of Tesla vehicles and any needed replacement parts for Tesla EVs due to malfunction, product recalls or use over time, and risks related to the battery cells on which Tesla EVs depend, including the safety of such products and their need to maintain and significantly grow access to battery cells. Additionally, in October 2021, we announced an exclusive partnership with Uber to make Teslas available for their drivers to rent on the Uber network in the U.S. The success of this initiative will be dependent on the factors described above.\nIn addition, the success of our initiatives depends, in part, on the economics ultimately associated with EVs, including depreciation and residual values and the cost of financing, which will impact the attractiveness of our EVs to our customers. These economics are evolving due to the developing nature of the EV market and outcomes associated with such economics that are currently unknown could materially impact the success of these initiatives. If we do not adequately address potential risks such as these, our future revenue potential may be impacted and our ability to pursue our strategic initiatives and attain profitability could be compromised.\nWe may fail to adequately respond to changes in technology, customer demands and market competition.\nOur industry has recently been characterized by rapid changes in technology innovation and deployment to address evolving customer demands, improve operational efficiency and disrupt competitive dynamics. Examples include addressing increasing expectations of personalized, efficient and mobile-first experiences across services; optimizing maintenance costs, improving vehicle utilization and maximizing the costs of asset ownership; and enabling traditional and non-traditional competitors to introduce new transportation offerings, consumption models and vehicle platforms, including electric and autonomous vehicles and other potentially disruptive technologies. Our ability to continually improve our technology platforms, processes and products in this environment is essential to maintain a competitive position in customer satisfaction, market share and other areas. Due to natural complexity in technology innovation, potentially high costs of certain initiatives, hiring and retention challenges and impacts from our financial restructuring, we may experience technical or other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development, introduction or marketing of new products or enhanced product offerings. These challenges related to emerging technology may result in loss of competitive differentiation, margin erosion, departure of key partners, declining market share, inability to achieve growth targets, inefficient or outdated service delivery platforms, loss of key customers and brand erosion, declining employee morale, inability to attract or retain key talent and other unfavorable consequences which may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nThe mix of program and non-program vehicles in our fleet, as well as declining values of our non-program vehicles, can subject us to an increased residual value risk, which could increase our costs and materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nManufacturers agree to repurchase program vehicles at a specified price or guarantee the depreciation rate on the vehicles during a specified time period. Using program vehicles in our fleet can often alleviate our residual value risk because of the terms of our agreements with the vehicle manufacturer for repurchases and guaranteed depreciation on those vehicles. Additionally, program vehicles provide flexibility because we may be able to sell certain program vehicles shortly after having acquired them at a higher value than what we could for a similar non-program vehicle at that time, which is useful in managing our peak demand for vehicles. These benefits diminish when there are fewer program vehicles in our fleet.\nWe sell our non-program vehicles through various sales channels in the used vehicle market, including auctions, dealer direct sales, retail lots through our car sales program. In October 2021, we announced a nationwide agreement with Carvana to offer online sales of non-program vehicles to digitize and modernize our retail sales process and reduce our reliance on wholesale disposition channels. Additionally, as a result of the factors that can affect the market for used vehicles described below, our agreement with Carvana may not produce the anticipated benefits of providing stable or desirable vehicle prices in the future compared to the wholesale disposition channels.\nFor non-program vehicles, there is an increased risk that the net amount realized upon the disposition of the vehicle will be less than its estimated residual value at such time. The residual values of non-program vehicles are affected by the market for used vehicles, and although the demand for used vehicles is currently high, vehicle purchases are typically discretionary for consumers and the retail market for used vehicles is subject to economic factors, such as demand, consumer interests, inventory levels, pricing of new car models, interest rates, fuel costs, tariffs and other general economic conditions. Any decrease in residual values of our non-program vehicles could result in a substantial loss on the sale of such vehicles or accelerated depreciation while we own the vehicles, which can materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to purchase adequate supplies of competitively priced vehicles or the cost of the vehicles we purchase increases, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nOur vehicle purchase strategies can be affected by commercial, economic, market and other conditions, including a reduction of supply from auto manufacturers and any rebates or other incentives offered by them for our purchases. Purchases of vehicles from manufacturers are generally made pursuant to master agreement or framework agreements and are generally subject to potential delay or cancellation by manufacturers. Although we work with manufacturers on a continuous basis to gain a mutual understanding of their supply of, and our demand for, vehicles, the process by which we normally purchase vehicles does not always guarantee the availability of the desired vehicles on a timely basis, or provide us with remedies for any unavailability. Additionally, since 2020, auto manufacturers have faced a shortage of Chips and other digital devices used to control engines and transmissions, which has affected the availability of new vehicles being produced and our reliance on the used vehicle market, which is experiencing historically high prices, has increased. Consequently, there is no guarantee that we can purchase a sufficient number of vehicles at competitive prices and on competitive terms and conditions. If we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of vehicles, or if we obtain less favorable pricing and other terms during the acquisition of vehicles and are unable to recover from the increased costs, then our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nThe failure of a manufacturer of our program vehicles to fulfill its obligations under a repurchase or guaranteed depreciation program could expose us to losses on those program vehicles.\nIf any manufacturer of our program vehicles does not fulfill its obligations under its repurchase or guaranteed depreciation agreement with us, whether due to default, reorganization, bankruptcy or otherwise, then we would have to dispose of those program vehicles without receiving the benefits of the associated repurchase programs. In addition, we could be left with a substantial unpaid claim against the manufacturer with respect to program vehicles\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nthat were sold back to the manufacturer but not paid for, or that were sold for less than their agreed repurchase price or guaranteed value.\nThe failure by a manufacturer to pay such amounts could cause a credit enhancement deficiency under our asset-backed and asset-based financing arrangements, requiring us to either reduce the outstanding principal amount of debt or provide more collateral (in the form of cash, vehicles and/or certain other contractual rights) to the creditors under any such affected arrangement.\nIf one or more manufacturers were to adversely modify or eliminate repurchase or guaranteed depreciation programs in the future, our access to and the terms of asset-backed and asset-based debt financing could be adversely affected, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nManufacturer safety recalls could create risks to our business.\nThe Raechel and Jacqueline Houck Safe Rental Car Act of 2015 prohibits us from renting or selling vehicles with open federal safety recalls and requires us to repair or address these recalls prior to renting or selling the vehicle. If a large number of vehicles are the subject of a recall or if needed replacement parts are not in adequate supply, we may not be able to rent recalled vehicles for a significant period of time. The potential impact of a recall may be particularly severe if it impacts a model that comprises a significant proportion of our fleet, or parts that are common cross numerous model types, such as recalls of airbags in recent years. These types of disruptions could jeopardize our ability to fulfill existing contractual commitments or satisfy demand for our vehicles and could also result in the loss of business to competitors whose fleets are not similarly impacted. Depending on the severity of any recall, it could materially adversely affect, among other things, our revenues, create customer service problems, present liability claims, reduce the residual value of the recalled vehicles and harm our general reputation.\nWe rely on third-party distribution channels for a significant amount of our revenues, and the loss of access to or changes in these distribution channels could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThird-party distribution channels account for a significant amount of our vehicle rental reservations. These third-party distribution channels include traditional and online travel agencies, third-party internet sites, airlines and hotel companies, marketing partners such as credit card companies and membership organizations and global distribution systems that allow travel agents, travel service providers and customers to connect directly to our reservations systems. Loss of access to any of these channels, changes in pricing or commission structures or a reduction in transaction volume could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, liquidity and cash flows, particularly if our customers are unable to access our reservation systems through alternate channels.\nIf our customers develop loyalty to internet travel intermediaries rather than our brands, our financial results may suffer.\nCertain internet travel intermediaries, such as online travel agencies and third-party internet sites, use generic indicators of the type of vehicle (such as \u201cstandard\u201d or \u201ccompact\u201d) at the expense of brand identification and some intermediaries have launched their own loyalty programs to develop loyalties to their reservation system rather than to our brands. If the volume of sales made through internet travel intermediaries increases significantly and consumers develop stronger loyalties to these intermediaries rather than to our brands, our business and revenues could be adversely affected. Additionally, if our market share suffers due to lower levels of customer loyalty, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nDamage to our reputation or brands could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur reputation and global brands are integral to the success of our business and depend on many factors, including the quality of our products and services and the trust we maintain with our customers. Negative claims or publicity\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nregarding, among other things, our Company or our operations, offerings, practices, or customer service may damage our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue. Damage to our reputation or brands could result in a loss of customers and adversely impact our revenue and profitability. Additionally, if we fail to provide a high-quality rental experience for our customers and members, adopt new technologies or adapt to changes in the mobility industry, or otherwise meet our customer needs, there could be substantial harm to our reputation and competitiveness, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur commercial off airport leases and airport concession agreements expose us to risks.\nWe maintain a substantial network of vehicle rental locations at off airport and airport locations in the U.S. and internationally. If we are unable to continue operating these facilities at their current locations due to the termination of leases or the termination of vehicle rental concessions at airports, which comprise a majority of our revenues, our operating results could be adversely affected. These leases and concession agreements typically include minimum payment obligations that are required even if our volume significantly declines which could increase our costs as a percentage of revenues. In addition, if the costs of these leases and/or concession agreements increase and we are unable to increase our pricing structure to offset the increased costs, our financial results could suffer.\nMaintaining favorable brand recognition is essential to our success, and failure to do so could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur business is heavily dependent upon the favorable brand recognition that our \u201cHertz\u201d, \u201cDollar\u201d and \u201cThrifty\u201d brand names have in the markets in which they participate. Factors affecting brand recognition are often outside our control, and our efforts to maintain or enhance favorable brand recognition, such as marketing and advertising campaigns, may not have their desired effects. In addition, although our licensing partners are subject to contractual requirements to protect our brands, it may be difficult to monitor or enforce such requirements, particularly in foreign jurisdictions and various laws may limit our ability to enforce the terms of these agreements or to terminate the agreements. Any decline in perceived favorable recognition of our brands could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe may face issues with our union-represented employees.\nActive labor contracts covering the terms of employment for the Company's union-represented employees in the U.S. (including those in the U.S. territories) are presently in effect, many of which cover employees at our larger airport locations, primarily with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the International Association of Machinists. These contracts are renegotiated periodically and we anticipate renegotiating labor contracts with approximately 45% of these employees in 2022. Failure to negotiate a new labor agreement when required could result in a work stoppage. Although we believe that our labor relations have generally been good, it is possible that we could become subject to additional work rules imposed by agreements with labor unions, or that contract extensions, work stoppages or other labor disturbances could occur in the future. In addition, our non-union-represented workforce has been subject to unionization efforts in the past, and we could be subject to future unionization, which could lead to increases in our operating costs and/or constraints on our operating flexibility.\nRISKS RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, CYBERSECURITY AND PRIVACY RISKS\nCyber security threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication, and a successful cyber security attack could interrupt or disrupt our information technology systems, or those of our third-party service providers, which could, among other things, disrupt our business, force us to incur costs or cause reputational harm.\nWe encounter continuous exposure to cyber-attacks and other security threats to our information networks and systems and the information stored on those networks and systems. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-services attacks and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the availability, confidentiality and integrity or information. Cyber-attacks could also include phishing attempts or other methods to cause payments or information to be transmitted to an unintended recipient. Cyber\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nthreat actors are also attempting to exploit vulnerabilities through software that is commonly used by companies in cloud-based services, programs and bundled software. Like many other companies, we experience attempts by third-parties to gain access to our systems and networks on a frequent basis, and the frequency of such attempts could increase in the future. At this time, we do not believe that any such attempts have had a material effect on our business, operations or financial condition. We have invested in the protection of data and information technology, and actively work to enhance our business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities to ensure resilience; however, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful.\nWe monitor our obligations under and compliance with global laws requiring information security safeguards and notification in the event of a security breach. We respond to potential security issues by utilizing procedures that provide for controls on detecting and addressing cyber security threats and communicating information to senior personnel and security representatives that we retain. We have also taken steps to address cyber security threats at third-parties that handle, possess, process and store our information to mitigate the potential risk to us. Such measures include contractually requiring the third-parties to maintain certain data security controls. However, because of the rapidly changing nature and sophistication of these security threats, which can be difficult to detect, there can be no assurance that our controls, policies and procedures have or will detect or prevent all of these threats, and we cannot predict the full impact of any past or future incident. Any failure by us to effectively address, enforce and maintain our information technology infrastructure and cyber security requirements may result in substantial harm to our business, including major disruptions to business operations, loss of intellectual property, release of confidential information, malicious corruption of data, regulatory intervention and sanctions or fines, investigation and remediation costs and possible prolonged negative publicity. Additionally, although we maintain insurance coverage to address cyber security events that we believe is adequate for our business, there can be no assurance that such insurance will cover substantially all of our potential costs and expenses related to cyber security incidents that may happen in the future.\nOur business is heavily reliant upon information technology systems, some of which are managed, hosted, provided or used by third parties, including cloud-based service providers, and any significant failures or disruptions to these systems could adversely impact our business.\nOur ability to, among other things, accept reservations, process rental and sales transactions, manage our pricing, manage our revenue earning vehicles, manage our financing arrangements, account for our activities and otherwise conduct our business is dependent on the performance and availability of our networks and systems, as well as those of third-party cloud providers. We have experienced, and from time to time in the future may experience, a failure or interruption that results in the unavailability of certain information systems. Additionally, our major information technology systems, reservations and accounting functions are centralized in a few locations worldwide. Any disruption, termination or substandard provision of services, including by third-party cloud providers, whether as the result of localized conditions (e.g., fire, explosion or hacking), failure of our systems to function as designed, or as the result of events or circumstances of broader geographic impact (e.g., earthquake, storm, flood, epidemic, strike, act of war, civil unrest or terrorist act), could materially adversely affect our business by disrupting normal reservations, customer service, accounting and technology functions; interfering with our ability to manage our vehicles; delaying or disrupting rental and sales processes; adversely affecting our ability to comply with our financing arrangements; and otherwise impacting our ability to manage our business. These events could, individually or in the aggregate, lead to lower revenues, increased costs or other effects on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows, which may be material.\nIf we fail to maintain, upgrade and consolidate our information technology systems, our business could be adversely affected.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we evaluate, upgrade and consolidate our systems, including making changes to legacy systems, replacing legacy systems with successor systems with new functionality and acquiring new systems with new functionality. In addition, we outsource a significant portion of our information technology services. These types of activities subject us to additional costs and inherent risks associated with outsourcing, replacing and changing these systems, including impairment of our ability to manage our business, potential disruption of our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, additional administration and operating\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nexpenses, retention of sufficiently skilled personnel to implement and operate the new systems, demands on management time, potential delays or disruptions from upgrading and consolidating our systems and other risks and costs of delays or difficulties in transitioning to outsourcing alternatives, new systems or integrating new systems into our current systems. If we fail to maintain comprehensive technology enablement and effective processes, we may be unable to support business growth expectations, and such failure could result in excessive overhead costs, high rates of transaction failures and rework, detrimental impact to customers, excessive write-offs and potential litigation, service quality issues, declining employee morale, loss of key talent and other unfavorable consequences. These risks are elevated when legacy systems and infrastructure updates are delayed or otherwise not made on a timely basis, which can result in a heightened security risk. In addition, the implementation of our technology initiatives and systems may cause disruptions in our business operations by severely degrading performance or a complete loss of service and have an adverse effect on our business and operations if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated and our competitive position may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain systems that allow us to manage our business in a competitive manner.\nThe misuse or theft of information we possess, including as a result of cyber security breaches, could harm our brand, reputation or competitive position and give rise to material liabilities which may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe regularly collect, process and store non-public information about millions of individuals and businesses, including both credit and debit card information and other sensitive and confidential personal information in the normal course of our business. In addition, our customers regularly transmit sensitive and confidential information to us via the internet and through other electronic means. Despite the security measures and compliance programs we currently maintain and monitor, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our facilities or systems, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, misrepresentation, or other forms of deception. We and our service providers may not anticipate or prevent all types of attempts to obtain unauthorized access until after they have already been launched, and techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. For example, in recent years, many companies have been subject to high-profile security breaches that involved sophisticated and targeted attacks on the company\u2019s infrastructure and the compromise of non-public sensitive and confidential information. These attacks were often not recognized or detected until after the disclosure of sensitive information notwithstanding the preventive and anticipative measures the companies had maintained. While we work to continuously evaluate our security throughout our business and make appropriate changes to our operating processes and improve our defenses and we implement security measures designed to safeguard our systems and data, and intend to continue implementing additional measures in the future, our implementation efforts may be incomplete or our measures may not be sufficient to maintain the confidentiality, security, or availability of the data we collect, store, and use to operate our business. Additionally, any failure to manage information privacy in compliance with applicable laws, whether as a result of our own error or the error or malfeasance of others, could result in regulatory fines and sanctions, increased litigation, prolonged negative publicity, data breaches, declining customer confidence, loss of key customers, employee liability, shareholder derivative lawsuits and other unfavorable consequences.\nWe may face particular data protection, data security and privacy risks in connection with the European Union's Global Data Protection Regulation and other privacy regulations.\nOur business requires the secure processing and storage of personal information relating to our customers, employees, business partners and others. Strict data privacy laws regulating the collection, transmission, storage and use of employee data and consumers\u2019 personally-identifying information are continuously evolving in the European Union, U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate. In particular, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d) imposes compliance obligations for the collection, use, retention, security, processing, transfer and deletion of personally identifiable information of individuals. In addition, countries such as the United Kingdom have implemented the GDPR through their own legislation, for example, the UK Data Protection Act of 2018. Privacy laws in the U.S. include the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which expands the definition of personal information and grants, among other things, individual rights to access and delete\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\npersonal information, and the right to opt out of the sale of personal information. These laws and regulations can also impose significant forfeitures and penalties for noncompliance and afford private rights of action to individuals under certain circumstances.\nWe actively monitor compliance with data protection and privacy-related laws and other regulations, including upcoming legislation, in the jurisdictions we operate; however, these laws are developing rapidly and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Changes in the legal and regulatory environments in the areas of customer and employee privacy, data security, and cross-border data flows could have a material adverse effect on our business, primarily through the regulation of our marketing and transaction processing activities, the limitation on the types of information that we may collect, process and retain, the resulting costs of complying with such legal and regulatory requirements and potential monetary forfeitures and penalties for noncompliance, which could be significant. Such regulations also may increase our compliance and administrative burden significantly and require us to invest resources and management attention in order to update our information technology systems to meet new requirements.\nRISKS RELATED TO LEGAL, REGULATORY AND TAX MATTERS\nOur foreign operations expose us to risks that may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur foreign operations generate revenue outside the U.S. Accordingly, operating in many different countries exposes us to varying risks, which include: (i) multiple, and sometimes conflicting, foreign regulatory requirements and laws that are subject to change and are often much different than the domestic laws in the U.S., including laws relating to taxes, automobile-related liability, insurance rates, insurance products, consumer privacy, data security, employment matters, cost and fee recovery, and the protection of our trademarks and other intellectual property; (ii) the effect of foreign currency translation risk, as well as limitations on our ability to repatriate income; (iii) varying tax regimes, including consequences from changes in applicable tax laws and our ability to repatriate cash from non-U.S. affiliates without adverse tax consequences; (iv) local ownership or investment requirements, as well as difficulties in obtaining financing in foreign countries for local operations; and (v) political and economic instability, natural calamities, war, and terrorism.\nThe effects of these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nThe recognition of previously-deferred tax gains on the disposition of revenue earning vehicles may not be fully offset by full expensing of newly-purchased revenue earning vehicles.\nA material and extended reduction in vehicle purchases by our U.S. vehicle rental business, for any reason, could require us to make material cash payments for U.S. federal and state income tax liabilities. We cannot offer assurance that allowances for the full expensing of purchased revenue earning vehicles in the future will exceed previously deferred tax gains realized upon the disposition of revenue earning vehicles.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"TCJA\") reduces the allowable expense from 100% of the acquisition costs by 20% per year beginning in 2023, fully eliminating the bonus component by 2027. This change could result in the Company being required to make future material cash tax payments on the sales of revenue earning vehicles. We cannot predict if or when legislation would be enacted in the future to allow full or partial expensing of purchased revenue earning vehicles or to allow deferral of tax gains on the dispositions of revenue earning vehicles.\nUnder Section 163(j) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), certain financing arrangements are not eligible for 100% expensing of the costs of the purchased vehicles. Our ability to fully expense such costs may be impacted as a result of such financing transactions.\nThese events may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) may be limited as a result of our emergence from bankruptcy, a prior ownership change under Section 382 of the Code, and changes under the TCJA.\nIn general, Section 382 of the Code provides an annual limitation with respect to the ability of a corporation to utilize its NOLs and other tax attributes, as well as certain built-in-losses (\"BILs\"), against future taxable income in the event of a change in ownership. Our emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, as well as the sale by entities affiliated with Carl Icahn on May 26, 2020, of approximately 38.9% of our then-outstanding stock, resulted in a change in ownership for purposes of Section 382 of the Code. The Company has performed an analysis of the impact of this ownership change and concluded that there should not be a material impact on U.S. federal NOLs but that there may be some restrictions on the use of NOLs at the state level under state statutes corresponding to Section 382.\nLimitations imposed on our ability to use NOLs, other tax attributes and BILs to offset future taxable income may cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOLs and other tax attributes to expire unused. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. If we experience a subsequent ownership change, it is possible that a significant portion of our tax attributes could be further limited for use to offset future taxable income.\nIn addition, our NOL utilization was statutorily limited under the TCJA, which limited a taxpayer\u2019s ability to use NOLs to 80% of taxable income and disallowed the carryback of NOLs arising after 2017.\nWe face risks related to liabilities and insurance.\nOur businesses expose us to claims for personal injury, death and property damage resulting from the use of the vehicles rented or sold by us, and for employment-related injury claims by our employees. The Company is currently a defendant in numerous actions and has received numerous claims for which actions have not yet been commenced for public liability and property damage arising from the operation of motor vehicles rented from the Company. We generally self-insure up to $10 million per occurrence globally and the Company has $200 million insurance coverage excess of retentions. There can be no assurance that we will not be exposed to uninsured liability at levels in excess of our historical levels, that liabilities in respect of existing or future claims will not exceed the level of our insurance or reserves, that we will have sufficient capital available to pay any uninsured claims or that insurance with unaffiliated carriers will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms or at all. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Insurance and Risk Management\u201d and Note 14, \"Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Commitments,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this 2021 Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \u2018\u2018Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nEnvironmental laws and regulations and the costs of complying with them, or any liability or obligation imposed under them, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations in connection with our operations, including with respect to the ownership and operation of tanks for the storage of petroleum products, such as gasoline, diesel fuel and motor and used oils. We cannot guarantee that the tanks will at all times remain free from leaks or that the use of these tanks will not result in significant spills or leakage. If a leak or a spill occurs, it is possible that the costs to investigate and remediate resulting impacts, as well as any associated fines, could be significant. Historically, we have indemnified various parties for the costs associated with remediating certain hazardous substance storage, recycling or disposal sites and, in some instances, for natural resource damages. Compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations may require material expenditures by us or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows. See Item 1, \u2018\u2018Business-Government Regulation and Environmental Matters\u2019\u2019 in this 2021 Annual Report.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nThe U.S. Congress and other legislative and regulatory authorities in the U.S. and internationally have considered, and will likely continue to consider, numerous measures related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. Should rules establishing limitations on greenhouse gas emissions or rules imposing fees on entities deemed to be responsible for greenhouse gas emissions become effective, demand for our services could be affected, our vehicle, and/or other, costs could increase, and our business could be adversely affected.\nChanges in the U.S. legal and regulatory environment that affect our operations, including laws and regulations relating to accounting principles, taxes, automobile related liability, insurance rates, insurance products, consumer privacy, data security, employment matters, licensing and franchising, used-car sales (including retail sales), cost and fee recovery and the banking and financing industry could disrupt our business, increase our expenses or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of U.S. laws and regulations and changes in the level of government regulation of our business have the potential to materially alter our business practices and materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. Those changes may occur through new laws and regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws and regulations.\nIn addition, the current domestic and international political environment, including government shutdowns and changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs, has resulted in uncertainty surrounding the future state of the global economy. The U.S. federal government may propose additional changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes, and other government rules and regulations. These regulatory changes could significantly impact our business and financial performance.\nAny new, or change in existing, U.S. law and regulation with respect to optional insurance products or policies could increase our costs of compliance or make it uneconomical to offer such products, which would lead to a reduction in revenue and profitability. For further discussion regarding how changes in the regulation of insurance intermediaries may affect us, see Item 1, \u2018\u2018Business-Insurance and Risk Management\u2019\u2019 in this 2021 Annual Report. If customers decline to purchase supplemental liability insurance products from us as a result of any changes in these laws or otherwise, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe derive revenue through rental activities of our brands under franchise and license arrangements. These arrangements are subject to various international, federal and state laws and regulations that impose limitations on our interactions with counterparties. In addition, the used-vehicle sale industry, including our network of company-operated retail vehicle sales locations, is subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, such as those relating to motor vehicle sales, retail installment sales and related finance and insurance matters, advertising, licensing, consumer protection and consumer privacy. Changes in these laws and regulations that impact our franchising and licensing agreements or our used-vehicle sales could adversely affect our results.\nIn most jurisdictions where we operate, we pass-through various expenses, including the recovery of vehicle licensing costs and airport concession fees, to our rental customers as separate charges. We believe that our expense pass-throughs, where imposed, are properly disclosed and are lawful. However, in the event of incorrect calculations or disclosures with respect to expense pass-throughs, or a successful challenge to the methodology we have used for determining our expense pass-through treatment, we could be subject to fines or other liabilities. In addition, we may in the future be subject to potential legislative, regulatory or administrative changes or actions which could limit, restrict or prohibit our ability to separately state, charge and recover vehicle licensing costs and airport concession fees, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nCertain proposed or enacted laws and regulations with respect to the banking and finance industries, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (including risk retention requirements) and amendments to the SEC's rules relating to asset-backed securities, could restrict our access to certain financing\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\narrangements and increase our financing costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe are subject to many different forms of taxation in various jurisdictions throughout the world, which could lead to disagreements with tax authorities regarding the application of tax laws.\nWe are subject to many forms of taxation in the jurisdictions throughout the world in which we operate, including, but not limited to, income tax, withholding tax and payroll-related taxes. Tax law and administration are extremely complex and often require us, together with our advisors, to make subjective determinations.\nFor example, in accordance with Section 482 of the Code and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development guidelines, we have established transfer pricing policies to govern our intercompany operations. Implementing transfer pricing policies can be extremely complex and may often require us, together with our advisors, to make subjective determinations.\nTax authorities could disagree with our determinations, which disagreements could result in lengthy legal disputes and, ultimately, the payment of substantial funds to government authorities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nAn impairment of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets could have a material impact to our results of operations.\nOn an annual basis as of October 1, and at interim periods when circumstances require as a result of a triggering event, we test the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets by performing an impairment analysis. An impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value as determined using level 3 inputs under the GAAP fair value hierarchy. The reviews of fair value involve judgment and estimates, including estimated future cash flows and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") margins, projected revenues, royalty rates and discount rates. A significant decline in either projected revenues, projected cash flows or the weighted average cost of capital used to determine fair value could result in a material impairment charge. For details of the impairment charges incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020, see Note 5, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,\" to the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this 2021 Annual Report under the caption Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\nOur global business requires a compliance program to promote organizational adherence to applicable laws and regulations.\nWe have a compliance program designed to (i) identify applicable anti-bribery requirements (e.g., laws limiting commercial bribery and corruption), (ii) identify applicable anti-trust requirements (e.g., laws to prevent price fixing, contract rigging, market or customer allocations, etc.), (iii) interpret the application of such requirements, (iv) educate target audiences and (v) provide independent, ongoing compliance monitoring.\nOur operations in many different countries increases the risk of a violation, or alleged violation, of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, other applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations, the economic sanction programs administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the anti-boycott regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Office of Anti-Boycott Compliance. The failure of our program to operate as designed can result in a failure to comply with applicable laws, which could result in significant penalties or otherwise harm the Company\u2019s reputation and business. There can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents will comply with the Company\u2019s policies that mandate compliance with these laws. Violations of these laws could result in legal and regulatory sanctions, increased litigation and fines, prolonged negative publicity, diminished investor confidence, declining employee morale and other unfavorable consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nHertz Holdings is a holding company with no operations of its own and depends on its subsidiaries for cash.\nThe operations of Hertz Holdings are conducted nearly entirely through its subsidiaries and its ability to generate cash to meet its debt service obligations or to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries via dividends or intercompany loans. However, none of the subsidiaries of Hertz Holdings are obligated to make funds available to Hertz Holdings for the payment of dividends or the service of its debt. In addition, certain states' laws and the terms of certain of our debt agreements significantly restrict, or prohibit, the ability of Hertz and its subsidiaries to pay dividends, make loans or otherwise transfer assets to Hertz Holdings, including state laws that require dividends to be paid only from surplus. If Hertz Holdings does not receive cash from its subsidiaries, then Hertz Holdings' financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS\nOur indebtedness exposes us to various risks, which could impair our financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had a total indebtedness of approximately $10.9 billion, including $7.9 billion of vehicle related debt and $3.0 billion of non-vehicle debt. A portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates which exposes us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations and higher interest expenses in the event of increases in interest rates. See Item 7A, \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d in this 2021 Annual Report for additional information related to interest rate risk.\nOur ability to satisfy and manage our debt obligations depends on our ability to generate cash flow and on overall financial market conditions. To some extent, this is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, which makes us more vulnerable to adverse changes in these factors. As a result, our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to permit us to pay principal, premium, if any, or interest on our debt obligations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations and meet our other cash needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell or curtail assets or operations, seek additional capital, or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. If we must sell or curtail our assets or operations, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we would be able to borrow additional amounts or refinance our current indebtedness to fund working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or acquisitions and other purposes on favorable terms.\nOur reliance on asset-backed and asset-based financing arrangements to purchase vehicles subjects us to a number of risks, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe rely significantly on asset-backed and asset-based financing to purchase vehicles. If we are unable to refinance or replace our existing asset-backed and asset-based financing or continue to finance new vehicle acquisitions through asset-backed or asset-based financing on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, then our costs of financing could increase significantly and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, interest costs, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur asset-backed and asset-based financing capacity could be decreased, our financing costs and interest rates could be increased, or our future access to the financial markets could be limited, as a result of risks and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, including: (i) the acceptance by credit markets of the structures and structural risks associated with our asset-backed and asset-based financing arrangements; (ii) the credit ratings provided by credit rating agencies for our asset-backed indebtedness; (iii) third parties requiring changes in the terms and structure of our asset-backed or asset-based financing arrangements, including increased credit enhancement or required cash collateral and/or other liquid reserves; (iv) the insolvency or deterioration of the financial condition of one or more of our principal vehicle manufacturers; or (v) changes in laws or regulations, including judicial review of issues of first impression, that negatively affect any of our asset-backed or asset-based financing arrangements. Although we continued to maintain access to asset-backed financing during the Chapter 11 Cases, the cost of such facilities was in excess of costs incurred by our competitors. Following our emergence from\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nbankruptcy, the cost of asset-backed financing has returned to competitive levels, however, there can be no assurance that this competitive disadvantage will not reoccur in the future.\nOur asset-backed and certain asset-based vehicle financing facilities include credit enhancement provisions that require us to provide cash or additional vehicle collateral in the event the estimated market values for the vehicles used as collateral decrease below net book values. As a result, reductions in the estimated market value of vehicles used as collateral could adversely affect our profitability and potentially lead to decreased borrowing base availability. In addition, if our ability to sell vehicles in the used vehicle marketplace were to become severely limited we may have difficulty meeting the minimum required collateral levels, and the principal under our asset-backed and certain asset-based financing arrangements may be required to be repaid sooner than anticipated with vehicle disposition proceeds and lease payments we make to our special purpose financing subsidiaries. If that were to occur, the holders of our asset-backed and certain asset-based debt may have the ability to exercise their right to direct the trustee or other secured party to foreclose on and sell vehicles to generate proceeds sufficient to repay such debt.\nIn certain circumstances, the proceeds of sales of vehicles that collateralize asset-backed financing arrangements could be required to be applied to the payment of principal and interest on the affected facility or series. Additionally, certain events could result in a liquidation event pursuant to which the trustee or holders of the affected asset-backed financing arrangement would be permitted to require the sale of the assets collateralizing that series. Failure by us to have proper financing and debt management processes may result in cash shortfalls and liquidity problems, emergency financing at high interest rates, violations of debt covenants, an inability to execute strategic initiatives, which may affect our liquidity and our ability to maintain sufficient levels of revenue earning vehicles to meet customer demands and could trigger cross-defaults under certain of our other financing arrangements.\nSubstantially all of our consolidated assets secure certain of our outstanding indebtedness, which could materially adversely affect our debt and equity holders and our business.\nSubstantially all of our consolidated assets, including our revenue earning vehicles, are subject to security interests or are otherwise encumbered for the lenders under our senior credit facilities, asset-backed and asset-based financing arrangements.\nBecause substantially all of our assets are encumbered under financing arrangements, our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial flexibility and force us to attempt to incur additional unsecured indebtedness, which may not be available to us.\nWe may not be able to deduct certain business interest expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe limitations on the deductibility of business interest expense under Section 163(j) of the Code, which was significantly modified by the TCJA and then temporarily modified by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d), could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity. Further limitations on the deductibility of interest on indebtedness may also result from an adverse determination that debt instruments should be treated as equity for tax purposes.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OWNERSHIP OF COMMON STOCK\nWe cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. Stock repurchases could also increase the volatility of our stock and could diminish our liquidity.\nOur Board has authorized a stock repurchase program that does not have an expiration date. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our common stock. We cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC.

Further, stock repurchases could affect the market price of our common stock or increase its volatility and decrease our cash balances and/or our liquidity.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile.\nNumerous factors, including many over which we have no control, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. These risks include those described or referred to in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and in the other documents incorporated herein by reference as well as, among other things:\n\u2022our operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell;\n\u2022our ability to repay our debt;\n\u2022our access to financial and capital markets to refinance our debt or replace the existing credit facilities;\n\u2022investor perceptions of us and the industry and markets in which we operate;\n\u2022our dividend policy;\n\u2022future sales of equity or equity-related securities;\n\u2022announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us;\n\u2022issuances of new or updated research reports by security or industry analysts, or those analysts not publishing or ceasing to publish reports about us, our industry or out market;\n\u2022changes in, or results that vary from, earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts; and\n\u2022general financial, domestic, economic and other market conditions.\nIn addition, stock markets experience significant price and volume fluctuations from time to time that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may have material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management, including, generally, provisions that:\n\u2022do not provide cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022provide for a classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of the Board;\n\u2022allow for removal of directors only for cause;\n\u2022allow only the Board to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board or the resignation, death, retirement, disqualification or removal of a director;\n\u2022require advance notice for stockholder proposals to be brought before a meeting of stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to the board of directors;\n\u2022only allow stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting;\n\u2022limit the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting; and\n\u2022authorize blank check preferred stock.\nThese provisions may make it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we have elected not to be governed by Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \"DGCL\"), which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with a stockholder owning\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\n15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, unless the stockholder has held the stock for a period of at least three years.\nThe choice of forum provision in our Certificate of Incorporation could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or colleagues.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the \u201cCourt of Chancery\u201d) is the sole and exclusive forum for any stockholder to bring any state law claim for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of a breach of fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee, or agent of the Company to us or to our stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the DGCL, our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, (4) any action or proceeding as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery, and (5) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. In addition, the choice of forum provision provides that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, claims brought under the Securities Act must be brought exclusively in the federal district courts of the United States. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other colleagues, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other colleagues. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our Certificate of Incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nWe may pursue strategic transactions, including acquisitions and divestitures, which could be difficult to implement, disrupt our business or change our business profile significantly.\nAny future strategic acquisition or disposition of assets or a business could involve numerous risks, including: (i) potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; (ii) difficulty integrating the acquired business or segregating assets and operations to be disposed of; (iii) exposure to unknown, contingent or other liabilities, including litigation arising in connection with the acquisition or disposition or against any business we may acquire; (iv) changing our business profile in ways that could have unintended negative consequences; and (v) the failure to achieve anticipated synergies. If we enter into significant strategic transactions, the related accounting charges may affect our financial condition and results of operations, particularly in the case of an acquisition. The financing of any significant acquisition may result in changes in our capital structure, including the incurrence of additional indebtedness. A material disposition could require the amendment or refinancing of our outstanding indebtedness or a portion thereof.\nOur results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.\nThe accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, incur incremental compliance costs, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, and our results of operations, our stock price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected.\nHERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTHE HERTZ CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nA business continuity plan is necessary for our global business.\nWe have a business continuity plan designed to (i) identify key assets, operations and underlying threats, (ii) define and assess relevant threats (e.g., natural disasters, pandemics, terrorism, etc.) on business operations, (iii) develop and categorize action plans to minimize the impact of the identified threats and (iv) test the adequacy of our action plans. If our business continuity plan fails to operate as intended, we may experience significant business disruptions, release of confidential information, malicious corruption of data, regulatory intervention and sanctions, prolonged negative publicity, litigation and liabilities, product and service quality failures, irreparable harm to customer relationships and other unfavorable consequences which may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe participate in multiemployer pension plans and could face a significant liability if we withdraw from participation in such plans or in the event other employers in such plans withdraw or are unable to, or fail to, pay their liabilities.\nIn the event that we withdraw from participation in one of the multiemployer plans in which we participate, then applicable law could require us to make an additional lump-sum contribution to the plan, and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our consolidated statements of operations and as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. Our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan\u2019s funding of vested benefits. If our multiemployer plans have underfunded liabilities, such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent, withdraw from the applicable plan or are unable or fail to pay their withdrawal liability.
