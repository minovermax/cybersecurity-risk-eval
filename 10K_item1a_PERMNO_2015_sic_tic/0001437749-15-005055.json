These risks include, but are not limited to, the principal factors listed below and the other matters set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All of these risks should be carefully considered.\nEconomic and business conditions that are beyond our control, including cyclicality and seasonality, and concerns over the sustainability of the economic recovery, have in the past had a significant adverse impact on our operating results, and could negatively impact our operating results in the future.\nThe three major markets in which we sell our products, RV, MH and industrial, have been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand, and are dependent upon various factors, including the general level of economic activity, consumer confidence, interest rates, access to financing, inventory and production levels, and the cost and availability of fuel. Economic and demographic factors can cause substantial fluctuations in production, which in turn impact sales and operating results. Consequently, the results for any prior period may not be indicative of results for any future period.\nManufacturing operations in the RV and MH industries historically have been seasonal and are generally at the highest levels when the climate is moderate. However, seasonal industry trends in the past several years have been different from prior years, primarily reflecting volatile economic conditions, fluctuations in RV dealer inventories, changing dealer show schedules, interest rates, access to financing, the cost of fuel, and increased demand from RV dealers. Consequently, future seasonal trends may be different from prior years.\nIn addition, a macroeconomic downturn has historically adversely affected our operating results and could again in the future. Companies in these markets are subject to volatility in production levels, shipments, sales and operating results due to changes in external factors such as general economic conditions, including credit availability, consumer confidence, employment rates, interest rates, inflation and other economic conditions affecting consumer demand, as well as demographic and political changes. We cannot predict the duration of an economic downturn, the timing or strength of a subsequent economic recovery or the extent to which an economic downturn will continue to negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur significant charges or be adversely impacted by the consolidation and/or closure of all or part of a manufacturing or distribution facility.\nWe periodically assess the cost structure of our operating facilities to distribute and/or manufacture and sell our products in the most efficient manner. Based on our assessments and if required by business conditions, we may make capital investments to move, discontinue manufacturing and/or distribution capabilities, or products and product lines, sell or close all or part of additional manufacturing and/or distribution facilities in the future. These changes could result in significant future charges or disruptions in our operations, and we may not achieve the expected benefits from these changes, which could result in an adverse impact on our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition.\nThe financial condition of our customers and suppliers may deteriorate as a result of weakening conditions in the economy and competitive conditions in their markets.\nThe markets we serve historically have been highly sensitive to changes in the economic environment. Weakening conditions in the economy could cause the financial condition of our customers and suppliers to deteriorate, which could negatively affect our business through the loss of sales or the inability to meet our commitments. Many of our customers participate in highly competitive markets and their financial condition may deteriorate as a result. A decline in the financial condition of our customers could hinder our ability to collect amounts owed by customers. In addition, such a decline could result in lower demand for our products and services.\nAlthough we have a large number of customers, our sales are significantly concentrated with two customers, the loss of which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nTwo customers in the RV market accounted for a combined 58% of our consolidated net sales in 2014. The loss of either of these customers could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, we do not have long-term agreements with our customers and cannot predict that we will maintain our current relationships with these customers or that we will continue to supply them at current levels.\nA significant percentage of the Company\u2019s sales are concentrated in the RV industry, and declines in the level of RV unit shipments or reductions in industry growth, could adversely impact our sales levels to this industry and our operating results.\nIn 2014, 74% of our net sales were to the RV industry versus 72% in 2013 and 69% in 2012. The increase in the Company\u2019s sales concentration in the RV industry primarily resulted from an increase in RV wholesale unit shipment levels over the last several years, increased RV market penetration by the Company, and the Company\u2019s completion of several RV-related acquisitions in the 2010 to 2014 period. Future declines in RV unit shipment levels or reductions in industry growth could significantly reduce the Company\u2019s revenue from the RV industry and have a material adverse impact on our operating results in 2015 and other future periods.\nThe manufactured housing and recreational vehicle industries are highly competitive and some of our competitors may have greater resources than we do.\nWe operate in a highly competitive business environment and our sales could be negatively impacted by our inability to maintain or increase prices, changes in geographic or product mix, or the decision of our customers to purchase our competitors\u2019 products instead of our products or to produce in-house products that we currently produce. We compete not only with other suppliers to the RV and MH producers but also with suppliers to traditional site-built homebuilders and suppliers of cabinetry. Sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, advertising, operational, promotional, or other decisions made by purchasers of our products. Additionally, we cannot control the decisions made by suppliers of our distributed and manufactured products and therefore, our ability to maintain our exclusive and non-exclusive distributor contracts and agreements may be adversely impacted.\nThe greater financial resources or the lower amount of debt of certain of our competitors may enable them to commit larger amounts of capital in response to changing market conditions. Certain competitors may also have the ability to develop innovative new products that could put the Company at a competitive disadvantage. If we are unable to compete successfully against other manufacturers and suppliers to the RV and MH industries, we could lose customers and sales could decline, or we may not be able to improve or maintain profit margins on sales to customers or be able to continue to compete successfully in our core markets.\nThe cyclical nature of the domestic housing market has caused our sales and operating results to fluctuate. These fluctuations may continue in the future, which could result in operating losses during downturns.\nThe U.S. housing industry is cyclical and is influenced by many national and regional economic and demographic factors, including:\n\u25cf\nterms and availability of financing for homebuyers and retailers;\n\u25cf\noverall consumer confidence and the level of discretionary consumer spending;\n\u25cf\ninterest rates;\n\u25cf\npopulation and employment trends;\n\u25cf\nincome levels;\n\u25cf\nhousing demand; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions, including inflation, deflation and recessions.\nThe RV and MH industries and the industrial markets can be affected by fluctuations in the residential housing market. As a result of the foregoing factors, our sales and operating results can fluctuate, and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future. Moreover, cyclical and seasonal downturns in the residential housing market may cause us to experience operating losses.\nFuel shortages or high prices for fuel have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our operations.\nThe products produced by the RV industry typically require gasoline or diesel fuel for their operation, or the use of a vehicle requiring gasoline or diesel fuel for their operation. There can be no assurance that the supply of gasoline and diesel fuel will continue uninterrupted or that the price or tax on fuel will not significantly increase in the future. Shortages of gasoline and diesel fuel have had a significant adverse effect on the demand for recreational vehicles in the past and would be expected to have an adverse effect on demand in the future. Rapid significant increases in fuel prices, as we experienced in recent years, appear to affect the demand for recreational vehicles when gasoline prices reach unusually high levels. Such a reduction in overall demand for recreational vehicles could have a materially adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.\nWe are dependent on third-party suppliers and manufacturers.\nGenerally, our raw materials, supplies and energy requirements are obtained from various sources and in the quantities desired. While alternative sources are available, our business is subject to the risk of price increases and periodic delays in delivery. Fluctuations in the prices of these requirements may be driven by the supply/demand relationship for that commodity, governmental regulation, economic conditions in other countries, religious holidays, natural disasters, and other events. In addition, if any of our suppliers seek bankruptcy relief or otherwise cannot continue their business as anticipated, the availability or price of these requirements could be adversely affected.\nIncreases in demand for our products could make it more difficult for us to obtain additional skilled labor, and available capacity may initially not be utilized efficiently.\nIn certain geographic regions in which we have manufacturing facilities, we have experienced, and could again experience, shortages of qualified employees. If demand continues to increase, we may not be able to increase production to timely satisfy demand, and may initially incur higher labor and production costs, which could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results.\nThe increased cost and limited availability of certain raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nPrices of certain materials, including gypsum, lauan, particleboard, MDF, aluminum and other commodity products, can be volatile and change dramatically with changes in supply and demand. Certain products are purchased from overseas and their availability is dependent upon climate changes, seasonal and religious holidays, political unrest, economic conditions overseas, natural disasters, vessel shipping schedules and port availability. Further, certain of our commodity product suppliers sometimes operate at or near capacity, resulting in some products having the potential of being put on allocation. We generally have been able to maintain adequate supplies of materials and to pass higher material costs on to our customers in the form of surcharges and base price increases where needed. However, it is not certain future price increases can be passed on to our customers without affecting demand or that limited availability of materials will not impact our production capabilities. Our sales levels and operating results could be negatively impacted by changes in any of these items.\nWe are subject to governmental and environmental regulations, and failure in our compliance efforts or events beyond our control could result in damages, expenses or liabilities that individually or in the aggregate would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Accordingly, we are subject to various governmental and environmental regulations regarding these substances. In addition, the implementation of new regulations or amendments to existing regulations could significantly increase the cost of the Company\u2019s products. We currently use materials that we believe comply with government regulations. We cannot presently determine what, if any, legislation may be adopted by Congress or state or local governing bodies, or the effect any such legislation may have on our customers or us. In addition, failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines or potential civil or criminal liability. Both scenarios could negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition.\nCompliance with conflict minerals disclosure requirements will create additional compliance cost and may create reputational challenges.\nThe SEC adopted rules pursuant to Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act setting forth new disclosure requirements concerning the use or potential use of certain minerals, deemed conflict minerals (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), that are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These requirements necessitate due diligence efforts on our part to assess whether such minerals are used in our products in order to make the relevant required annual disclosures. There will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply because of such verification activities. The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict-free minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. We may also face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.\nThe inability to attract and retain qualified executive officers and key personnel may adversely affect our operations.\nWhile we include succession planning as part of our ongoing talent development and management process to help ensure the continuity of our business model, the loss of any of our executive officers or other key personnel could reduce our ability to manage our business and strategic plan in the short-term and could cause our sales and operating results to decline. In addition, our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain executive management, key employees, and other qualified personnel.\nOur ability to integrate acquired businesses may adversely affect operations.\nAs part of our business and strategic plan, we look for strategic acquisitions to provide shareholder value. Any acquisition will require the effective integration of an existing business and its administrative, financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, and other functions to maximize synergies. Acquired businesses involve a number of risks that may affect our financial performance, including increased leverage, diversion of management resources, assumption of liabilities of the acquired businesses, and possible corporate culture conflicts. If we are unable to successfully integrate these acquisitions, we may not realize the benefits identified in our due diligence process, and our financial results may be negatively impacted. Additionally, significant unexpected liabilities could arise from these acquisitions.\nIncreased levels of indebtedness may harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $101.1 million of total debt outstanding under our $165 million revolving credit facility (the \u201c2012 Credit Facility\u201d) that was established pursuant to our current credit agreement, as amended (the \u201c2012 Credit Agreement\u201d).\nIn certain circumstances, an increase in our level of indebtedness could have adverse consequences on our future operations, including making it more difficult for us to meet our payments on outstanding debt and we may not be able to find alternative financing sources to replace our indebtedness in such an event. Furthermore, such increases could (i) reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; (ii) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; (iii) place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged; and (iv) create concerns about our credit quality which could result in the loss of supplier contracts and/or customers.\nOur 2012 Credit Agreement contains various financial performance and other covenants. If we do not remain in compliance with these covenants, our 2012 Credit Agreement could be terminated and the amounts outstanding thereunder could become immediately due and payable.\nWe have debt outstanding that contains financial and non-financial covenants with which we must comply that place restrictions on us. There can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance with the financial covenants under our 2012 Credit Agreement. These covenants require that we comply with a maximum level of a consolidated total leverage ratio and a minimum level of a consolidated interest coverage ratio under the 2012 Credit Agreement, and adhere to annual capital expenditure limitations as defined by our 2012 Credit Agreement. If we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our 2012 Credit Agreement, the lenders could cause our debt to become due and payable prior to maturity or it could result in our having to refinance the indebtedness under unfavorable terms. If our debt were accelerated, our assets might not be sufficient to repay our debt in full and there can be no assurance that we would be able to refinance any or all of this indebtedness.\nDue to industry conditions and our operating results, we have had limited access to sources of capital in the past. If we are unable to locate suitable sources of capital when needed, we may be unable to maintain or expand our business.\nWe depend on our cash balances, our cash flows from operations, and our 2012 Credit Facility to finance our operating requirements, capital expenditures and other needs. If the general recessionary economic conditions that impacted the economy in 2007-2010 should return in the future, production of RVs and manufactured homes could decline, resulting in reduced demand for our products. A decline in our operating results could negatively impact our liquidity. If our cash balances, cash flows from operations, and availability under our 2012 Credit Facility are insufficient to finance our operations and alternative capital is not available, we may not be able to expand our business and make acquisitions, or we may need to curtail or limit our existing operations.\nWe have letters of credit representing collateral for our casualty insurance programs and for general operating purposes that have been issued under our 2012 Credit Agreement. The inability to retain our current letters of credit, to obtain alternative letter of credit sources, or to retain our 2012 Credit Agreement to support these programs could require us to post cash collateral, reduce the amount of cash available for our operations, or cause us to curtail or limit existing operations.\nIncreased levels of inventory may adversely affect our profitability.\nOur customers generally do not maintain long-term supply contracts and, therefore, we must bear the risk of advanced estimation of customer orders. We maintain an inventory to support these customers\u2019 needs. Changes in demand, market conditions and/or product specifications could result in material obsolescence and a lack of alternative markets for certain of our customer specific products and could negatively impact operating results.\nWe could incur charges for impairment of assets, including goodwill and other long-lived assets, due to potential declines in the fair value of those assets or a decline in expected profitability of the Company or individual reporting units of the Company.\nA portion of our total assets as of December 31, 2014 was comprised of goodwill, amortizable intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment. Under generally accepted accounting principles, each of these assets is subject to periodic review and testing to determine whether the asset is recoverable or realizable. The events or changes that could require us to test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment include changes in our estimated future cash flows, changes in rates of growth in our industry or in any of our reporting units, and decreases in our stock price and market capitalization.\nIn the future, if sales demand or market conditions change from those projected by management, asset write-downs may be required. Significant impairment charges, although not always affecting current cash flow, could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position.\nA variety of factors could influence fluctuations in the market price for our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future in response to a number of factors, including those discussed below. The market price of our common stock has in the past fluctuated and is likely to continue to fluctuate. Some of the factors that may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u25cf\nvariations in our and our competitors\u2019 operating results;\n\u25cf\nhistorically low trading volume;\n\u25cf\nhigh concentration of shares held by institutional investors and in particular our largest shareholder, Tontine Capital (as defined herein);\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf\nthe gain or loss of significant customers;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nevents affecting other companies that the market deems comparable to us;\n\u25cf\ngeneral conditions in industries in which we operate;\n\u25cf\ngeneral conditions in the United States and abroad;\n\u25cf\nthe presence or absence of short selling of our common stock;\n\u25cf\nfuture sales of our common stock or debt securities;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of technological improvements or new products; and\n\u25cf\nthe sale by Tontine Capital or its announcement of an intention to sell, all or a portion of its equity interests in the Company.\nA significant portion of our common stock is held by Tontine Capital Partners, L.P. and affiliates (collectively, \u201cTontine Capital\u201d), which has the ability to influence our affairs significantly, including all matters requiring shareholder approval, and whose interests may not be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders. In addition, the ownership of a major portion of our common stock is concentrated in the hands of a few holders.\nBased on information contained in a filing by Tontine Capital with the SEC on February 27, 2015, the aggregate number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock beneficially owned by Tontine Capital was 1,877,680 or 18.3 % of our outstanding common stock.\nTontine Capital has the ability to influence our affairs significantly, including all matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of our directors, the adoption of amendments to our Articles of Incorporation, the approval of mergers and sales of all or substantially all of our assets, decisions affecting our capital structure and other significant corporate transactions. In addition to its current major interest, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement with Tontine Capital, dated April 10, 2007, if Tontine Capital (i) holds between 7.5% and 14.9% of our common stock then outstanding, Tontine Capital has the right to appoint one nominee to our board; or (ii) holds at least 15% of our common stock then outstanding, Tontine Capital has the right to appoint two nominees to our board. As of February 27, 2015, Tontine Capital has one director on the Company\u2019s board of directors and has not exercised its right to nominate a second director to the board.\nThe interests of Tontine Capital may not in all cases be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders. The influence of Tontine Capital may also have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. In addition, Tontine Capital and its affiliates are in the business of investing in companies and may, from time to time, invest in companies that compete directly or indirectly with us. Tontine Capital and its affiliates may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nThe ownership of a major portion of our common stock is concentrated in the hands of Tontine Capital and a few other holders. We are not able to predict whether or when Tontine Capital or other large stockholders will sell or otherwise dispose of additional shares of our common stock. Sales or other dispositions of our common stock by these stockholders could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nIn filings with the SEC, Tontine Capital has indicated that it may dispose of its equity interests in the Company at any time and from time to time. This public disclosure and any future dispositions of stock by Tontine Capital could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn filings with the SEC, Tontine Capital has indicated that it may dispose of its equity interests in the Company at any time and from time to time in the open market, through dispositions in kind to parties holding an ownership interest in Tontine Capital or otherwise. The public disclosure of such possible disposition may adversely affect the market price for our common stock due to the large number of shares involved. In addition, we are not able to predict whether or when Tontine Capital will dispose of its stock. Any such future disposition of stock by Tontine Capital may also adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are required to evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and could have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. Such report contains, among other matters, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year, including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management. Each year we must prepare or update the process documentation and perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. During this process, if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that such internal control is effective. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. We and our independent auditors may in the future discover areas of our internal controls that need further attention and improvement, particularly with respect to any businesses that we decide to acquire in the future. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Investor perception that our internal controls are inadequate or that we are unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely, consistent basis may adversely affect our stock price. Failure to comply with Section 404 could also potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, NASDAQ, or other regulatory authorities.\nCertain provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws may delay, defer or prevent a change in control that our shareholders each might consider to be in their best interest.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making them unacceptably expensive to the raider, and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover.\nWe have in place a Rights Agreement, which permits under certain circumstances each holder of common stock, other than potential acquirers, to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of a newly created series of our preferred stock at a purchase price of $30 or to acquire additional shares of our common stock at 50% of the current market price. The rights are not exercisable or transferable until a person or group acquires 20% or more of our outstanding common stock, except with respect to Tontine Capital and its affiliates and associates, which are exempt from the provisions of the Rights Agreement pursuant to an amendment signed on March 12, 2008. The effects of the Rights Agreement would be to discourage a stockholder from attempting to take over our company without negotiating with our Board of Directors.\nConditions within the insurance markets could impact our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions for various liability coverage and could potentially result in uninsured losses.\nWe generally negotiate our insurance contracts annually for property, casualty, workers compensation, general liability, health insurance, and directors and officers liability coverage. Due to conditions within these insurance markets and other factors beyond our control, future coverage limits, terms and conditions and the amount of the related premiums could have a negative impact on our operating results. While we continually measure the risk/reward of policy limits and coverage, the lack of coverage in certain circumstances could result in potential uninsured losses.", "PERMNO": 61496, "SIC": 2430, "TIC": "PATK"}
