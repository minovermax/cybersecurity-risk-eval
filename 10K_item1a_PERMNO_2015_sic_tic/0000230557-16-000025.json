{"cik": "230557", "company": "SELECTIVE INSURANCE GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAny of the following risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results. They could have a significant impact on our business, liquidity, capital resources, results of operations, financial condition, and debt ratings. These risk factors might affect, alter, or change actions that we might take in executing our long-term capital strategy, including but not limited to, contributing capital to any or all of the Insurance Subsidiaries, issuing additional debt and/or equity securities, repurchasing our equity securities, redeeming our fixed income securities, or increasing or decreasing stockholders\u2019 dividends. The following list of risk factors is not exhaustive, and others may exist.\nRisks Related to Insurance Segments\nOur loss and loss expense reserves may not be adequate to cover actual losses and expenses.\nWe are required to maintain loss and loss expense reserves for our estimated liability for losses and loss expenses associated with reported and unreported insurance claims. Our estimates of reserve amounts are based on facts and circumstances that we know, including our expectations of the ultimate settlement and claim administration expenses, including inflationary trends particularly regarding medical costs, predictions of future events, trends in claims severity and frequency, and other subjective factors relating to our insurance policies in force. There is no method for precisely estimating the ultimate liability for settlement of claims. We cannot be certain that the reserves we establish are adequate or will be adequate in the future. From time-to-time, we increase reserves if they are inadequate or reduce them if they are redundant. An increase in reserves: (i) reduces net income and stockholders\u2019 equity for the period in which the reserves are increased; and (ii) could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nWe are subject to losses from catastrophic events.\nOur results are subject to losses from natural and man-made catastrophes, including, but not limited to: hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, terrorism, explosions, severe winter weather, floods, and fires, some of which may be related to climate changes. The frequency and severity of these catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. One year may be relatively free of such events while another may have multiple events. For further discussion regarding man-made catastrophes that relate to terrorism, see the risk factor directly below regarding the potential for significant losses from acts of terrorism.\nThere is widespread interest among scientists, legislators, regulators, and the public regarding the effect that greenhouse gas emissions may have on our environment, including climate change. If greenhouse gases continue to impact our climate, it is possible that more devastating catastrophic events could occur.\nThe magnitude of catastrophe losses is determined by the severity of the event and the total amount of insured exposures in the area affected by the event as determined by ISO's Property Claim Services unit. Most of the risks underwritten by our insurance segments are concentrated geographically in the Eastern and Midwestern regions of the United States, particularly in New Jersey, which represented approximately 21% of our total NPW during 2015. Catastrophes in the Eastern and Midwestern regions of the United States could adversely impact our financial results, as was the case in 2010, 2011, and 2012.\nAlthough catastrophes can cause losses in a variety of property and casualty insurance lines, most of our historical catastrophe-related claims have been from commercial property and homeowners coverages. In an effort to limit our exposure to catastrophe losses, we purchase catastrophe reinsurance. Catastrophe reinsurance could prove inadequate if: (i) the various modeling software programs that we use to analyze the Insurance Subsidiaries\u2019 risk result in an inadequate purchase of reinsurance by us; (ii) a major catastrophe loss exceeds the reinsurance limit or the reinsurers\u2019 financial capacity; or (iii) the frequency of catastrophe losses results in our Insurance Subsidiaries exceeding the aggregate limits provided by the catastrophe reinsurance treaty. Even after considering our reinsurance protection, our exposure to catastrophe risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nWe are subject to potential significant losses from acts of terrorism.\nAs a Standard Commercial Lines and E&S Lines writer, we are required to participate in TRIPRA, which was extended by Congress to December 31, 2020. TRIPRA requires private insurers and the United States government to share the risk of loss on future acts of terrorism certified by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. Under TRIPRA, insureds with non-workers compensation commercial policies have the option to accept or decline our terrorism coverage or negotiate with us for other terms. In 2015, 87% of our Standard Commercial Lines non-workers compensation policyholders purchased terrorism coverage that included nuclear, biological, chemical, and radioactive (\"NBCR\") events. Terrorism coverage is mandatory for all primary workers compensation policies, so the TRIPRA back-stop applies to these policies. A risk exists that, if the U.S. Secretary of Treasury does not certify certain future terrorist events, we would be required to pay related covered losses without TRIPRA's risk sharing benefits. Examples of this potential risk are the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the shootings in San Bernardino, California in 2015, neither of which were certified as terrorism events.\nUnder TRIPRA, each participating insurer is responsible for paying a deductible of specified losses before federal assistance is available. This deductible is based on a percentage of the prior year\u2019s applicable Standard Commercial Lines and E&S Lines premiums. In 2016, our deductible is approximately $280 million. For losses above the deductible, the federal government will pay 84% of losses to an industry limit of $100 billion, and the insurer retains 16%. The federal share of losses will be reduced by 1% each year to 80% by 2020. Although TRIPRA\u2019s provisions will mitigate our loss exposure to a large-scale terrorist attack, our deductible is substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nTRIPRA rescinded all previously approved coverage exclusions for terrorism. Many of the states in which we write commercial property insurance mandate that we cover fire following an act of terrorism regardless of whether the insured specifically purchased terrorism coverage. Likewise, terrorism coverage cannot be excluded from workers compensation policies in any state in which we write.\nPersonal lines of business have never been covered under TRIPRA. Homeowners policies within our Standard Personal Lines exclude nuclear losses, but do not exclude biological or chemical losses.\nOur ability to reduce our risk exposure depends on the availability and cost of reinsurance.\nWe transfer a portion of our underwriting risk exposure to reinsurance companies. Through our reinsurance arrangements, a specified portion of our losses and loss expenses are assumed by the reinsurer in exchange for a specified portion of premiums. The availability, amount, and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions, which may vary significantly. Most of our reinsurance contracts renew annually and may be impacted by the market conditions at the time of the renewal that are unrelated to our specific book of business or experience. Any decrease in the amount of our reinsurance will increase our risk of loss. Any increase in the cost of reinsurance that cannot be included in renewal price increases will reduce our earnings. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms. Either could adversely affect our ability to write future business or result in the assumption of more risk with respect to those policies we issue.\nWe are exposed to credit risk.\nWe are exposed to credit risk in several areas of our insurance segments, including from:\n\u2022\nOur reinsurers, who are obligated to us under our reinsurance agreements. The relatively small size of the reinsurance market and our objective to maintain an average weighted rating of \u201cA\u201d by A.M. Best on our current reinsurance programs constrains our ability to diversify this credit risk. However, some of our reinsurance credit risk is collateralized.\n\u2022\nCertain life insurance companies that are obligated to our customers, as we have purchased annuities from them under structured settlement agreements.\n\u2022\nSome of our distribution partners, who collect premiums from our customers and are required to remit the collected premium to us.\n\u2022\nSome of our customers, who are responsible for payment of premiums and/or deductibles directly to us.\n\u2022\nThe invested assets in our defined benefit plan, which partially serve to fund our liability associated with this plan. To the extent that credit risk adversely impacts the valuation and performance of the invested assets within our defined benefit plan, the funded status of the defined benefit plan could be adversely impacted and, as result, could increase the cost of the plan to us.\nOur exposure to credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nDifficult conditions in global capital markets and the economy may adversely affect our revenue and profitability and harm our business, and these conditions may not improve in the near future.\nGeneral economic conditions in the United States and throughout the world and volatility in financial and insurance markets may materially affect our results of operations. Factors such as business and consumer confidence, unemployment levels, consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and, indirectly, the amount and profitability of our business. During 2015, 34% of DPW in our Standard Commercial Lines business were based on payroll/sales of our underlying customers. An economic downturn in which our customers decline in revenue or employee count can adversely affect our audit and endorsement premium in our Standard Commercial Lines.\nUnfavorable economic developments could adversely affect our earnings if our customers have less need for insurance coverage, cancel existing insurance policies, modify coverage, or choose not to renew with us. Challenging economic conditions may impair the ability of our customers to pay premiums as they come due. Although economic conditions have consistently improved over the last several years, many fundamental concerns still exist, which may have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nA downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could result in a loss of business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial strength ratings, as issued by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (\"NRSROs\"), are as follows:\nA significant rating downgrade, particularly from A.M. Best, would affect our ability to write new or renewal business with customers, some of whom are required under various third party agreements to maintain insurance with a carrier that maintains a specified minimum rating. In addition, our $30 million line of credit (\"Line of Credit\") requires our Insurance Subsidiaries to maintain an A.M. Best rating of at least \u201cA-\u201d (one level below our current rating) and a default could lead to acceleration of any outstanding principal. Such an event could trigger default provisions under certain of our other debt instruments and negatively impact our ability to borrow in the future. As a result, any significant downgrade in our financial strength ratings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nNRSROs also rate our long-term debt creditworthiness. Credit ratings indicate the ability of debt issuers to meet debt obligations in a timely manner and are important factors in our overall funding profile and ability to access certain types of liquidity. Our current senior credit ratings are as follows:\nDowngrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including making it more expensive for us to access capital markets. We cannot predict possible actions NRSROs may take regarding our ratings that could adversely affect our business or the possible actions we may take in response to any such actions.\nWe have many competitors and potential competitors.\nDemand for insurance is influenced by prevailing general economic conditions. The supply of insurance is related to prevailing prices, the levels of insured losses and the levels of industry capital which, in turn, may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the insurance industry. In addition, pricing is influenced by the operating performance of insurers as increased pricing may be necessary to meet return on equity objectives. As a result, the insurance industry\nhistorically has been through cycles characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity and periods when shortages of capacity and poor operating performance by insurers drives favorable premium levels. If competitors price business below technical levels, we might reduce our profit margin in order to retain our best business.\nPricing and loss trends impact our profitability. For example, assuming retention and all other factors remain constant:\n\u2022\nA pure price decline of approximately 1% would increase our statutory combined ratio by approximately 0.75 points;\n\u2022\nA 3% increase in our expected claim costs for the year would cause our loss and loss expense ratio to increase by approximately 1.75 points; and\n\u2022\nA combination of the two could raise the combined ratio by approximately 2.5 points.\nWe compete with regional, national, and direct-writer property and casualty insurance companies for customers, distribution partners, and employees. Some competitors are public companies and some are mutual companies. Many competitors are larger and may have lower operating costs and/or lower cost of capital. They may have the ability to absorb greater risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings. Consequently, some competitors may be able to price their products more competitively. These competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our products and services, particularly as competitors seek to win market share, and may impair our ability to maintain or increase our profitability. Because of its relatively low cost of entry, the Internet has emerged as a significant place of new competition, both from existing competitors and new competitors. Additionally, reinsurers have entered certain primary property casualty insurance markets to diversify their operations and compete with us. Further new competition could cause changes in the supply or demand for insurance and adversely affect our business.\nWe have less loss experience data than our larger competitors.\nWe believe that insurance companies are competing and will continue to compete on their ability to use reliable data about their customers and loss experience in complex analytics and predictive models to assess profitability of the risk, as well as the potential for adverse claim development, recovery opportunities, fraudulent activities, and customer buying habits. With the consistent expansion of computing power and the decline in its cost, we believe that data and analytics use will continue to increase and become more complex and accurate. As a regional insurance group, the loss experience from our insurance operations is not large enough in all circumstances to analyze and project our future costs. In addition, we have limited data regarding our E&S business, which we assumed in 2011 and began writing directly in 2012. We use data from ISO, NCCI, and AAIS to obtain sufficient industry loss experience data. While statistically relevant, that data is not specific to the performance of risks we have underwritten. Larger competitors, particularly national carriers, have significantly more data regarding the performance of risks that they have underwritten. The analytics of their loss experience data may be more predictive of profitability of their risks than our analysis using, in part, general industry loss experience. For the same reason, should Congress repeal the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which provides an anti-trust exemption for the aggregation of loss data, and we are unable to access data from ISO, NCCI, and AAIS, we will be at a competitive disadvantage to larger insurers who have more sufficient loss experience data on their own customers.\nWe depend on distribution partners.\nWe market and sell our insurance products through distribution partners who are not our employees. We believe that these partners will remain a significant force in overall insurance industry premium production because they can provide customers with a wider choice of insurance products than if they represented only one insurer. That, however, creates competition in our distribution channel and we must market our products and services to our distribution partners before they sell them to our mutual customers. Additionally, there has been a trend towards increased levels of consolidation of these distribution partners in the marketplace, which increases competition among fewer distributors. Our Standard Personal Lines production is further limited by the fact that independent retail insurance agencies only write approximately 35% of this business in the United States. Our financial condition and results of operations are tied to the successful marketing and sales efforts of our products by our distribution partners. In addition, under insurance laws and regulations and common law, we potentially can be held liable for business practices or actions taken by our distribution partners.\nWe face risks regarding our flood business because of uncertainties regarding the NFIP.\nWe are the sixth largest insurance group participating in the WYO arrangement of the NFIP, which is managed by the Mitigation Division of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\u201cFEMA\u201d) in the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. For WYO participation, we receive an expense allowance for policies written and a servicing fee for claims administered. Under the program, all losses are 100% reinsured by the Federal Government. Currently, the expense allowance is 30.9% of direct premiums written. The servicing fee is the combination of 0.9% of DPW and 1.5% of incurred losses.\nThe NFIP is funded by Congress and in 2012, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (\u201cBiggert-Waters Act\u201d). The Biggert-Waters Act: (i) extended NFIP funding to September 30, 2017; and (ii) moved the program to more market based rates for certain flood policyholders. FEMA implemented these rates throughout 2013, which created significant public discontent and Congressional concern over the impact of the new rates on NFIP customers.\nConsequently, Congress passed and, on March 21, 2014, the President signed into law, the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 (\u201cFlood Affordability Act\u201d). The Flood Affordability Act substantially modifies certain provisions of the Biggert-Waters Act, including the reversal of certain rate increases resulting in premium refunds for many NFIP policyholders that began after October 1, 2014. Effective April 2015, the Flood Affordability Act effectuated certain changes to the NFIP, including: (i) an increase in the Reserve Fund Assessment; (ii) implementation of an annual surcharge on all new and renewal policies; (iii) an additional deductible option; and (iv) increases in the federal policy fee and basic rates.\nAs a WYO carrier, we are required to follow certain NFIP procedures when administering flood policies and claims. Some of these requirements may differ from our normal business practices and may present a reputational risk to our brand. Insurance companies are regulated by states; however, the NFIP is a federal program. Consequently, we have the risk that regulatory positions taken by the NFIP and a state regulator on the same issue may conflict.\nDespite the passage of the Flood Affordability Act, the role of the NFIP program remains under scrutiny by policymakers. Additionally, our flood business could be impacted by: (i) a mandate for primary insurance carriers to provide flood insurance; or (ii) private writers becoming more prevalent in the marketplace. The uncertainty behind the public policy debate and politics of flood insurance reform make it difficult for us to predict the future of the NFIP and our continued participation in the program.\nWe are heavily regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability, increase our capital requirements, and/or limit our growth.\nOur Insurance Subsidiaries are heavily regulated by extensive laws and regulations that may change on short notice. The primary public policy behind insurance regulation is the protection of policyholders and claimants over all other constituencies, including shareholders. Historically, and by virtue of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, our Insurance Subsidiaries are primarily regulated by the states in which they are domiciled and licensed. State insurance regulation is generally uniform throughout the U.S. by virtue of similar laws and regulations required by the NAIC to accredit state insurance departments so their examinations can be given full faith and credit by other state regulators. Despite their general similarity, various provisions of these laws and regulations vary from state to state. At any given time, there may be various legislative and regulatory proposals in each of the 50 states and District of Columbia that, if enacted, may affect our Insurance Subsidiaries.\nThe broad regulatory, administrative, and supervisory powers of the various state departments of insurance include the following:\n\u2022\nRelated to our financial condition, review and approval of such matters as minimum capital and surplus requirements, standards of solvency, security deposits, methods of accounting, form and content of statutory financial statements, reserves for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses, reinsurance, payment of dividends and other distributions to shareholders, periodic financial examinations, and annual and other report filings.\n\u2022\nRelated to our general business, review and approval of such matters as certificates of authority and other insurance company licenses, licensing and compensation of distribution partners, premium rates (which may not be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory), policy forms, policy terminations, reporting of statistical information regarding our premiums and losses, periodic market conduct examinations, unfair trade practices, participation in mandatory shared market mechanisms, such as assigned risk pools and reinsurance pools, participation in mandatory state guaranty funds, and mandated continuing workers compensation coverage post-termination of employment.\n\u2022\nRelated to our ownership of the Insurance Subsidiaries, we are required to register as an insurance holding company system in each state where an insurance subsidiary is domiciled and report information concerning all of our operations that may materially affect the operations, management, or financial condition of the insurers. As an insurance holding company, the appropriate state regulatory authority may: (i) examine us or our Insurance Subsidiaries at any time; (ii) require disclosure or prior approval of material transactions of any of the Insurance Subsidiaries with its affiliates; and (iii) require prior approval or notice of certain transactions, such as payment of dividends or distributions to us.\nAlthough Congress has largely delegated insurance regulation to the various states by virtue of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, we are also subject to federal legislation and administrative policies, such as disclosure under the securities laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, TRIPRA, OFAC, and various privacy laws, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and the policies of the Federal Trade Commission. As a result of issuing workers compensation policies, we are subject to Mandatory Medicare Secondary Payer Reporting under the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007.\nThe European Union has enacted Solvency II, which sets out new requirements on capital adequacy and risk management for insurers operating in Europe, which was implemented in 2016. The strengthened regime is intended to reduce the possibility of consumer loss or market disruption in insurance. In addition, in 2014, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors proposed Basic Capital Standards for Global Systemically Important Insurers as well as a uniform capital framework for internationally active insurers. Although Solvency II does not govern domestic American insurers and we do not have international operations, we believe that development of global capital standards will influence the development of similar standards by domestic regulators. The NAIC has recently adopted ORSA, which requires insurers to maintain a framework for identifying, assessing, monitoring, managing, and reporting on the \u201cmaterial and relevant risks\u201d associated with the insurer's (or insurance group's) current and future business plans. ORSA, which has been adopted by the state insurance regulators of our Insurance Subsidiaries, requires companies to file an internal assessment of their solvency with insurance regulators annually. Although no specific capital adequacy standard is currently articulated in ORSA, it is possible that such a standard will be developed over time and may increase insurers' minimum capital requirements, which could adversely impact our growth and return on equity.\nWe are subject to non-governmental regulators, such as the NASDAQ Stock Market and the New York Stock Exchange where we list our securities. Many of these regulators, to some degree, overlap with each other on various matters. They have different regulations on the same legal issues that are subject to their individual interpretative discretion. Consequently, we have the risk that one regulator\u2019s position may conflict with another regulator\u2019s position on the same issue. As compliance is generally reviewed in hindsight, we are subject to the risk that interpretations will change over time.\nWe believe we are in compliance with all laws and regulations that have a material effect on our results of operations, but the cost of complying with various, potentially conflicting laws and regulations, and changes in those laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nWe are subject to the risk that legislation will be passed that significantly changes insurance regulation and adversely impacts our business, financial condition, and/or the results of operations.\nIn 2009, the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted to address the financial markets crises in 2008 and 2009 and issues regarding American International Group, Inc. The Dodd-Frank Act created the FIO as part of the U.S. Department of Treasury to advise the federal government regarding insurance issues. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the Federal Reserve through the Financial Services Oversight Council (\u201cFSOC\u201d) to supervise financial services firms designated as systemically important financial institutions (\"SIFI\"). The FSOC has not designated Selective as a SIFI. The Dodd-Frank Act also included a number of corporate governance reforms for publicly traded companies, including proxy access, say-on-pay, and other compensation and governance issues. We anticipate that there will continue to be legislative proposals in Congress that could result in the federal government becoming directly involved in the regulation of insurance. There are also legislative and regulatory proposals in the various states that seek to limit the ability of carriers to properly assess insurance risk.\n\u2022\nRepeal of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. While recent proposals for McCarran-Ferguson Act repeal have been directed primarily at health insurers, if enacted and applicable to property and casualty insurers, such repeal would significantly reduce our ability to compete and materially affect our results of operations because we rely on the anti-trust exemptions the law provides to obtain loss data from third party aggregators, such as ISO and NCCI, to predict future losses. Our inability to access data from ISO and NCCI would put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to larger insurers who have more sufficient loss experience data with their own customers.\n\u2022\nHealthcare reform. The enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the \u201cHealthcare Act\u201d) may have an impact on various aspects of our business, including our insurance segments. The Healthcare Act reduces the reimbursement to healthcare providers, which may result in healthcare providers charging more to insurers not covered under the Healthcare Act. This could increase our cost to provide workers compensation, automobile Personal Injury Protection and general liability coverages, among others. In addition, we will continue to be impacted as a business enterprise by potential tax issues and changes in employee benefits. The Healthcare Act has been adopted, its implementation is ongoing, and we continue to monitor and assess its impact.\n\u2022\nChanges in rules for Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"). In 2013, HUD finalized a new \"disparate impact\" regulation that may adversely impact insurers' ability to differentiate pricing for homeowners policies using traditional risk selection analysis. Various legal challenges to this regulation continue to be pursued in courts, including the applicability of the regulation to the business of insurance. It is uncertain to what extent the application of this regulation will impact the property and casualty industry and underwriting practices, but it could increase litigation costs, force changes in underwriting practices, and impair our ability to write homeowners business profitably. The outcome of the pending legal challenges and potential rulemaking cannot be predicted at this time.\n\u2022\nState Regulatory and Legislative Limits to Underwriting. From time-to-time, there are proposals in various states seeking to limit the ability of insurers to use certain factors or predictive measures in the underwriting of property and casualty risks. Among the proposed legislation and regulation have been limits on the use of insurance scores and marketplace considerations. These proposals, if enacted, could impact underwriting pricing and results.\nWe expect the debate about the role of the federal government in regulating insurance to continue.\nWe cannot predict whether any of the above discussed proposed rules or legislation will be adopted, or what impact, if any, such proposals or the cost of compliance with such proposals, could have on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings if enacted.\nClass action litigation could affect our business practices and financial results.\nOur industry has been the target of class action litigation, including the following areas:\n\u2022\nAfter-market parts;\n\u2022\nUrban homeowner insurance underwriting practices, including those related to architectural or structural features and attempts by federal regulators to expand the Federal Housing Administration's guidelines to determine unfair discrimination;\n\u2022\nCredit scoring and predictive modeling pricing;\n\u2022\nCybersecurity breaches;\n\u2022\nInvestment disclosure;\n\u2022\nManaged care practices;\n\u2022\nTiming and discounting of personal injury protection claims payments;\n\u2022\nDirect repair shop utilization practices;\n\u2022\nFlood insurance claim practices; and\n\u2022\nShareholder class action suits.\nIf we were to be named in such class action litigation, we could suffer reputational harm with purchasers of insurance and have increased litigation expenses that could have a materially adverse effect on our operations or results.\nChanges in tax legislation initiatives could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state, and local governments, which may change in ways that adversely impact us. For example, federal tax legislation could be enacted that reduces the existing statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35%, thereby reducing any deferred tax assets. This would require that we recognize, in full, a reduction of a previously-recognized federal tax benefit in the period when enacted, and, along with other changes in the tax rules that may increase our actual tax expense, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Investment Segment\nWe are exposed to interest rate and credit risk in our investment portfolio.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk primarily related to the market price, and cash flow variability, associated with changes in interest rates. A rise in interest rates may decrease the fair value of our existing fixed income investments and declines in interest rates may result in an increase in the fair value of our existing fixed income investments. Our fixed income investment portfolio, which currently has a duration of 3.8 years excluding short term investments, contains interest rate sensitive instruments that may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates resulting from governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control. A rise in interest rates would decrease the net unrealized gain position of the investment portfolio, partially offset by our ability to earn higher rates of return on funds reinvested in new investments. Conversely, a decline in interest rates would increase the net unrealized gain position of the investment portfolio, partially offset by lower rates of return on new and reinvested cash in the portfolio. Changes in interest rates have an effect on the calculated duration of certain securities in the portfolio. We seek to mitigate our\ninterest rate risk associated with holding fixed income investments by monitoring and maintaining the average duration of our portfolio with a view toward achieving an adequate after-tax return without subjecting the portfolio to an unreasonable level of interest rate risk. Although we take measures to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to mitigate the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities, particularly our loss reserves. In addition, our pension and post-retirement benefit obligations include a discount rate assumption, which is an important element of expense and/or liability measurement. Changes in the discount rate assumption could materially impact our pension and post-retirement life valuation.\nThe value of our investment portfolio is subject to credit risk from the issuers and/or guarantors of the securities in the portfolio, other counterparties in certain transactions and, for certain securities, insurers that guarantee specific issuer\u2019s obligations. Defaults by the issuer or an issuer\u2019s guarantor, insurer, or other counterparties regarding any of our investments, could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains or result in investment losses. We are subject to the risk that the issuers, or guarantors, of fixed income securities we own may default on principal and interest payments due under the terms of the securities. At December 31, 2015, our fixed income securities portfolio represented approximately\n91% of our total invested assets. The occurrence of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening credit spreads, budgetary deficits, municipal bankruptcies spurred by, among other things, pension funding issues, or other events that adversely affect the issuers or guarantors of these securities could cause the value of our fixed income securities portfolio and our net income to decline and the default rate of our fixed income securities portfolio to increase.\nWith economic uncertainty, credit quality of issuers or guarantors could be adversely affected and a ratings downgrade of the issuers or guarantors of the securities in our portfolio could cause the value of our fixed income securities portfolio and our net income to decrease. As our stockholders' equity is leveraged at 3.6:1 to our investment portfolio, a reduction in the value of our investment portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and debt ratings. Levels of write downs are impacted by our assessment of the impairment, including a review of the underlying collateral of structured securities, and our intent and ability to hold securities that have declined in value until recovery. If we reposition or realign portions of the portfolio so that we determine not to hold certain securities in an unrealized loss position to recovery, we will incur an OTTI charge. For further information regarding credit and interest rate risk, see Item 7A. \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nOur statutory surplus may be materially affected by rating downgrades on investments held in our portfolio.\nWe are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risks, primarily relating to interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, and the change in market value of our alternative investment portfolio. A decline in both income and our investment portfolio asset values could occur as a result of, among other things, a decrease in market liquidity, fluctuations in interest rates, decreased dividend payment rates, negative market perception of credit risk with respect to types of securities in our portfolio, a decline in the performance of the underlying collateral of our structured securities, reduced returns on our alternative investment portfolio, or general market conditions. A global decline in asset values will be more amplified in our financial condition, as our statutory surplus is leveraged at a 3.5:1 ratio to our investment portfolio.\nWith economic uncertainty, the credit quality and ratings of securities in our portfolio could be adversely affected. The NAIC could potentially apply a more adverse class code on a security than was originally assigned, which could adversely affect statutory surplus because securities with NAIC class codes three through six require securities to be marked-to-market for statutory accounting purposes, as compared to securities with NAIC class codes of one or two that are carried at amortized cost.\nDeterioration in the public debt and equity markets, the private investment marketplace, and the economy could lead to investment losses, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and debt ratings.\nLike most property and casualty insurance companies, we depend on income from our investment portfolio for a significant portion of our revenue and earnings. Our investment portfolio is exposed to significant financial and capital market risks, both in the U.S. and abroad, and volatile changes in general market or economic conditions could lead to a decline in the market value of our portfolio as well as the performance of the underlying collateral of our structured securities. Concerns over weak economic growth globally, elevated unemployment, volatile energy and commodity prices, and geopolitical issues, among other factors, contribute to increased volatility in the financial markets, increased potential for credit downgrades, and decreased liquidity in certain investment segments.\nOur notes payable and Line of Credit are subject to certain debt-to-capitalization restrictions and net worth covenants, which could be impacted by a significant decline in investment value. Further OTTI charges could be necessary if there is a future significant decline in investment values. Depending on market conditions going forward, and in the event of extreme prolonged market events, such as the global credit crisis, we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, debt and financial strength ratings, and our ability to access capital markets as a result of realized losses, impairments, and changes in unrealized positions.\nFor more information regarding market interest rate, credit, and equity price risk, see Item 7A. \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nThere can be no assurance that the actions of the U.S. Government, Federal Reserve, and other governmental and regulatory bodies will achieve their intended effect.\nOver the past several years, the Federal Reserve has taken a number of actions related to interest rates and purchasing of financial instruments intended to spur economic recovery. The Federal Reserve's policy of quantitative easing and low interest rates since the financial crisis of 2008 have had an adverse effect on our investment income, as higher yielding securities mature and we reinvest the proceeds at lower yields. In December 2015, the Federal Reserve increased the Federal Fund Rate by 25 basis points. If this rate were to continue to be systematically increased, we are uncertain of what the effect would be on the broad financial markets. Increased pressure on the price of our fixed income and equity portfolios may occur if these economic stimulus actions by the Federal Reserve are not as effective as originally intended. These results could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock. In the event of future material deterioration in business conditions, we may need to raise additional capital or consider other transactions to manage our capital position.\nIn addition, our investment activities are subject to extensive laws and regulations that are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities and non-governmental self-regulatory agencies. In light of the current economic conditions, some of these authorities have implemented, or may in the future implement, new or enhanced regulatory requirements, such as those included in the Dodd-Frank Act, intended to restore confidence in financial institutions and reduce the likelihood of similar economic events in the future. These authorities may seek to exercise their supervisory and enforcement authority in new or more robust ways. Such events could affect the way we conduct our business and manage our capital, and may require us to satisfy increased capital requirements. These developments, if they occurred, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nWe are subject to the types of risks inherent in investing in private limited partnerships.\nOur other investments include investments in private limited partnerships that invest in various strategies, such as private equity, private credit, and real assets. Since these partnerships\u2019 underlying investments consist primarily of assets or liabilities for which there are no quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar assets, the valuation of interests in these partnerships is subject to a higher level of subjectivity and unobservable inputs than substantially all of our other investments and as such, is subject to greater scrutiny and reconsideration from one reporting period to the next. As these investments are recorded under the equity method of accounting, any decreases in the valuation of these investments would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe value our investments using methodologies, estimations, and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations. Changes in these interpretations could result in fluctuations in the valuations of our investments that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nFixed income, equity, and short-term investments, which are reported at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, represented the majority of our total cash and invested assets as of December 31, 2015. As required under accounting rules, we have categorized these securities into a three-level hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1). The next priority is to quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or in markets that are not active and other inputs that can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities (Level 2). The lowest priority in the fair value hierarchy is to unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and that reflect the reporting entity\u2019s own assumptions about the exit price, including assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (Level 3).\nAn asset or liability\u2019s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to its valuation. We generally use an independent pricing service and broker quotes to price our investment securities. At December 31, 2015, approximately 9% and 91% of these securities represented Level 1 and Level 2, respectively. However, prices provided by independent pricing services and brokers can vary widely even for the same security. Rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements (\u201cFinancial Statements\u201d) and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may result in an increase in non-cash OTTI charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nThe determination of the amount of impairments taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our results of operations or our financial position.\nThe determination of the amount of impairments taken on our investments is based on our periodic evaluation and assessment of our investments and known and inherent risks associated with the various asset classes. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in impairments as such evaluations are revised. There can be no assurance that management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken as reflected in our Financial Statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken in the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments. For further information regarding our evaluation and considerations for determining whether a security is other-than-temporarily impaired, please refer to \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d in Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in tax legislation initiatives could adversely affect our investments results.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state, and local governments, which may change in ways that adversely impact us. Our investment portfolio has benefited from tax exemptions and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends received deductions and tax-advantaged municipal bond interest. Federal and/or state tax legislation could be enacted that would lessen or eliminate some or all of the tax advantages currently benefiting us. This could negatively impact the value of our investment portfolio and, in turn, materially and adversely impact our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure and Governance\nWe are a holding company and our ability to declare dividends to our shareholders, pay indebtedness, and enter into affiliate transactions may be limited because our Insurance Subsidiaries are regulated.\nRestrictions on the ability of the Insurance Subsidiaries to pay dividends, make loans or advances to us, or enter into transactions with affiliates may materially affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or repay our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Parent had stand-alone retained earnings of $1.4 billion. Of this amount, $1.3 billion is related to investments in our Insurance Subsidiaries. The Insurance Subsidiaries have the ability to provide for $178 million in annual ordinary dividends to us under applicable state regulation; however, as they are regulated entities, their ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances to us is subject to the approval or review of the insurance regulators in the states where they are domiciled. The standards for review of such transactions are whether: (i) the terms and charges are fair and reasonable; and (ii) after the transaction, the Insurance Subsidiary's surplus for policyholders is reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and financial needs. Although dividends and loans to us from our Insurance Subsidiaries historically have been approved, we can make no assurance that future dividends and loans will be approved. For additional details regarding dividend restrictions, see Note 19. \u201cStatutory Financial Information, Capital Requirements, and Restrictions on Dividends and Transfers of Funds\u201d in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" of this Form 10-K.\nBecause we are an insurance holding company and a New Jersey corporation, we may be less attractive to potential acquirers and the value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nBecause we are an insurance holding company that owns insurance subsidiaries, anyone who seeks to acquire 10% or more of our stock must seek prior approval from the insurance regulators in the states in which the subsidiaries are organized and file extensive information regarding their business operations and finances.\nProvisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation may discourage, delay, or prevent us from being acquired, including:\n\u2022\nSupermajority shareholder voting requirements to approve certain business combinations with interested shareholders (as defined in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) unless certain other conditions are satisfied; and\n\u2022\nSupermajority shareholder voting requirements to amend the foregoing provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.\nIn addition to the requirements in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the New Jersey Shareholders\u2019 Protection Act also prohibits us from engaging in certain business combinations with interested stockholders (as defined in the statute), in certain instances for a five-year period, and in other instances indefinitely, unless certain conditions are satisfied. These conditions may relate to, among other things, the interested stockholder\u2019s acquisition of stock, the approval of the business combination by disinterested members of our Board of Directors and disinterested stockholders, and the price and payment of the consideration proposed in the business combination. Such conditions are in addition to those requirements set forth in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.\nThese provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and New Jersey law could have the effect of depriving our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium over our common stock\u2019s prevailing market price in the event of a hostile takeover and may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our General Operations\nThe failure of our risk management strategies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAs an insurance provider, it is our business to take on risk from our customers. Our long-term strategy includes use of above average operational leverage, which can be measured as the ratio of NPW to our equity or policyholders surplus. We balance operational leverage risk with a number of risk management strategies within our insurance operations to achieve a balance of growth and profit and to reduce our exposure. These strategies include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nBeing disciplined in our underwriting practices;\n\u2022\nBeing prudent in our claims management practices, establishing adequate loss and loss expense reserves, and placing appropriate reliance on our claims analytics;\n\u2022\nContinuing to develop and implement various underwriting tools and automated analytics to examine historical statistical data regarding our customers and their loss experience to: (i) classify such policies based on that information; (ii) apply that information to current and prospective accounts; and (iii) better predict account profitability;\n\u2022\nContinuing to develop our customer experience platform as we grow in our understanding of customer segmentation;\n\u2022\nPurchasing reinsurance and using catastrophe modeling; and\n\u2022\nBeing prudent in our financial planning process, which supports our underwriting strategies.\nWe also maintain a conservative approach to our investment portfolio management and employ risk management strategic that include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nBeing prudent in establishing our investment policy and appropriately diversifying our investments, which supports our liabilities and underwriting strategies;\n\u2022\nUsing complex financial and investment models to analyze historic investment performance and predict future investment performance under a variety of scenarios using asset concentration, asset volatility, asset correlation, and systematic risk; and\n\u2022\nClosely monitoring investment performance, general economic and financial conditions, and other relevant factors.\nAll of these strategies have inherent limitations. We cannot be certain that an event or series of unanticipated events will not occur and result in losses greater than we expect and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nOperational risks, including human or systems failures, are inherent in our business.\nOperational risks and losses can result from, among other things, fraud, errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization, failure to comply with regulatory requirements, information technology failures, or external events.\nWe believe that our underwriting, claims, predictive, and catastrophe modeling, as well as our business analytics and our information technology and application systems are critical to our business. We expect our information technology and application systems to remain an important part of our underwriting process and our ability to compete successfully. A major defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology and application systems could: (i) result in management distraction; (ii) harm our reputation; or (iii) increase our expenses. We believe appropriate controls and mitigation procedures are in place to prevent significant risk of a defect in our internal controls around our information technology and application systems, but internal controls provide only a reasonable, not absolute, assurance as to the absence of errors or irregularities and any ineffectiveness of such controls and procedures could have a significant and negative effect on our business.\nRapid development of new technologies may result in an unexpected impact on our business and insurance industry overall.\nDevelopment of new technologies continues to impact all aspects of business and individuals\u2019 lives at rapid speed. Often such developments are positive and gradually improve standards of living and speed of communications, and allow for the development of more efficient processes. However, rapid development of new technologies also presents challenges and risks. Examples of such emerging risks include but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nChange in exposures and claims frequency and/or severity due to unanticipated consequences of new technologies and their use. For example, technologies have been developed and are being tested for autonomous self-driving automobiles. It is unclear and we cannot predict the corresponding severity or cost of automobile claims. It is possible that these technological developments will affect the profitability and demand for automobile insurance.\n\u2022\nChanges in how insurance products are marketed and purchased due to availability of new technologies and changes in customer expectations. For example, comparative rating technologies which are widely used in personal lines insurance, facilitate the process of efficiently generating quotes from multiple insurance companies. This technology makes differentiation other than on pricing more difficult and has increased price comparison and resulted in a higher level of quote activity with a lower percentage of quotes becoming new business written. These trends may continue to accelerate and may affect other lines of business, which could put pressure on our future profitability.\n\u2022\nNew technologies may require development of new insurance products without support of sufficient historical claims data for us to continue to effectively compete for our distribution partners' business and customers.\nWe are subject to attempted cyber-attacks and other cybersecurity risks.\nThe nature of our business requires that we store and use significant amounts of personally identifiable information in electronic format that may be targeted in an attempted cybersecurity breach. In addition, our business is heavily reliant on various information technology and application systems that may be impacted by a malicious cyber-attack. These cyber incidents may cause lost revenues or increased expenses stemming from reputational damage and fines related to the breach of personally identifiable information, inability to use certain systems for a period of time, loss of financial assets, remediation and litigation costs, and increased cybersecurity protection costs. We have developed and continue to invest in a variety of controls to prevent, detect, and appropriately react to such cyber-attacks, including frequently testing our systems' security and access controls. However, cybersecurity risks continue to become more complex and broad ranging and our internal controls provide only a reasonable, not absolute, assurance that we will be able to protect ourselves from significant cyber-attack incidents. By outsourcing certain business and administrative functions to third parties, we may be exposed to enhanced risk of data security breaches. Any breach of data security could damage our reputation and/or result in monetary damages, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings. Although we have not experienced a material cyber-attack, we purchase insurance coverage to specifically address cybersecurity risks. The coverage provides protection up to $20 million above a deductible of $250,000 for various cybersecurity risks, including privacy breach related incidents.\nWe depend on key personnel.\nTo a large extent, our business' success depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees. Competition to attract and retain key personnel is intense. While we have employment agreements with certain key managers, all of our employees are at-will employees and we cannot ensure that we will be able to attract and retain key personnel. As of December 31, 2015, our workforce had an average age of approximately 47 and approximately 25% of our workforce was retirement eligible under our retirement and benefit plans.\nIf we experience difficulties with outsourcing relationships, our ability to conduct our business might be negatively impacted.\nWe outsource certain business and administrative functions to third parties for efficiencies and cost savings, and may do so increasingly in the future. If we fail to develop and implement our outsourcing strategies or our third-party providers fail to perform as anticipated, we may experience operational difficulties, increased costs, and a loss of business that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Currently, we have agreements with multiple consulting, information technology, and service providers for supplemental staffing services. Collectively, these providers supply approximately 46% of our skilled technology capacity.\nWe are subject to a variety of modeling risks, which could have a material adverse impact on our business results.\nWe rely on complex financial models, such as predictive modeling, a claims fraud model, third party catastrophe models, an enterprise risk management capital model, and modeling tools used by our investment managers, which have been developed internally or by third parties to analyze historical loss costs and pricing, trends in claims severity and frequency, the occurrence of catastrophe losses, investment performance, and portfolio risk. Flaws in these financial models, or faulty assumptions used by these financial models, could lead to increased losses. We believe that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling risk. Therefore, such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management.", "PERMNO": 68292, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "SIGI"}
