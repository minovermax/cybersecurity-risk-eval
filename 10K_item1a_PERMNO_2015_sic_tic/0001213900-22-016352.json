RISK FACTORS.\nSummary Risk Factors\nWe face risks and uncertainties related to our business, many of which are beyond our control. In particular, risks associated with our business include:\n\u25cf we are a clinical stage biotechnology company that had no revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, and do not anticipate generating revenue for the near future;\n\u25cf our need for additional financing, both near term and long term, to support our operations, our ability to raise such financing as needed, the terms of such financing, if available, potential significant dilution associated therewith, and covenants and restrictions we may need to comply with in connection with such funding;\n\u25cf our dependence on the success of our future product candidates, some of which may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized; problems in our manufacturing process for our new products and/or our failure to comply with manufacturing regulations, or unexpected increases in our manufacturing costs; problems with distribution of our products; and failure to adequately market our products;\n\u25cf risks associated with the growth of our business, our ability to maintain such growth, difficulties in managing our growth, and executing our growth strategy;\n\u25cf liability for previously restated financial statements and associated with ineffective controls and procedures;\n\u25cf our dependence on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain employees;\n\u25cf risks from intense competition from companies with greater resources and experience than we have;\n\u25cf risks that our future product candidates, if approved, may be unable to achieve the expected market acceptance and, consequently, limit our ability to generate revenue from new products;\n\u25cf the outcome of currently pending and future claims and litigation, future government investigations, and other proceedings may adversely affect our business and results of operations;\n\u25cf the fact that the majority of our license agreements provide the licensors and/or counter-parties the right to use and/or exploit such licensed intellectual property;\n\u25cf preclinical studies and earlier clinical trials may not necessarily be predictive of future results and may not have favorable results; we have limited marketing experience, and our future ability to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates, even if they are approved in the future is unknown; and business interruptions could delay us in the process of developing our future product candidates and could disrupt our product sales;\n\u25cf third-party payors may not provide coverage and adequate reimbursement levels for any future products;\n\u25cf liability from lawsuits (including product liability lawsuits, stockholder lawsuits and regulatory matters), including judgments, damages, fines and penalties and including the outcome of currently pending litigation, potential future government investigations, and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business and results of operations;\n\u25cf security breaches, loss of data and other disruptions which could prevent us from accessing critical information or expose us to liabilities or damages;\n\u25cf risks associated with clinical trials that are expensive, time-consuming, uncertain and susceptible to change, delay or termination and which are open to differing interpretations;\n\u25cf our ability to comply with existing and future rules and regulations, including federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations and implementation of, or changes to, such healthcare laws and regulations;\n\u25cf delays in the trials, testing, application, or approval process for drug candidates and/or our ability to obtain approval for promising drug candidates, and the costs associated therewith;\n\u25cf our ability to adequately protect our future product candidates or our proprietary technology in the marketplace, claims and liability from third parties regarding our alleged infringement of their intellectual property;\n\u25cf differences in laws and regulations between countries and other jurisdictions;\n\u25cf changes in laws or regulations, including, but not limited to tax laws and controlled substance laws, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations;\n\u25cf conflicts of interest between our officers, directors, consultants and scientists;\n\u25cf penalties associated with our failure to comply with certain pre-agreed contractual obligations and restrictions;\n\u25cf dilution caused by future fund raising, the conversion/exercise of outstanding convertible securities, and downward pressure on the value of our securities caused by such future issuances/sales;\n\u25cf negative effects on our business from the COVID-19 pandemic and other potential future pandemics;\n\u25cf the extremely volatile nature of our securities and potential lack of liquidity therefore;\n\u25cf the fact that our Certificate of Incorporation provides for indemnification of officers and directors, limits the liability of officers and directors, allows for the authorization of preferred stock without stockholder approval, and includes certain anti-takeover provisions;\n\u25cf our ability to maintain the listing of our common stock and warrants on NASDAQ and the costs of compliance with SEC and NASDAQ rules and requirements;\n\u25cf risks associated with our status as an emerging growth company and the provisions of the JOBS Act, which we are able to take advantage of, due to such status;\n\u25cf failure of our information technology systems, including cybersecurity attacks or other data security incidents, that could significantly disrupt the operation of our business;\n\u25cf the fact that we may acquire other companies which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results and if we make any acquisitions, they may disrupt or have a negative impact on our business;\n\u25cf the fact that we may apply working capital and future funding to uses that ultimately do not improve our operating results or increase the value of our securities; and\n\u25cf our growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.\nYou should be aware that there are substantial risks for an investment in our common stock. You should carefully consider these risk factors before you decide to invest in our common stock.\nIf any of the following risks were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or other prospects, could be materially adversely effected, and the occurrence of any of these risks could materially affect our likelihood of success. If that happens, the market price of our common stock, if any, could decline, and prospective investors would lose all or part of their investment in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below. This section discusses factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, the following description of Risk Factors is not a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties applicable to our business.\nOur current cash balance is only sufficient to fund our planned business operations through the third quarter of 2022. If additional capital is not available, we may not be able to pursue our planned business operations, may be forced to change our planned business operations, or may take other actions that could adversely impact our stockholders.\nWe are a clinical stage biotechnology company that currently has no revenue. Thus, our business does not generate the cash necessary to finance our planned business operations. We will require significant additional capital to: (i) develop FDA-approved products and commercialize such products; (ii) fund research and development activities relating to, and obtain regulatory approval for, our product candidates; (iii) protect our intellectual property; (iv) attract and retain highly-qualified personnel; (v) respond effectively to competitive pressures; and (vi) acquire complementary businesses or technologies.\nOur future capital needs depend on many factors, including: (i) the scope, duration and expenditures associated with our research, development and commercialization efforts; (ii) continued scientific progress in our programs; (iii) the outcome of potential partnering or licensing transactions, if any; (iv) competing technological developments; (v) our proprietary patent position; and (vi) the regulatory approval process for our products.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or strategic alliances and licensing arrangements to finance our planned business operations. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. General market conditions, as well as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may make it difficult for us to seek financing from the capital markets, and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. For example, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, further dilution to our stockholders will result, which may substantially dilute the value of their investment. Any equity financing may also have the effect of reducing the conversion or exercise price of our outstanding convertible or exercisable securities, which could result in the issuance (or potential issuance) of a significant number of additional shares of our common stock. In addition, as a condition to providing additional funds to us, future investors may demand, and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility to conduct future business activities and, in the event of insolvency, could be paid before holders of equity securities received any distribution of our assets. We may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses through alliance, joint venture or agreements on terms that are not favorable to us, in order to raise additional funds. If adequate funds are not available, we may have to delay, reduce or eliminate one or more of our planned activities with respect to our business, or terminate our operations. These actions would likely reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe will need additional capital which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, which raises questions about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $68,682,286, net loss amounted to $20,324,648 and we had a working capital deficit of $8,498,193. As of March 28, 2022, we had cash on hand of $6,045,848. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As we are not generating revenues, we need to raise a significant amount of capital in order to pay our debts and cover our operating costs. While the Company raised money in August 2021, there is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional needed capital or that such capital will be available under favorable terms.\nWe are subject to all the substantial risks inherent in the development of a new business enterprise within an extremely competitive industry. Due to the absence of a long-standing operating history and the emerging nature of the markets in which we compete, we anticipate operating losses until we can successfully implement our business strategy, which includes all associated revenue streams. We may never ever achieve profitable operations or generate significant revenues.\nWe believe that in the aggregate, we will require significant additional capital funding to support and expand the research and development and marketing of our products, fund future clinical trials, repay debt obligations, provide capital expenditures for additional equipment and development costs, payment obligations, office space and systems for managing the business, and cover other operating costs until our planned revenue streams from products are fully-implemented and begin to offset our operating costs, if ever.\nSince our inception, we have funded our operations with the proceeds from equity and debt financings. We have experienced liquidity issues due to, among other reasons, our limited ability to raise adequate capital on acceptable terms. We have historically relied upon the issuance of equity and promissory notes that are convertible into shares of our common stock to fund our operations and have devoted significant efforts to reduce that exposure. We anticipate that we will need to issue equity to fund our operations and fund our operating expenses for the foreseeable future. If we are unable to achieve operational profitability or we are not successful in securing other forms of financing, we will have to evaluate alternative actions to reduce our operating expenses and conserve cash.\nThese conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements included herein also include a going concern footnote.\nAdditionally, wherever possible, our Board of Directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash consideration will consist of restricted shares of our common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. Our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the shareholders, but subject to NASDAQ rules and regulations (which generally require shareholder approval for any transactions which would result in the issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock), to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock, preferred stock or warrants to purchase such shares of common stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future. These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders, may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management\u2019s ability to maintain control of us, because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management.\nWe have significant and increasing liquidity needs and may require additional funding.\nResearch and development, management and administrative expenses, including legal expenses, and cash used for operations will continue to be significant and may increase substantially in the future in connection with new research and development initiatives, clinical trials, continued product commercialization efforts and the launch of our future product candidates. We will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations, continue to conduct clinical trials to support potential regulatory approval of marketing applications, and to fund commercialization of our future product candidates.\nThe amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the timing of FDA approval, if any, and approvals in international markets of our future product candidates, if at all;\n\u25cf the timing and amount of revenue from sales of our products, or revenue from grants or other sources;\n\u25cf the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other product development programs;\n\u25cf costs of establishing or outsourcing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u25cf costs and timing of any outsourced growing and commercial manufacturing supply arrangements for our future product candidates;\n\u25cf costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights associated with our future product candidates;\n\u25cf the effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u25cf personnel, facilities and equipment requirements; and\n\u25cf the terms and timing of any additional collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements that we may establish.\nWhile we expect to fund our future capital requirements from a number of sources, such as cash flow from operations and the proceeds from further public and/or private offerings, we cannot assure you that any of these funding sources will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Further, even if we can raise funds from all of the above sources, the amounts raised may not be sufficient to meet our future capital requirements.\nWe are dependent on the success of our future product candidates, some of which may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.\nOur success will depend on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our future product candidates through our development programs, including our product candidate for the treatment of Dupuytren\u2019s Contracture and any other product candidates developed through our fibrosis & anti-TNF, CBD derivatives, and \u03b17nAChR development platforms. We may never be able to develop products which receive regulatory approval in the U.S. or elsewhere. There can be no assurance that the FDA, EMA or any other regulatory authority will approve these product candidates.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our future product candidates will depend on, among other things, our ability to successfully complete pre-clinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials and to receive regulatory approvals from the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities. Delays in the regulatory process could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have recently grown our business and will need to increase the size and complexity of our organization in the future, and we may experience difficulties in managing our growth and executing our growth strategy.\nOur management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support our business plan and future growth. We will need to increase our number of full-time equivalent employees in order to conduct Phase 1, 2 and 3 clinical trials of our future products and to establish a commercial organization and commercial infrastructure. As a result of these future activities, the complexity of our business operations is expected to substantially increase. We will need to develop and expand our scientific, manufacturing, sales and marketing, managerial, compliance, operational, financial and other resources to support our planned research, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities.\nOur need to effectively manage our operations, growth and various projects requires that we:\n\u25cf continue to improve our operational, financial, management and regulatory compliance controls and reporting systems and procedures;\n\u25cf attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees;\n\u25cf manage our commercialization activities effectively and in a cost-effective manner (currently trial and development for our clinical trials is very cost effective); and\n\u25cf manage our development efforts effectively while carrying out our contractual obligations to contractors and other third parties.\nWe have utilized and continue to utilize the services of part-time outside consultants and contractors to perform a number of tasks for our company, including tasks related to compliance programs, clinical trial management, regulatory affairs, formulation development and other drug development functions. Our growth strategy may entail expanding our use of consultants and contractors to implement these and other tasks going forward. If we are not able to effectively expand our organization by hiring new employees and expanding our use of consultants and contractors, we may be unable to successfully implement the tasks necessary to effectively execute on our planned research, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities and, accordingly, may not achieve our research, development and commercialization goals.\nWe face liability for previously restated financial statements.\nWe filed a Current Report on Form 8-K on December 31, 2020 and another Current Report on Form 8-K on February 3, 2021, where we announced that due to matters we discovered which related to KBL, prior to the Business Combination, certain historical financial statements were unreliable. As a result, we restated our financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2020 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, because of errors in such financial statements which were identified after such financial statements were filed with the SEC in our original quarterly reports for the quarters ended June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020. While we believe these restatements are the result of the actions of, and are the responsibility of, the management of KBL (none of whom remain employed by the Company), we may be subject to stockholder litigation, rating downgrades, negative publicity and difficulties in attracting and retaining key clients, employees and management personnel as a result of such restatements. Additionally, our securities may trade at prices lower than similarly situated companies which have not had to restate their financial statements.\nOur failure to appropriately account for complex financial instruments may result in the requirement that we restate our financial statements.\nCertain of our current securities, and future securities we issue may, require complex accounting treatment and analysis. The SEC recently issued a Statement on Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants Issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (\u201cSPACs\u201d)(the \u201cStatement\u201d) on April 12, 2021 and may in the future issue further statements on SPAC accounting. While we believe that our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, and for the quarters ended March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021, comply with the guidance issued on April 12, 2021, it is possible that as a result of the information and guidance set forth in the Statement, or in future statements or advisories released by the SEC or an accounting standards board, that we will need to restate our financial statements, and such guidance (including as set forth in the Statement), could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for prior periods which are required to be restated, if any, and/or on future periods moving forward, even if a restatement is not required. We do not believe that the SEC\u2019s prior guidance regarding the accounting treatment of redeemable shares issued by SPACs will require a restatement of our historical financial statements or will have any impact on the financial statements that we plan to prepare and file in the future.\nOperating results may vary significantly in future periods.\nOur financial results are unpredictable and may fluctuate, for among other reasons, due to commercial sales of our future product candidates; our achievement of product development objectives and milestones; clinical trial enrollment and expenses; research and development expenses; and the timing and nature of contract manufacturing and contract research payments. A high portion of our costs are predetermined on an annual basis, due in part to our significant research and development costs. Thus, small declines in future revenue could disproportionately affect financial results in a quarter.\nWe depend on our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain employees.\nOur future growth and success depend on our ability to recruit, retain, manage and motivate our employees. We are highly dependent on our current management and scientific personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. James N. Woody, our Co-Chairmen, Sir Marc Feldmann, Ph.D., and Lawrence Steinman, M.D., our Chief Scientific Officer, Jonathan Rothbard, Ph.D., our Chief Operating Officer / Chief Business Officer, Quan Anh Vu, and our scientists, Raphael Mechoulam and Jagdeep Nanchahal. The inability to hire or retain experienced management personnel could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results. Due to the specialized scientific and managerial nature of our business, we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. The competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnological field is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel.\nProblems in our manufacturing process for our new chemical entities, failure to comply with manufacturing regulations or unexpected increases in our manufacturing costs could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are responsible for the manufacture and supply of our future product candidates in the CBD derivatives and \u03b17nAChR programs for commercial use and for use in clinical trials. The manufacturing of our future product candidates necessitates compliance with GMPs and other regulatory requirements in international jurisdictions. Our ability to successfully manufacture our future product candidates will involve manufacture of finished products and labeling and packaging, which includes product information, tamper proof evidence and anti-counterfeit features, under tightly controlled processes and procedures. In addition, we will have to ensure chemical consistency among our batches, including clinical trial batches and, if approved, marketing batches. Demonstrating such consistency may require typical manufacturing controls as well as clinical data. We will also have to ensure that our batches conform to complex release specifications. If we are unable to manufacture our future product candidates in accordance with regulatory specifications, or if there are disruptions in our manufacturing process due to damage, loss or otherwise, or failure to pass regulatory inspections of our manufacturing facilities, we may not be able to meet demand or supply sufficient product for use in clinical trials, and this may also harm our ability to commercialize our future product candidates on a timely or cost-competitive basis, if at all.\nWe may not develop and expand our manufacturing capability in time to meet demand for our product candidates, and the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may not accept our facilities or those of our contract manufacturers as being suitable for the production of our products and product candidates. Any problems in our manufacturing process could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur memorandum of understanding with Celltrion Healthcare may not result in the parties entering into a definitive agreement.\nIn September 2021, we entered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding with Celltrion Healthcare, a biopharmaceutical company, for the supply of an anti-TNF biosimilar drug used in our ongoing development of anti-TNF products. The parties have not entered into a definitive agreement regarding such relationship to date, and such definitive agreement may not ultimately be entered into on terms contemplated, if at all. In the event that we are unable to come to mutually agreeable definitive terms with Celltrion Healthcare, we will need to locate an alternative supplier of the anti-TNF biosimilar drug, and we may be unable to find an alternative supplier or such alternative supplier may require less favorable terms than are currently contemplated. Any of the above may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe expect to face intense competition from companies with greater resources and experience than we have; and may face competition from competitors seeking to market our products under a Section 505(b)(2) application.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change. The industry continues to expand and evolve as an increasing number of competitors and potential competitors enter the market. Many of these competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, managerial and research and development resources and experience than our company. Some of these competitors and potential competitors have more experience than our company in the development of pharmaceutical products, including validation procedures and regulatory matters. In addition, our future product candidates, if successfully developed, will compete with product offerings from large and well-established companies that have greater marketing and sales experience and capabilities than our company or our collaboration partners have. In particular, Insys Therapeutics, Inc. is developing CBD in Infantile Spasms (\u201cIS\u201d), and potentially other indications. Zogenix, Inc. has reported positive data in two Phase 3 trials of low dose fenfluramine in Dravet syndrome and has commenced a Phase 3 trial with this product in Lennox Gastaut Syndrome. Biocodex recently received regulatory approval from the FDA for the drug Stiripentol (Diacomit) for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. Other companies with greater resources than our company may announce similar plans in the future. In addition, there are non-FDA approved CBD preparations being made available from companies in the medical marijuana industry, which might attempt to compete with our future product candidates.\nAdditionally, competitors may also seek to market versions of our drug products via a section 505(b)(2) application, which is a type of somewhat abbreviated NDA. NDA Section 505(b)(2) applications may be submitted for drug products that represent a modification, such as a new indication or new dosage form, of a previously approved drug. Section 505(b)(2) applications may rely on the FDA\u2019s previous findings for the safety and effectiveness of the previously approved drug in addition to information obtained by the 505(b)(2) applicant to support the modification of the previously approved drug. Preparing Section 505(b)(2) applications may be less costly and time-consuming than preparing an NDA based entirely on new data and information. Section 505(b)(2) applications are subject to the same patent certification procedures as an ANDA.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully, our commercial opportunities will be reduced and our business, results of operations and financial conditions may be materially harmed.\nOur future product candidates, if approved, may be unable to achieve the expected market acceptance and, consequently, limit our ability to generate revenue from new products.\nEven when product development is successful and regulatory approval has been obtained, our ability to generate sufficient revenue depends on the acceptance of our products by physicians and patients. We cannot assure you that any of our future product candidates will achieve the expected level of market acceptance and revenue if and when they obtain the requisite regulatory approvals. The market acceptance of any product depends on a number of factors, including the indication statement, warnings required by regulatory authorities in the product label and new competing products. Market acceptance can also be influenced by continued demonstration of efficacy and safety in commercial use, physicians\u2019 willingness to prescribe the product, reimbursement from third-party payors such as government health care programs and private third-party payors, the price of the product, the nature of any post-approval risk management activities mandated by regulatory authorities, competition, and marketing and distribution support. Further, our U.S. distribution depends on the adequate performance of a reimbursement support hub and contracted specialty pharmacies in a closed-distribution network. An ineffective or inefficient U.S. distribution model at launch may lead to inability to fulfill demand, and consequently a loss of revenue. The success and acceptance of a product in one country may be negatively affected by its activities in another. If we fail to adapt our approach to clinical trials in the U.S. market to meet the needs of EMA or other European regulatory authorities, or to generate the health economics and outcomes research data needed to support pricing and reimbursement negotiations or decisions in Europe, we may have difficulties obtaining marketing authorization for our products from EMA/European Commission and may have difficulties obtaining pricing and reimbursement approval for our products at a national level. Any factors preventing or limiting the market acceptance of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAll of our patents in the Anti-TNF and Fibrosis program are method of use patents, which may result in biosimilar drugs being used without our permission.\nThe success of our most advanced drug development platform depends on the enforceability of our method of use patents, as there are currently many biosimilar anti-TNF drugs in the market. If we are unable to obtain composition of matter patents, and enforce such patents, our ability to generate revenue from the anti-TNF platform may be significantly limited and competitors may be able to use our research to bring competing drugs to market which would reduce our market share.\nThe majority of our license agreements provide the licensors and/or counter-parties the right to use and/or exploit such licensed intellectual property.\nThe majority of our license agreements provide the licensors and/or counter-parties the right to use and/or exploit such licensed intellectual property, and in some cases provide them ownership of such intellectual property, know-how and research results. As such, we may be in competition with parties who we have license agreements with, will likely not have the sole right to monetize, sell or distribute our product candidates and may be subject to restrictions on use and territory of sales. Any or all of the above may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and ultimately the value of our securities.\nInterim, topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials may change as more patient data become available, and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose preliminary, interim or topline data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change as patient enrollment and treatment continues and more patient data become available. For example, any positive results from our preclinical testing, Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of our product candidate for any product candidate may not necessarily be predictive of the results from planned or future clinical trials for such product candidates. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials after achieving positive results in pre-clinical and early clinical development, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, pre-clinical findings while clinical trials were underway or safety or efficacy observations in clinical trials, including adverse events. Adverse differences between previous preliminary or interim data and future interim or final data could significantly harm our business prospects. We may also announce topline data following the completion of a preclinical study or clinical trial, which may be subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the interim, topline or preliminary results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data has been received and fully evaluated. Preliminary, interim, or topline data also remains subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the data we previously published. As a result, preliminary, interim, and topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data is available.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product and our company in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine to be material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure. Moreover, our interpretation of clinical data or our conclusions based on the preclinical in vitro and in vivo models may prove inaccurate, as preclinical and clinical data can be susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials nonetheless failed to obtain FDA approval or a marketing authorization granted by the European Commission.\nIf we fail to produce positive results in our future clinical trials, the development timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects for such product candidates, and, correspondingly, our business and financial prospects, would be materially adversely affected.\nWe have limited marketing experience, and we may not be able to successfully commercialize any of our future product candidates, even if they are approved in the future.\nOur ability to generate revenues ultimately will depend on our ability to sell our approved products and secure adequate third-party reimbursement. We currently have no experience in marketing and selling our products. The commercial success of our future products depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the willingness of physicians to prescribe our future products to patients, payors\u2019 willingness and ability to pay for our future products, the level of pricing achieved, patients\u2019 response to our future products, and the ability of our future marketing partners to generate sales. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to establish or maintain the personnel, systems, arrangements and capabilities necessary to successfully commercialize our future products or any product candidate approved by the FDA or other regulatory authority in the future. If we fail to establish or maintain successful marketing, sales and reimbursement capabilities or fail to enter into successful marketing arrangements with third parties, our product revenues may suffer.\nIf the price for any of our future approved products decreases or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide coverage and adequate reimbursement levels, our revenue and prospects for profitability will suffer.\nPatients who are prescribed medicine for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region, and reimbursement approvals generally must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. Coverage and adequate reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Even if we obtain coverage for our future product candidates, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients may not use our future product candidates if coverage is not provided or reimbursement is inadequate to cover a significant portion of a patient\u2019s cost.\nIn addition, the market for our future product candidates in the U.S. will depend significantly on access to third-party payors\u2019 drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available.\nThird-party payors, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. The current environment is putting pressure on companies to price products below what they may feel is appropriate. Our future revenues and overall success could be negatively impacted if we sell future product candidates at less than an optimized price. In addition, in the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for our future product candidates may differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our future product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage will be obtained. If we are unable to obtain coverage of, and adequate payment levels for, our future product candidates, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them. This could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, and thereby adversely impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition and future success.\nIn addition, where we have chosen to collaborate with a third party on product candidate development and commercialization, our partner may elect to reduce the price of our products to increase the likelihood of obtaining reimbursement approvals. In many countries, products cannot be commercially launched until reimbursement is approved and the negotiation process in some countries can exceed 12 months. In addition, pricing and reimbursement decisions in certain countries can be affected by decisions made in other countries, which can lead to mandatory price reductions and/or additional reimbursement restrictions across a number of other countries, which may adversely affect sales and profitability. In the event that countries impose prices that are not sufficient to allow us or our partners to generate a profit, our partners may refuse to launch the product in such countries or withdraw the product from the market, which would adversely affect sales and profitability.\nBusiness interruptions could delay us in the process of developing our future product candidates and could disrupt our product sales.\nLoss of our future manufacturing facilities, stored inventory or laboratory facilities through fire, theft or other causes, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet demand for our future product candidates or to continue product development activities and to conduct our business. Failure to supply our partners with commercial products may lead to adverse consequences, including the right of partners to assume responsibility for product supply. Even if we obtain insurance coverage to compensate us for such business interruptions, such coverage may prove insufficient to fully compensate us for the damage to our business resulting from any significant property or casualty loss to our inventory.\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we will incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit the commercialization of our future product candidates.\nAlthough we have never had any product liability claims or lawsuits brought against us, we face potential product liability exposure related to the testing of our future product candidates in human clinical trials, and we will face exposure to claims in jurisdictions where we market and distribute in the future. We may face exposure to claims by an even greater number of persons when we begin marketing and distributing our products commercially in the U.S. and elsewhere. In the future, an individual may bring a liability claim against us alleging that one of our future product candidates caused an injury. While we continue to take what we believe are appropriate precautions, we may be unable to avoid significant liability if any product liability lawsuit is brought against us. Large judgments have been awarded in class action or individual lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. Although we have purchased insurance to cover product liability lawsuits, if we cannot successfully defend our company against product liability claims, or if such insurance coverage is inadequate, we will incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in decreased demand for our products, reputational damage, withdrawal of clinical trial participation participants, litigation costs, product recall costs, monetary awards, increased costs for liability insurance, lost revenues and business interruption.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and legal requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA, SEC or Office of Inspector General regulations, or regulations of any other applicable regulatory authority, failure to provide accurate information to the FDA or the SEC, comply with applicable manufacturing standards, other federal, state or foreign laws and regulations, report information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information, including information obtained in the course of clinical trials, or illegal appropriation of drug product, which could result in government investigations and serious harm to our reputation. Despite our adoption of a Code of Ethics, employee misconduct is not always possible to identify and deter. The precautions we take to detect and prevent these prohibited activities may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against our company, and we are not successful in defending our company or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, customs laws, sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, other remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries in which we do business. The FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit our company and our employees and intermediaries from bribing, being bribed or making other prohibited payments to government officials or other persons to obtain or retain business or gain some other business advantage. We and our commercial partners operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential FCPA violations, and we participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose actions could potentially subject us to liability under the FCPA or local anti-corruption laws. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the U.S., Canada, Israel, the United Kingdom and authorities in the EU, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions on countries and persons, customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, collectively referred to as the Trade Control Laws.\nHowever, there is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA or other legal requirements, including Trade Control Laws. If we are not in compliance with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control Laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws by the U.S. or other authorities could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business, prevent us from accessing critical information or expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we expect to collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected patient health information, credit card information, personally identifiable information about our employees, intellectual property, and proprietary business information. We expect to manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing on-site systems. These applications and data encompass a wide variety of business-critical information including research and development information, commercial information and business and financial information.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, or viruses, breaches or interruptions due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, or lapses in compliance with privacy and security mandates. Any such virus, breach or interruption could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. We have measures in place that are designed to prevent, and if necessary, to detect and respond to such security incidents and breaches of privacy and security mandates. However, in the future, any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as HIPAA and European Union General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), government enforcement actions and regulatory penalties. Unauthorized access, loss or dissemination could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to process samples, provide test results, share and monitor safety data, bill payors or patients, provide customer support services, conduct research and development activities, process and prepare company financial information, manage various general and administrative aspects of our business and may damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn May 2016, the EU formally adopted the GDPR, which applies to all EU member states and became effective on May 25, 2018 and replaced the European Union Data Protection Directive. The regulation introduces stringent new data protection requirements in the EU and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. It may increase our responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. The GDPR is a complex law and the regulatory guidance is still evolving, including with respect to how the GDPR should be applied in the context of clinical trials or other transactions from which we may gain access to personal data. GDPR increases our costs of compliance and results in greater legal risks.\nOur research and development programs and product candidates are in development. As a result, we are unable to predict if or when we will successfully develop or commercialize our product candidates.\nOur clinical-stage product candidates as well as our other drug pipeline candidates will require significant further investment and regulatory approvals prior to commercialization. Each of our product candidates will require the selection of suitable patients for our clinical trials and additional clinical development, management of clinical, preclinical and manufacturing activities, obtaining regulatory approval, obtaining manufacturing supply, building of a commercial organization, substantial investment and significant marketing efforts before we generate any revenues from product sales. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and we may never receive such regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. By such time, if ever, as we may receive necessary regulatory approvals for our product candidates, the standard of care for the treatment of diseases associated with our product candidates may have evolved such that it would be necessary to modify our plans for full approval and commercial acceptance of our products may be limited by a change in the standard of care.\nEven if we obtain the required financing or establish a collaboration to enable us to conduct late-stage clinical development of our product candidates and pipeline assets, we cannot be certain that such clinical development would be successful, or that we will obtain regulatory approval or be able to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates and generate revenue. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and the clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for their proposed uses. Any such failure could cause us to abandon further development of any one or more of our product candidates and may delay development of other product candidates. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay and possibly preclude the submission of any NDAs with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenue.\nWe have not previously submitted an NDA to the FDA, or similar drug approval filings to comparable foreign authorities, for any product candidate, and we cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will receive regulatory approval. Further, our product candidates may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical trials. If we do not receive regulatory approvals for our product candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approvals to market one or more of our product candidates, our revenues will be dependent, in part, upon our or our collaborators\u2019 and future collaborators\u2019 ability to obtain regulatory approval for the companion diagnostics to be used with our product candidates, if required, and upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval and have commercial rights. If the markets for patient subsets that we are targeting are not as significant as we estimate, we may not generate significant revenues from sales of such products, if approved.\nFurther, even if any product candidate we develop was to receive marketing approval or be commercialized for use in combination with other existing therapies, we would continue to bear the risks that the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities could revoke approval of the therapy used in combination with our product candidate or that safety, efficacy, manufacturing or supply issues could arise with these existing therapies.\nThe successful commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, will depend on achieving market acceptance and we may not be able to gain sufficient acceptance to generate significant revenue.\nEven if our product candidates are successfully developed and receive regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors such as private insurers or governments and other funding parties and the medical community. The degree of market acceptance for any of our products will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf demonstration of the clinical efficacy and safety of our products;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects;\n\u25cf limitations or warnings contained in the product\u2019s approved labeling;\n\u25cf cost-effectiveness and availability of acceptable pricing;\n\u25cf competitive product profile versus alternative treatment methods and the superiority of alternative treatment or therapeutics;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of marketing and distribution methods and support for the products; and\n\u25cf the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors to the extent that our products receive regulatory approval.\nDisease indications may be small subsets of a disease that could be parsed into smaller and smaller indications as different subsets of diseases are defined. This increasingly fine characterization of diseases could have negative consequences; including creating an approved indication that is so small as not to have a viable market for us. If future technology allows characterization of a disease in a way that is different from the characterization used for large pivotal studies, it may make those studies invalid or reduce their usefulness, and may require repeating all or a portion of the studies. Future technology may supply better prognostic ability which could reduce the portion of patients projected to need a new therapy. Even after being cleared by regulatory authorities, a product may later be shown to be unsafe or not to have its purported effect, thereby preventing its widespread use or requiring withdrawal from the market.\nWe may not be successful in establishing development and commercialization collaborations which could adversely affect, and potentially prohibit, our ability to develop our product candidates.\nDeveloping pharmaceutical products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approval, establishing manufacturing capabilities and marketing approved products is expensive, and therefore we may seek to enter into additional collaborations with companies that have more resources and experience in order to continue to develop and commercialize our product candidates. We also may be required due to financial or scientific constraints to enter into additional collaboration agreements to research and/or to develop and commercialize our product candidates. The establishment and realization of such collaborations may not be possible or may be problematic. There can be no assurance that we will be able to establish such additional collaborations on favorable terms, if at all, or that our current or future collaborative arrangements will be successful or maintained for any specific product candidate or indication. If we are unable to reach successful agreements with suitable collaboration partners for the ongoing development and commercialization of our product candidates, we may face increased costs, we may be forced to limit the scope and number of our product candidates we can commercially develop or the territories in which we commercialize such product candidates, and we may be unable to commercialize products or programs for which a suitable collaboration partner cannot be found. If we fail to achieve successful collaborations, our operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, the terms of any collaboration agreements may place restrictions on our activities with respect to other products, including by limiting our ability to grant licenses or develop products with other third parties, or in different indications, diseases or geographical locations, or may place additional obligations on us with respect to development or commercialization of our product candidates. If we fail to comply with or breach any provision of a collaboration agreement, a collaborator may have the right to terminate, in whole or in part, such agreement or to seek damages.\nSome of our collaboration and licensing agreements are complex and involve sharing or division of ownership of certain data, know-how and intellectual property rights among the various parties. Accordingly, our collaborators could interpret certain provisions differently than we or our other collaborators which could lead to unexpected or inadvertent disputes with collaborators. In addition, these agreements might make additional collaborations, partnering or mergers and acquisitions difficult.\nThere is no assurance that a collaborator who is acquired by a third party would not attempt to change certain contract provisions that could negatively affect our collaboration. The acquiring company may also not accept the terms or assignment of our contracts and may seek to terminate the agreements. Any one of our collaborators could breach covenants, restrictions and/or sub-license agreement provisions leading us into disputes and potential breaches of our agreements with other partners.\nWe will not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates without establishing sales and marketing capabilities internally or through collaborators.\nWe may not be able to find suitable sales and marketing staff and collaborators for all of our product candidates. The development of a marketing and sales capability will require significant expenditures, management resources and time. The cost of establishing such a sales force may exceed any potential product revenue, or our marketing and sales efforts may be unsuccessful. If we are unable to develop an internal marketing and sales capability in a timely fashion, or at all, or if we are unable to enter into a marketing and sales arrangement with a third party on acceptable terms, we may be unable to effectively market and sell approved products, if any, which would prevent us from being able to generate revenue and attain profitability. Further, we may not develop an internal marketing and sales capability if we are unable to successfully develop and seek regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nWe will rely upon third-party contractors and service providers for the execution of some aspects of our development programs. Failure of these collaborators to provide services of a suitable quality and within acceptable timeframes may cause the delay or failure of our development programs.\nWe outsource certain functions, tests and services to third parties, partners, medical institutions and collaborators and plan to outsource manufacturing to collaborators and/or contract manufacturers, and we will rely on third parties for quality assurance, clinical monitoring, clinical data management and regulatory expertise. In particular, we rely on our partners to run our clinical trials. There is no assurance that such individuals or organizations will be able to provide the functions, tests, drug supply or services as agreed upon or to acceptable quality standards, and we could suffer significant delays in the development of our products or processes. In particular, certain third party service providers may be unable to comply with their contractual obligations to us due to disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced operations or headcount reductions, or otherwise, and in certain cases we may have limited recourse if the non-compliance is due to factors outside of the service provider\u2019s control.\nThe timelines of our clinical trials may be impacted by numerous factors and any delays may adversely affect our ability to execute our current business strategy.\nClinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete, and is uncertain as to outcome. We may experience delays in clinical trials at any stage of development and testing of our product candidates. Our planned clinical trials may not begin on time, have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or be completed on schedule, if at all.\nEvents which may result in a delay or unsuccessful completion of clinical trials include:\n\u25cf inability to raise funding necessary to initiate or continue a trial;\n\u25cf delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u25cf delays in reaching agreement with the FDA on final trial design;\n\u25cf imposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf delays in obtaining required institutional review board approval at each site;\n\u25cf delays in having subjects complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u25cf delays caused by subjects dropping out of a trial due to side effects or otherwise;\n\u25cf clinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;\n\u25cf time required to add new clinical sites; and\n\u25cf delays by our contract manufacturers to produce and deliver a sufficient supply of clinical trial materials.\nIf initiation or completion of any of our clinical trials for our product candidates are delayed for any of the above reasons or for other reasons, our development costs may increase, our approval process could be delayed, any periods after commercial launch and before expiration of patent protection may be reduced and our competitors may have more time to bring products to market before we do. Any of these events could impair the commercial potential of our product candidates and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nClinical trials of our product candidates may not uncover all possible adverse effects that patients may experience.\nClinical trials are conducted in representative samples of the potential patient population, which may have significant variability. Clinical trials are by design based on a limited number of subjects and of limited duration for exposure to the product used to determine whether, on a potentially statistically significant basis, the planned safety and efficacy of any product candidate can be achieved. As with the results of any statistical sampling, we cannot be sure that all side effects of our product candidates may be uncovered, and it may be the case that only with a significantly larger number of patients exposed to the product candidate for a longer duration, that a more complete safety profile is identified. Further, even larger clinical trials may not identify rare serious adverse effects or the duration of such studies may not be sufficient to identify when those events may occur. Patients treated with our products, if approved, may experience adverse reactions and it is possible that the FDA or other regulatory authorities may ask for additional safety data as a condition of, or in connection with, our efforts to obtain approval of our product candidates. If safety problems occur or are identified after our product candidates reach the market, we may, or regulatory authorities may require us to amend the labeling of our products, recall our products or even withdraw approval for our products.\nFailure can occur at any stage of our drug development efforts.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, testing that could delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for, or commercializing our drug candidates, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf regulators or Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) may not authorize us to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u25cf conditions may be imposed upon us by the FDA regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials, or we may be required to resubmit our clinical trial protocols to IRBs for review due to changes in the regulatory environment;\n\u25cf the number of subjects required for our clinical trials may be larger, patient enrollment may take longer, or patients may drop out of our clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u25cf we may have to suspend or terminate one or more of our clinical trials if we, regulators, or IRBs determine that the participants are being subjected to unreasonable health risks;\n\u25cf our third-party contractors, clinical investigators or contractual collaborators may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or fail to meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner;\n\u25cf the FDA may not accept clinical data from trials that are conducted at clinical sites in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from the United States;\n\u25cf our tests may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional testing; and\n\u25cf the costs of our pre-clinical and/or clinical trials may be greater than we anticipate.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our pre-clinical studies and clinical studies and trials, and if they do not perform their obligations to us we may not be able to obtain approval for additional indications.\nWe do not currently have the ability to independently conduct pre-clinical studies or clinical studies and trials, and we have to date relied on third parties, such as third-party contract research and governmental organizations and medical institutions to conduct studies and trials for us. Our reliance on third parties for development activities reduces our control over these activities. These third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our pre-clinical studies and our clinical studies and trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our study design. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be adversely affected, and our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize indications may be delayed.\nIf we conduct studies with other parties, we may not have control over all decisions associated with that trial. To the extent that we disagree with the other party on such issues as study design, study timing and the like, it could adversely affect our drug development plans.\nAlthough we also rely on third parties to manage the data from our studies and trials, we are responsible for confirming that each of our studies and trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies will require us to comply with applicable regulations and standards, including Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP), for conducting, recording and reporting the results of such studies and trials to assure that the data and the results are credible and accurate and that the human study and trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third-parties does not relieve us of these obligations and requirements, and we may fail to obtain regulatory approval for any additional indications if these requirements are not met.\nWe will need to continue to develop and maintain distribution and production capabilities or relationships to be successful.\nWe may not be able to successfully manufacture any product, either independently or under manufacturing arrangements, if any, with third party manufacturers. Moreover, if any manufacturer should cease doing business with us or experience delays, shortages of supply or excessive demands on their capacity, we may not be able to obtain adequate quantities of product in a timely manner, or at all. Manufacturers, and in certain situations their suppliers, are required to comply with current NDA commitments and current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) requirements enforced by the FDA, and similar requirements of other countries. The failure by a manufacturer to comply with these requirements could affect its ability to provide us with products. Although we intend to rely on third-party contract manufacturers, we are ultimately responsible for ensuring that our products are manufactured in accordance with cGMP. In addition, if, during a preapproval inspection or other inspection of our third-party manufacturers\u2019 facility or facilities, the FDA determines that the facility is not in compliance with cGMP, any of our marketing applications that lists such facility as a manufacturer may not be approved or approval may be delayed until the facility comes into compliance with cGMP and completes a successful re-inspection by the FDA.\nAny manufacturing problem, natural disaster, or epidemic, affecting manufacturing facilities, or the loss of a contract manufacturer could be disruptive to our operations and result in lost sales. Additionally, we will be reliant on third parties to supply the raw materials needed to manufacture our products. Any reliance on suppliers may involve several risks, including a potential inability to obtain critical materials and reduced control over production costs, delivery schedules, reliability and quality. Any unanticipated disruption to future contract manufacture caused by problems at suppliers could delay shipment of products, increase our cost of goods sold and result in lost sales. If our suppliers were to be unable to supply us with adequate supply of our drugs, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to successfully commercialize our drug candidates.\nIf we rely on a sole source of supply to manufacture our products we could be impacted by the viability of our supplier.\nWe intend to attempt to source our products from more than one supplier. We also intend to enter into contracts with any supplier of our products to contractually obligate them to meet our requirements. However, if we are reliant on a single supplier and that supplier cannot or will not meet our requirements (for whatever reason), our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe may not be able to sufficiently scale-up manufacturing of our drug candidates.\nWe may not be able to successfully increase in a sufficient manner the manufacturing capacity for our drug candidates, whether in collaboration with third-party manufacturers or on our own, in a timely or cost-effective manner or at all. If a contract manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our drug candidates, we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to those improvements.\nSignificant scale-up of manufacturing may require additional validation studies, which are costly and which the FDA must review and approve. In addition, quality issues may arise during those scale-up activities because of the inherent properties of a drug candidate itself or of a drug candidate in combination with other components added during the manufacturing and packaging process, or during shipping and storage of the finished product or active pharmaceutical ingredients. If we are unable to successfully scale-up manufacture of any of our drug candidates in sufficient quality and quantity, the development of that drug candidate and regulatory approval or commercial launch for any resulting drug products may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply, which could significantly harm our business.\nRisks Related to Development and Regulatory Approval of our Future Product Candidates\nClinical trials are expensive, time-consuming, uncertain and susceptible to change, delay or termination. The results of clinical trials are open to differing interpretations.\nWe have three separate programs for producing anti-inflammatory agents: (1) investigating new clinical opportunities for anti-TNF, (2) identifying orally available, small molecules that are agonists of \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, and (3) identifying patentable analogs of CBD that initially will be used as pain medications. However, these programs, including the related clinical trials, are expensive, time consuming and difficult to design and implement.\nRegulatory agencies may analyze or interpret the results of clinical trials differently than us. Even if the results of our clinical trials are favorable, the clinical trials for a number of its future product candidates are expected to continue for several years and may take significantly longer to complete. In addition, the FDA or other regulatory authorities, including state, local and foreign authorities, or an IRB, with respect to a trial at our institution, may suspend, delay or terminate its clinical trials at any time, require us to conduct additional clinical trials, require a particular clinical trial to continue for a longer duration than originally planned, require a change to its development plans such that we conduct clinical trials for a product candidate in a different order, e.g., in a step-wise fashion rather than running two trials of the same product candidate in parallel, or could suspend or terminate the registrations and quota allotments we require in order to procure and handle controlled substances, for various reasons, including the following, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u25cf lack of effectiveness of any product candidate during clinical trials;\n\u25cf discovery of serious or unexpected toxicities or side effects experienced by trial participants or other safety issues, such as drug interactions, including those which cause confounding changes to the levels of other concomitant medications;\n\u25cf slower than expected rates of subject recruitment and enrollment rates in clinical trials;\n\u25cf difficulty in retaining subjects who have initiated a clinical trial but may withdraw at any time due to adverse side effects from the therapy, insufficient efficacy, fatigue with the clinical trial process or for any other reason;\n\u25cf delays or inability in manufacturing or obtaining sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials due to regulatory and manufacturing constraints;\n\u25cf inadequacy of or changes in our manufacturing process or product formulation;\n\u25cf delays in obtaining regulatory authorization to commence a trial, including \u201cclinical holds\u201d or delays requiring suspension or termination of a trial by a regulatory agency, such as the FDA, before or after a trial is commenced;\n\u25cf DEA related recordkeeping, reporting security or other violations at a clinical site, leading the DEA or state authorities to suspend or revoke the site\u2019s-controlled substance license and causing a delay or termination of planned or ongoing trials;\n\u25cf changes in applicable regulatory policies and regulation, including changes to requirements imposed on the extent, nature or timing of studies;\n\u25cf delays or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms in clinical trial contracts or protocols with prospective clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf uncertainty regarding proper dosing;\n\u25cf delay or failure to supply product for use in clinical trials which conforms to regulatory specification;\n\u25cf unfavorable results from ongoing pre-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u25cf failure of our contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d), or other third-party contractors to comply with all contractual requirements or to perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner;\n\u25cf failure by our company, our employees, our CROs or their employees to comply with all applicable FDA or other regulatory requirements relating to the conduct of clinical trials;\n\u25cf scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions;\n\u25cf failure to design appropriate clinical trial protocols;\n\u25cf regulatory concerns with CBD derivative products generally and the potential for abuse, despite only working with non-plant based non-psychoactive products;\n\u25cf insufficient data to support regulatory approval;\n\u25cf inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols; or\n\u25cf difficulty in maintaining contact with patients during or after treatment, which may result in incomplete data.\nWe may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials, which could delay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates.\nIdentifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends on the speed at which we can recruit eligible patients to participate in testing our product candidates. We have experienced delays in some of our clinical trials, and we may experience similar delays in the future. These delays could result in increased costs, delays in advancing our product development, or termination of the clinical trials altogether.\nWe may not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with required or desired characteristics to achieve diversity in a study, to complete our clinical trials within the expected timeframe. Patient enrollment can be impacted by factors including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf design and complexity and/or commitment of participation required in the study protocol;\n\u25cf size of the patient population;\n\u25cf eligibility criteria for the study in question;\n\u25cf clinical supply availability;\n\u25cf delays in participating site identification, qualification and subsequent activation to enroll;\n\u25cf perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study, including as a result of adverse effects observed in similar or competing therapies;\n\u25cf proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n\u25cf availability of competing therapies and clinical trials;\n\u25cf competition of site efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u25cf participating site motivation;\n\u25cf patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u25cf activities of patient advocacy groups;\n\u25cf ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and\n\u25cf severity of the disease under investigation.\nIn particular, each of the conditions for which we plan to evaluate our product candidates are diseases with limited patient pools from which to draw for clinical trials. The eligibility criteria of our clinical trials will further limit the pool of available study participants. Additionally, the process of finding and diagnosing patients may prove costly. The treating physicians in our clinical trials may also use their medical discretion in advising patients enrolled in our clinical trials to withdraw from our studies to try alternative therapies. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may impact patient ability and willingness to travel to clinical trial sites as a result of quarantines and other restrictions, which may negatively impact enrollment in our clinical trials.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we cannot enroll the required eligible patients per protocol to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA or the EMA or other regulatory agencies. Our ability to successfully initiate, enroll and complete a clinical trial in any foreign country is subject to numerous risks unique to conducting business in foreign countries, including:\n\u25cf difficulty in establishing or managing relationships with contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and physicians;\n\u25cf different standards for the conduct of clinical trials;\n\u25cf our inability to locate qualified local consultants, physicians and partners;\n\u25cf the potential burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws, medical standards and regulatory requirements, including the regulation of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and treatment;\n\u25cf ability to procure and deliver necessary clinical trial materials needed to perform the study; and\n\u25cf inability to implement adequate training at participating sites remotely when in person training cannot be completed.\nIf we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay, limit or terminate ongoing or planned clinical trials, any of which would have an adverse effect on our ability to complete clinical trials and ultimately our results of operations.\nAny failure by our company to comply with existing regulations could harm our reputation and operating results.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. federal and state and foreign governments in each of the U.S., European and Canadian markets, in which we plan to sell our products, or in markets where we have product candidates progressing through the approval process.\nWe must adhere to all regulatory requirements including FDA\u2019s Good Laboratory Practice (\u201cGLP\u201d), Good Clinical Practice (\u201cGCP\u201d), and GMP requirements, pharmacovigilance requirements, advertising and promotion restrictions, reporting and recordkeeping requirements, and their European equivalents. If we or our suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulations, including FDA pre-or post-approval requirements, then the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities could sanction our company. Even if a drug is approved by the FDA or other competent authorities, regulatory authorities may impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-marketing trials. Any of product candidates which may be approved in the U.S. will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, import, export, advertising, promotion, sampling, recordkeeping and submission of safety and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements. In addition, manufacturers and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to GMP. As such, we and our contract manufacturers (in the event contract manufacturers are appointed in the future) are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with GMP. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work will have to spend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, quality control and quality assurance. We will also be required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for its products. Promotional communications with respect to prescription drugs are subject to a variety of legal and regulatory restrictions and must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved label. Similar restrictions and requirements exist in the EU and other markets where we operate.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of the product, it may impose restrictions on that product or on our company, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may issue warning letters, impose civil or criminal penalties, suspend regulatory approval, suspend any of our ongoing clinical trials, refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us, impose restrictions on our operations, or seize or detain products or require a product recall.\nIn addition, it is possible that our future products will be regulated by the DEA, under the Controlled Substances Act or under similar laws elsewhere. DEA scheduling is a separate process that can delay when a drug may become available to patients beyond an NDA approval date, and the timing and outcome of such DEA process is uncertain. See also \u201cRisks Related to Controlled Substances.\u201d\nIn addition, any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to spend significant time and resources in response, and could generate negative publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from our future product candidates. If regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is withdrawn, the value of our business and our operating results may be adversely affected.\nAny action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation. We expect to spend significant resources on compliance efforts and such expenses are unpredictable. Changing laws, regulations and standards might also create uncertainty, higher expenses and increase insurance costs. As a result, we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards, and this investment might result in increased management and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations and implementation of or changes to such healthcare laws and regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our future product candidates. If we are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other federal, state or foreign regulations, we may be subject to administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, we from federal health care programs and the restructuring of our operations. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. Since many of these laws have not been fully interpreted by the courts, there is an increased risk that we may be found in violation of one or more of their provisions. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we ultimately are successful in our defense, will cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention away from the operation of our business. In addition, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the EU the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control.\nIn some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country.\nFor example, some EU jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. Such differences in national pricing regimes may create price differentials between EU member states. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the U.K. and EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. In the U.K. and EU, the downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, has become intense. As a result, barriers to entry of new products are becoming increasingly high and patients are unlikely to use a drug product that is not reimbursed by their government. We may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, the importation of foreign products may compete with any future product that we may market, which could negatively impact our profitability.\nSpecifically, in the U.S., we expect that the 2010 Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d), as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we may receive for any approved product. There have been judicial challenges to certain aspects of the ACA and numerous legislative attempts to repeal and/or replace the ACA in whole or in part, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. At this time, the full effect that the ACA will have on our business in the future remains unclear. An expansion in the government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may cause general downward pressure on the prices of prescription drug products, lower reimbursements or any other product for which we obtain regulatory approval, reduce product utilization and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize any of our future product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval.\nInformation obtained from expanded access studies may not reliably predict the efficacy of our future product candidates in company-sponsored clinical trials and may lead to adverse events that could limit approval.\nThe expanded access studies we are currently supporting are uncontrolled, carried out by individual investigators and not typically conducted in strict compliance with GCPs, all of which can lead to a treatment effect which may differ from that in placebo-controlled trials. These studies provide only anecdotal evidence of efficacy for regulatory review. These studies contain no control or comparator group for reference and this patient data is not designed to be aggregated or reported as study results. Moreover, data from such small numbers of patients may be highly variable. Information obtained from these studies, including the statistical principles that we and the independent investigators have chosen to apply to the data, may not reliably predict data collected via systematic evaluation of the efficacy in company-sponsored clinical trials or evaluated via other statistical principles that may be applied in those trials. Reliance on such information to design our clinical trials may lead to trials that are not adequately designed to demonstrate efficacy and could delay or prevent our ability to seek approval of our future product candidates.\nExpanded access programs provide supportive safety information for regulatory review. Physicians conducting these studies may use our future product candidates in a manner inconsistent with the protocol, including in children with conditions beyond those being studied in trials which we sponsor. Any adverse events or reactions experienced by subjects in the expanded access program may be attributed to our future product candidates and may limit our ability to obtain regulatory approval with labeling that we consider desirable, or at all.\nThere is a high rate of failure for drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials.\nGenerally, there is a high rate of failure for drug candidates proceeding through clinical trials. We may suffer significant setbacks in our clinical trials similar to the experience of a number of other companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, even after receiving promising results in earlier trials. Further, even if we view the results of a clinical trial to be positive, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of the data. In the event that we obtain negative results from clinical trials for product candidates or other problems related to potential chemistry, manufacturing and control issues or other hurdles occur and our future product candidates are not approved, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue or obtain financing to continue our operations, our ability to execute on our current business plan may be materially impaired, and our reputation in the industry and in the investment community might be significantly damaged. In addition, our inability to properly design, commence and complete clinical trials may negatively impact the timing and results of our clinical trials and ability to seek approvals for our drug candidates.\nIf we are found in violation of federal or state \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws or similar laws in other jurisdictions, we may be required to pay a penalty and/or be suspended from participation in federal or state health care programs, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the U.S., we are subject to various federal and state health care \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws and other laws intended to reduce fraud and abuse in federal and state health care programs, which could affect our company particularly upon successful commercialization of our products in the U.S. The Medicare and Medicaid Patient Protection Act of 1987, or federal Anti-Kickback Statute, makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order or prescription of a particular drug for which payment may be made under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Under federal law, some arrangements, known as safe harbors, are deemed not to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although we seek to structure our business arrangements in compliance with all applicable requirements, it is often difficult to determine precisely how the law will be applied in specific circumstances. Accordingly, it is possible that our practices may be challenged under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and Federal False Claims Act. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state health care programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states.\nWhile we believe that we have structured our business arrangements to comply with these laws, the government could allege violations of, or convict us of violating, these laws. If we are found in violation of one of these laws, we could be required to pay a penalty and could be suspended or excluded from participation in federal or state health care programs, and our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe Member States of the EU and other countries also have anti-kickback laws and can impose penalties in case of infringement, which, in some jurisdictions, can also be enforced by competitors.\nSerious adverse events or other safety risks could require us to abandon development and preclude, delay or limit approval of our future product candidates, limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance, or cause the recall or loss of marketing approval of products that are already marketed.\nIf any of our future product candidates prior to or after any approval for commercial sale, cause serious or unexpected side effects, or are associated with other safety risks such as misuse, abuse or diversion, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may deny regulatory approval of our future product candidates;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require certain labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications or limitations on the indications for use, and/or impose restrictions on distribution in the form of a REMS in connection with approval or post-approval;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval, require more onerous labeling statements, impose more restrictive REMS, or require us to recall any product that is approved;\n\u25cf we may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u25cf our relationships with our collaboration partners may suffer;\n\u25cf we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; or\n\u25cf our reputation may suffer. The reputational risk is heightened with respect to those of our future product candidates that are being developed for pediatric indications.\nWe may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that the products present an unacceptable risk to participants, or if preliminary data demonstrates that our future product candidates are unlikely to receive regulatory approval or unlikely to be successfully commercialized. Following receipt of approval for commercial sale of a product, we may voluntarily withdraw or recall that product from the market if at any time we believe that its use, or a person\u2019s exposure to it, may cause adverse health consequences or death. To date, we have not withdrawn, recalled or taken any other action, voluntary or mandatory, to remove an approved product from the market. In addition, regulatory agencies, IRBs or data safety monitoring boards may at any time recommend the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials or request that we cease using investigators in the clinical trials if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. Although we have never been asked by a regulatory agency, IRB or data safety monitoring board to temporarily or permanently discontinue a clinical trial, if we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate a clinical trial of any of our future product candidates, the commercial prospects for that product will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue from that product may be delayed or eliminated. Furthermore, any of these events may result in labeling statements such as warnings or contraindications. In addition, such events or labeling could prevent us or our partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our future product candidates and impair our ability to generate revenue from the commercialization of these products either by our company or by our collaboration partners.\nThe development of REMS for our future product candidates could cause delays in the approval process and would add additional layers of regulatory requirements that could impact our ability to commercialize our future product candidates in the U.S. and reduce their market potential.\nEven if the FDA approves our NDA for any of our future product candidates without requiring a REMS as a condition of approval of the NDA, the FDA may, post-approval, require a REMS for any of our future product candidates if it becomes aware of new safety information that makes a REMS necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS elements can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe use (\u201cETASU\u201d). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug\u2019s safety or efficacy. We may be required to adopt a REMS for our future product candidates to ensure that the benefits outweigh the risks of abuse, misuse, diversion and other potential safety concerns. There can be no assurance that the FDA will approve a manageable REMS for our future product candidates, which could create material and significant limits on our ability to successfully commercialize our future product candidates in the U.S. Delays in the REMS approval process could result in delays in the NDA approval process. In addition, as part of the REMS, the FDA could require significant restrictions, such as restrictions on the prescription, distribution and patient use of the product, which could significantly impact our ability to effectively commercialize our future product candidates, and dramatically reduce their market potential, thereby adversely impacting our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if initial REMS are not highly restrictive, if, after launch, our future product candidates were to be subject to significant abuse/non-medical use or diversion from illicit channels, this could lead to negative regulatory consequences, including a more restrictive REMS.\nRisks Related to our Reliance Upon Third Parties\nOur existing collaboration arrangements and any that we may enter into in the future may not be successful, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our future product candidates.\nWe are a party to, and may seek additional, collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the development or commercialization of our future product candidates. We may, with respect to our future product candidates, enter into new arrangements on a selective basis depending on the merits of retaining commercialization rights for ourselves as compared to entering into selective collaboration arrangements with leading pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for each product candidate, both in the U.S. and internationally. To the extent that we decide to enter into collaboration agreements, we will face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators and the terms of any collaboration or other arrangements that we may establish may not be favorable to us.\nAny existing or future collaboration that we enter into may not be successful. The success of our collaboration arrangements will depend heavily on the efforts and activities of our collaborators. Collaborators generally have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations. Disagreements between parties to a collaboration arrangement regarding development, intellectual property, regulatory or commercialization matters, can lead to delays in the development process or commercialization of the applicable product candidate and, in some cases, termination of the collaboration arrangement. These disagreements can be difficult to resolve if neither of the parties has final decision-making authority. Any such termination or expiration could harm our business reputation and may adversely affect it financially.\nWe expect to depend on a limited number of suppliers for materials and components in order to manufacture our future product candidates. The loss of these suppliers, or their failure to supply us on a timely basis, could cause delays in our current and future capacity and adversely affect our business.\nWe expect to depend on a limited number of suppliers for the materials and components required to manufacture our future product candidates. As a result, we may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of critical materials and components in the future. A delay or interruption by our suppliers may also harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new supplier can be lengthy, and we may experience delays in meeting demand in the event we must switch to a new supplier. The time and effort to qualify for and, in some cases, obtain regulatory approval for a new supplier could result in additional costs, diversion of resources or reduced manufacturing yields, any of which would negatively impact our operating results. Our dependence on single-source suppliers exposes us to numerous risks, including the following: our suppliers may cease or reduce production or deliveries, they may be subject to government investigations and regulatory actions that limit or prevent production capabilities for an extended period of time, raise prices or renegotiate terms; our suppliers may become insolvent; we may be unable to locate a suitable replacement supplier on acceptable terms or on a timely basis, or at all; and delays caused by supply issues may harm our reputation, frustrate our customers and cause them to turn to our competitors for future needs.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our future product candidates or our proprietary technology in the marketplace.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, protect our trade secrets and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection (i.e., know-how), and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property of our future product candidates. The strengths of patents in the pharmaceutical field involve complex legal and scientific questions, and can be uncertain. Where appropriate, we seek patent protection for certain aspects of our products and technology. Filing, prosecuting and defending patents globally can be prohibitively expensive.\nOur policy is to look to patent technologies with commercial potential in jurisdictions with significant commercial opportunities. However, patent protection may not be available for some of the products or technology we are developing. If we must spend significant time and money protecting, defending or enforcing our patents, designing around patents held by others or licensing, potentially for large fees, patents or other proprietary rights held by others, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed. We may not develop additional proprietary products that are patentable. As of the date hereof, we have an extensive portfolio of patents, including many granted patents and patents pending approval.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical products are complex and uncertain. The scope and extent of patent protection for our future product candidates are particularly uncertain. Our future product candidates will be based on medicinal chemistry instead of cannabis plants. While we have sought patent protection, where appropriate, directed to, among other things, composition-of-matter for its specific formulations, their methods of use, and methods of manufacture, we do not have and will not be able to obtain composition of matter protection on these previously known CBD derivatives per se. We anticipate that the products we develop in the future will be based upon synthetic compounds we may discover. Although we have sought, and will continue to seek, patent protection in the U.S., Europe and other countries for our proprietary technologies, future product candidates, their methods of use, and methods of manufacture, any or all of them may not be subject to effective patent protection. If any of our products are approved and marketed for an indication for which we do not have an issued patent, our ability to use our patents to prevent a competitor from commercializing a non-branded version of our commercial products for that non-patented indication could be significantly impaired or even eliminated.\nPublication of information related to our future product candidates by our company or others may prevent it from obtaining or enforcing patents relating to these products and product candidates. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar products, may duplicate our products, or may design around our patent rights. In addition, any of our issued patents may be opposed and/or declared invalid or unenforceable. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, we may face competition from companies who attempt to create a generic product to compete with our future product candidates. We may also face competition from companies who develop a substantially similar product to our future product candidates that is not covered by any of our patents.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting, defending and enforcing intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property rights, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nIf third parties claim that intellectual property used by our company infringes upon their intellectual property, our operating profits could be adversely affected.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the U.S., involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industry. We may, from time to time, be notified of claims that we are infringing upon patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties, and we cannot provide assurances that other companies will not, in the future, pursue such infringement claims against us, our commercial partners or any third-party proprietary technologies we have licensed. If we were found to infringe upon a patent or other intellectual property right, or if we failed to obtain or renew a license under a patent or other intellectual property right from a third party, or if a third party from whom we were licensing technologies was found to infringe upon a patent or other intellectual property rights of another third party, we may be required to pay damages, including damages of up to three times the damages found or assessed, if the infringement is found to be willful, suspend the manufacture of certain products or reengineer or rebrand our products, if feasible, or we may be unable to enter certain new product markets. Any such claims could also be expensive and time consuming to defend and divert management\u2019s attention and resources. Our competitive position could suffer as a result. In addition, if we have declined or failed to enter into a valid non-disclosure or assignment agreement for any reason, we may not own the invention or its intellectual property, and our products may not be adequately protected. Thus, we cannot guarantee that any of our future product candidates, or our commercialization thereof, does not and will not infringe any third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nIf we are not able to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information, the value of our technology and products could be significantly diminished.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technologies, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with current and former employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, contract manufacturers, vendors and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we have executed these agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets. Any party with whom we or they have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches.\nEnforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Also, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they disclose such trade secrets, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor or other third-party, our competitive position would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Controlled Substances\nControlled substance legislation differs between countries, and legislation in certain countries may restrict or limit our ability to sell our future product candidates.\nMost countries are parties to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961 and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances 1971, which governs international trade and domestic control of narcotic substances, including cannabis extracts. Countries may interpret and implement their treaty obligations in a way that creates a legal obstacle to us obtaining marketing approval for our future products in those countries. These countries may not be willing or able to amend or otherwise modify their laws and regulations to permit our future products to be marketed, or achieving such amendments to the laws and regulations may take a prolonged period of time. In that case, we would be unable to market our future product candidates in those countries in the near future or perhaps at all.\nThe product candidates that we are developing may be subject to U.S. controlled substance laws and regulations and failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations, may adversely affect the results of our business operations, both during clinical development and post approval, and our financial condition.\nThe product candidates that we are developing may contain controlled substances as defined in The United States Federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 and the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, as amended (\u201cCSA\u201d). Controlled substances that are pharmaceutical products are subject to a high degree of regulation under the CSA, which establishes, among other things, certain registration, manufacturing quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA classifies controlled substances into five schedules: Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, no currently \u201caccepted medical use\u201d in the U.S., lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be prescribed, marketed or sold in the U.S. Pharmaceutical products approved for use in the U.S. which contain a controlled substance are listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest potential for abuse or dependence and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances.\nWhile cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance, products approved for medical use in the U.S. that contain cannabis or cannabis extracts should be placed in Schedules II-V, since approval by the FDA satisfies the \u201caccepted medical use\u201d requirement. If and when any of our future product candidates receive FDA approval, the DEA will make a scheduling determination. If the FDA, the DEA or any foreign regulatory authority determines that our future product candidates may have potential for abuse, it may require us to generate more clinical or other data than we currently anticipate to establish whether or to what extent the substance has an abuse potential, which could increase the cost and/or delay the launch of that product.\nFacilities conducting research, manufacturing, distributing, importing or exporting, or dispensing controlled substances must be registered (licensed) to perform these activities and have the security, control, recordkeeping, reporting and inventory mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent drug loss and diversion. All these facilities must renew their registrations annually, except dispensing facilities, which must renew every three years. The DEA conducts periodic inspections of certain registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Obtaining the necessary registrations may result in delay of the importation, manufacturing or distribution of our future products. Furthermore, failure to maintain compliance with the CSA, particularly non-compliance resulting in loss or diversion, can result in regulatory action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to restrict, suspend or revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings.\nIndividual states have also established controlled substance laws and regulations. Although state-controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule our future product candidates as well. State scheduling may delay commercial sale of any product for which we obtain federal regulatory approval and adverse scheduling could have a material adverse effect on the commercial attractiveness of such product. We or our partners must also obtain separate state registrations, permits or licenses in order to be able to obtain, handle, and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions by the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law.\nBecause our products may be controlled substances in the U.S., to conduct clinical trials in the U.S., each of our research sites must submit a research protocol to the DEA and obtain and maintain a DEA researcher registration that will allow those sites to handle and dispense our products and to obtain product from our importer. If the DEA delays or denies the grant of a research registration to one or more research sites, the clinical trial could be significantly delayed, and we could lose clinical trial sites. The importer for the clinical trials must also obtain an importer registration and an import permit for each import.\nThe legislation on cannabis in the EU differs among the member states, as this area is not yet fully harmonized. In Germany, for example, cannabis is regulated as a controlled substance (Bet\u00e4ubungsmittel) and its handling requires specific authorization.\nThe legalization and use of medical and recreational cannabis in the U.S. and abroad may impact our business.\nThere is a substantial amount of change occurring in the U.S. regarding the use of medical and recreational cannabis products. While cannabis products not approved by the FDA are Schedule I substances as defined under federal law, and their possession and use is not permitted according to federal law (except for research purposes, under DEA registration), at least 36 states and the District of Columbia have enacted state laws to enable possession and use of cannabis for medical purposes, and at least 18 states and the District of Columbia for recreational purposes. The U.S. Farm Bill, which was passed in 2018, descheduled certain material derived from hemp plants with extremely low tetrahydrocannabinol (\u201cTHC\u201d) content. Although our business is quite distinct from that of online and dispensary cannabis companies, future legislation authorizing the sale, distribution, use, and insurance reimbursement of non-FDA approved cannabis products could affect our business.\nGeneral Business Risks Relating to our Company\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and rules enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC, NASDAQ and other legal or regulatory requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws, regulations and rules may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws, regulations and rules and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCertain of our executive officers and directors are now, and all of them may in the future become, affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those conducted by us and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\nOur executive officers and directors are, or may in the future become, affiliated with entities that are engaged in business activities similar to those that are conducted by us. Our officers and directors also may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us and the other entities to which they owe certain fiduciary or contractual duties. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business opportunity should be presented to our company or to another entity. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential opportunity may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us. Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.\nOur executive officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests.\nWe have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, executive officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. In fact, we may enter into a strategic transaction with a target business that is affiliated with our directors or executive officers. Nor do we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours. Certain of our officers and directors hold positions with companies which may be competitors of us. See also the biographies of our officers and directors incorporated by reference herein below under \u201cDirectors, Officers and Corporate Governance\u201d.\nThe value of our existing intangible assets may become impaired, depending upon future operating results.\nOur intangible assets were approximately $51.5 million as of December 31, 2021, representing approximately 81% of our total assets. We evaluate our intangible assets annually, or more often if there is a triggering event, to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying value may no longer be recoverable, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment charge for intangible assets would adversely affect future reported results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity, although such charges would not affect our cash flow.\nOur outstanding warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nIn our IPO, we issued warrants to purchase 5,750,000 shares of common stock as part of the units offered in our IPO and, simultaneously with the closing of our IPO, we issued in a private placement an aggregate of 502,500 private placement warrants contained in the private placement units, each exercisable to purchase one-half of one share of common stock at $5.75 per half share. Additionally, (a) in February 2021, we sold warrants to purchase up to 2,564,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $5.00 per share, (b) in May 2021, we issued warrants to purchase up to 63,658 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $5.28 per share, (c) we issued certain warrants to purchase up to 25,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $7.07 per share in July 2021, and (d) in August 2021, we sold warrants to purchase up to 2,500,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $7.50 per share. Such warrants, if and when exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and potentially reduce the value of the outstanding shares of common stock.\nOur business has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. In January 2020, COVID-19 spread to other parts of the word, including the United States and Europe, and efforts to contain its spread have intensified, with varying degrees of success. As a result, businesses have closed and limits have been placed on travel and everyday activities. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions, and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease. Should the COVID-19 pandemic continue, our plans could be delayed or interrupted. The spread of COVID-19 has also created global economic uncertainty, which may cause partners, suppliers and potential customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budget. The foregoing could materially adversely affect the clinical trials, supply chain, financial condition and financial performance of our company.\nEnrollment of patients in our clinical trials, maintaining patients in our ongoing clinical trials, doing follow up visits with recruited patients and collecting data have been, and may continue to be, delayed or limited as certain of our clinical trial sites limit their onsite staff or temporarily close as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing government restrictions. In addition, patients may not be able or willing to visit clinical trial sites for dosing or data collection purposes due to limitations on travel and physical distancing imposed or recommended by federal or state governments or patients\u2019 reluctance to visit the clinical trial sites during the pandemic. These factors resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could delay or prevent the anticipated readouts from our clinical trials, which could ultimately delay or prevent our ability to generate revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock and Warrants\nThe market price of our common stock has been extremely volatile and may continue to be volatile due to numerous circumstances beyond our control.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, widely, due to many factors, some of which may be beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation:\n\u25cf \u201cshort squeezes\u201d;\n\u25cf comments by securities analysts or other third parties, including blogs, articles, message boards and social and other media;\n\u25cf large stockholders exiting their position in our securities or an increase or decrease in the short interest in our securities;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial and operating results;\n\u25cf risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf the commencement, enrollment or results of our planned or future clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf the success of competitive drugs or therapies;\n\u25cf regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u25cf the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf the level of expenses related to our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u25cf the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates;\n\u25cf \u202factual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf our inability to obtain or delays in obtaining adequate drug supply for any approved drug or inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u25cf disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u25cf significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u25cf variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems, including coverage and adequate reimbursement for any approved drug;\n\u25cf market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;\n\u25cf general economic, political, and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the financial markets in the United States and abroad; and\n\u25cf investors\u2019 general perception of us and our business.\nStock markets in general and our stock price in particular have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies and our company. For example, on March 26, 2021, our common stock experienced an intra-day trading high of $10.60 per share and a low of $6.72 per share. In addition, during 2021, the sale prices of our common stock has ranged from a high of $13.05 per share (on April 13, 2021) to a low of $2.41 per share (on January 4, 2021). During this time, we have not experienced any material changes in our financial condition or results of operations that would explain such price volatility or trading volume. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our securities. Additionally, these and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent our stockholders from readily selling their shares of our common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock.\nInformation available in public media that is published by third parties, including blogs, articles, message boards and social and other media may include statements not attributable to the Company and may not be reliable or accurate.\nWe are aware of a large volume of information being disseminated by third parties relating to our operations, including in blogs, message boards and social and other media. Such information as reported by third parties may not be accurate, may lead to significant volatility in our securities and may ultimately result in our common stock or other securities declining in value.\nA significant number of our shares are eligible for sale and their sale or potential sale may depress the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock. Most of our common stock is available for resale in the public market, including (a) options to purchase 2,741,000 shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $4.77 per share; and (b) warrants to purchase 11,153,908 shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $9.06 per share. If a significant number of shares were sold, such sales would increase the supply of our common stock, thereby potentially causing a decrease in its price. Some or all of our shares of common stock may be offered from time to time in the open market pursuant to effective registration statements and/or compliance with Rule 144 (which was available starting November 6, 2021, subject to compliance with Rule 144, due to our status as a former \u201cshell company\u201d), which sales could have a depressive effect on the market for our shares of common stock. Subject to certain restrictions, a person who has held restricted shares for a period of six months may generally sell common stock into the market. The sale of a significant portion of such shares when such shares are eligible for public sale may cause the value of our common stock to decline in value.\nThere may not be sufficient liquidity in the market for our securities in order for investors to sell their shares. The market price of our common stock may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock will likely continue to be highly volatile. Some of the factors that may materially affect the market price of our common stock are beyond our control, such as conditions or trends in the industry in which we operate or sales of our common stock. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company which is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned and viable.\nAs a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a mature issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. It is possible that a broader or more active public trading market for our common stock will not develop or be sustained, or that trading levels will not continue. These factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our performance. In addition, the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Associated with Our Governing Documents and Delaware Law\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides for indemnification of officers and directors at our expense and limits their liability, which may result in a major cost to us and hurt the interests of our stockholders because corporate resources may be expended for the benefit of officers or directors.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation provides for indemnification as follows: \u201cTo the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Corporation is authorized to provide indemnification of, and advancement of expenses to, such agents of the Corporation (and any other persons to which Delaware law permits the Corporation to provide indemnification) through Bylaw provisions, agreements with such agents or other persons, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, in excess of the indemnification and advancement otherwise permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, subject only to limits created by applicable Delaware law (statutory or non-statutory), with respect to actions for breach of duty to the Corporation, its stockholders and others.\u201d\nWe have been advised that, in the opinion of the SEC, indemnification for liabilities arising under federal securities laws is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification for liabilities arising under federal securities laws, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by a director, officer or controlling person in connection with our activities, we will (unless in the opinion of our counsel, the matter has been settled by controlling precedent) submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction, the question whether indemnification by us is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. The legal process relating to this matter if it were to occur is likely to be very costly and may result in us receiving negative publicity, either of which factors is likely to materially reduce the market and price for our shares.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation contains a specific provision that limits the liability of our directors for monetary damages to the Company and the Company\u2019s stockholders and requires us, under certain circumstances, to indemnify officers, directors and employees.\nThe limitation of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under Delaware law and the existence of indemnification rights to them may result in substantial expenditures by us and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation contains a specific provision that limits the liability of our directors for monetary damages to the Company and the Company\u2019s stockholders. We also have contractual indemnification obligations under our employment and engagement agreements with our executive officers and directors. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in us incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against our directors and officers, which the Company may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage us from bringing a lawsuit against our directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers, even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders.\nOur directors have the right to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock and additional shares of our common stock.\nOur directors, within the limitations and restrictions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation and without further action by our stockholders, have the authority to issue shares of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series and to fix the number of shares and the relative rights, conversion rights, voting rights, and terms of redemption, liquidation preferences and any other preferences, special rights and qualifications of any such series. Any issuance of shares of preferred stock could adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock. Should we issue additional shares of our common stock at a later time, each investor\u2019s ownership interest in our stock would be proportionally reduced.\nAnti-takeover provisions may impede the acquisition of the Company.\nCertain provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL) have anti-takeover effects and may inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination. These provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring control of us to negotiate with, and to obtain the approval of, our directors, in connection with such a transaction. As a result, certain of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of the Company, including an acquisition in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, we can also authorize \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock.\nCompliance, Reporting and Listing Risks\nWe incur significant costs to ensure compliance with U.S. and NASDAQ Capital Market reporting and corporate governance requirements.\nWe incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and with applicable U.S. and NASDAQ Capital Market corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Capital Market. The rules of The NASDAQ Capital Market include requiring us to maintain independent directors, comply with other corporate governance requirements and pay annual listing and stock issuance fees. All of such SEC and NASDAQ obligations require a commitment of additional resources including, but not limited, to additional expenses, and may result in the diversion of our senior management\u2019s time and attention from our day-to-day operations. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. We also expect that these applicable rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\nWe will continue to incur increased costs as a result of being a reporting company, and given our limited capital resources, such additional costs may have an adverse impact on our profitability.\nWe are an SEC-reporting company. The rules and regulations under the Exchange Act require reporting companies to provide periodic reports with interactive data files, which require that we engage legal, accounting and auditing professionals, and eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) and EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) service providers. The engagement of such services can be costly, and we may continue to incur additional losses, which may adversely affect our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as a variety of related rules implemented by the SEC, have required changes in corporate governance practices and generally increased the disclosure requirements of public companies. For example, as a result of being a reporting company, we are required to file periodic and current reports and other information with the SEC and we have adopted policies regarding disclosure controls and procedures and regularly evaluate those controls and procedures.\nThe additional costs we continue to incur in connection with being a reporting company (expected to be several hundred thousand dollars per year) will continue to further stretch our limited capital resources. Due to our limited resources, we have to allocate resources away from other productive uses in order to continue to comply with our obligations as an SEC reporting company. Further, there is no guarantee that we will have sufficient resources to continue to meet our reporting and filing obligations with the SEC as they come due.\nWe may not be able to comply with NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing standards.\nOur common stock and warrants trade on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols \u201cATNF\u201d and \u201cATNFW,\u201d respectively. Notwithstanding such listing, there can be no assurance any broker will be interested in trading our securities. Therefore, it may be difficult to sell your securities if you desire or need to sell them. There is also no guarantee that we will be able to maintain our listings on The NASDAQ Capital Market for any period of time by perpetually satisfying NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements. Our failure to continue to meet these requirements may result in our securities being delisted from NASDAQ.\nAmong the conditions required for continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market, NASDAQ requires us to maintain at least $2.5 million in stockholders\u2019 equity, $35 million of market value of listed securities, or $500,000 in net income over the prior two years or two of the prior three years, to have a majority of independent directors, and to maintain a stock price over $1.00 per share. Our stockholders\u2019 equity may not remain above NASDAQ\u2019s $2.5 million minimum, our market value of listed securities may not remain above $35,000,000, we may not generate over $500,000 of yearly net income, we may not be able to maintain independent directors, and we may not be able to maintain a stock price over $1.00 per share. Furthermore, we are required to maintain a majority of independent directors and at least three members on our audit committee.\nIf we fail to comply with NASDAQ rules and requirements, our stock may be delisted. In addition, even if we demonstrate compliance with the requirements above, we will have to continue to meet other objective and subjective listing requirements to continue to be listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. Delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market could make trading our common stock and/or warrants more difficult for investors, potentially leading to declines in our share price and liquidity. Without a NASDAQ Capital Market listing, stockholders may have a difficult time getting a quote for the sale or purchase of our stock, the sale or purchase of our stock would likely be made more difficult and the trading volume and liquidity of our stock could decline. Delisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market could also result in negative publicity and could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. The absence of such a listing may adversely affect the acceptance of our common stock and/or warrants as currency or the value accorded by other parties. Further, if we are delisted, we would also incur additional costs under state blue sky laws in connection with any sales of our securities. These requirements could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and/or warrants and the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock and/or warrants in the secondary market. If our common stock and/or warrants are delisted by NASDAQ, our common stock and/or warrants may be eligible to trade on an over-the-counter quotation system, such as the OTCQB Market, where an investor may find it more difficult to sell our stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock and/or warrants. In the event our common stock and/or warrants are delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market, we may not be able to list our common stock and/or warrants on another national securities exchange or obtain quotation on an over-the counter quotation system.\nWe may experience adverse impacts on our reported results of operations as a result of adopting new accounting standards or interpretations.\nOur implementation of and compliance with changes in accounting rules, including new accounting rules and interpretations, could adversely affect our reported financial position or operating results or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our reported operating results in future periods.\nRisks Relating to The JOBS Act\nThe JOBS Act allows us to postpone the date by which we must comply with certain laws and regulations and to reduce the amount of information provided in reports filed with the SEC. We cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are and we will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenues equal or exceed $1.07 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) the last day of the end of our 2022 fiscal year (5 years from our first public offering), (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d (with at least $700 million in public float) under the Exchange Act. For so long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d as described in further detail in the risk factors below. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on some or all of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. If we avail ourselves of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements, as is currently our plan, our reduced disclosure may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate us and may result in less investor confidence.\nOur election not to opt out of the JOBS Act extended accounting transition period may not make our financial statements easily comparable to other companies.\nPursuant to the JOBS Act, as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, we can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) or the SEC. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, can adopt the standard for the private company. This may make a comparison of our financial statements with any other public company which is not either an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d nor an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d which has opted out of using the extended transition period, more difficult or impossible as possible different or revised standards may be used.\nThe JOBS Act also allows us to postpone the date by which we must comply with certain laws and regulations intended to protect investors and to reduce the amount of information provided in reports filed with the SEC.\nThe JOBS Act is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d. The Company meets the definition of an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and so long as it qualifies as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d it will, among other things:\n\u25cf be exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that its independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting;\n\u25cf be exempt from the \u201csay on pay\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers) and the \u201csay on golden parachute\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations) of The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and certain disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to compensation of Chief Executive Officers;\n\u25cf be permitted to omit the detailed compensation discussion and analysis from proxy statements and reports filed under the Exchange Act and instead provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation; and\n\u25cf be exempt from any rules that may be adopted by the PCAOB requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report on the financial statements.\nThe Company currently intends to take advantage of all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to it so long as it qualifies as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d. The Company has elected not to opt out of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act. Among other things, this means that the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting so long as it qualifies as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in the internal control over financial reporting go undetected. Likewise, so long as it qualifies as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, the Company may elect not to provide certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of executive officers, which it would otherwise have been required to provide in filings with the SEC, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate the Company. As a result, investor confidence in the Company and the market price of its common stock may be adversely affected.\nNotwithstanding the above, we are also currently a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d, meaning that we are not an investment company, an asset-backed issuer, or a majority-owned subsidiary of a parent company that is not a smaller reporting company and have a public float of less than $250 million and/or less than $100 million in annual revenues and a total public float less than $700 million during the most recently completed fiscal year. In the event that we are still considered a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d, at such time as we cease being an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d, the disclosure we will be required to provide in our SEC filings will increase, but will still be less than it would be if we were not considered either an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d or a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d. Specifically, similar to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d, \u201csmaller reporting companies\u201d are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in their filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in their SEC filings, including, among other things, only being required to provide two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Decreased disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d or \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d may make it harder for investors to analyze the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial prospects.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nProvisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred shares, which may make it more difficult for the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together, these provisions may make it more difficult for the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nFailure to adequately manage our planned aggressive growth strategy may harm our business or increase our risk of failure.\nFor the foreseeable future, we intend to pursue an aggressive growth strategy for the expansion of our operations through increased product development and marketing. Our ability to rapidly expand our operations will depend upon many factors, including our ability to work in a regulated environment, market value-added products effectively to independent pharmacies, establish and maintain strategic relationships with suppliers, and obtain adequate capital resources on acceptable terms. Any restrictions on our ability to expand may have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Accordingly, we may be unable to achieve our targets for sales growth, and our operations may not be successful or achieve anticipated operating results.\nAdditionally, our growth may place a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, and financial resources and our infrastructure. Our future success will depend, in part, upon the ability of our senior management to manage growth effectively. This will require us to, among other things:\n\u25cf implement additional management information systems;\n\u25cf further develop our operating, administrative, legal, financial, and accounting systems and controls;\n\u25cf hire additional personnel;\n\u25cf develop additional levels of management within our company;\n\u25cf locate additional office space;\n\u25cf maintain close coordination among our engineering, operations, legal, finance, sales and marketing, and client service and support organizations; and\n\u25cf manage our expanding international operations.\nAs a result, we may lack the resources to deploy our services on a timely and cost-effective basis. Failure to accomplish any of these requirements could impair our ability to deliver services in a timely fashion or attract and retain new customers.\nOur proprietary information, or that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, may be lost or we may suffer security breaches.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we expect to collect and store sensitive data, including valuable and commercially sensitive intellectual property, clinical trial data, its proprietary business information and that of our future customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers, clinical trial subjects and employees, patients, in its data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and our ability to conduct clinical trials, which could adversely affect our business and reputation and lead to delays in gaining regulatory approvals for our future product candidates. Although we maintain business interruption insurance coverage, our insurance might not cover all losses from any future breaches of our systems.\nFailure of our information technology systems, including cybersecurity attacks or other data security incidents, could significantly disrupt the operation of our business.\nOur business increasingly depends on the use of information technologies, which means that certain key areas such as research and development, production and sales are to a large extent dependent on our information systems or those of third-party providers. Our ability to execute our business plan and to comply with regulators\u2019 requirements with respect to data control and data integrity, depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems, or IT systems and the IT systems supplied by third-party service providers. As information systems and the use of software and related applications by our company, our business partners, suppliers, and customers become more cloud-based, there has been an increase in global cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats, including more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks that pose a risk to the security of our information systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data and information. In addition, our IT systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and backup measures, some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Despite the precautionary measures we and our third-party service providers have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our IT systems, a successful cybersecurity attack or other data security incident could result in the misappropriation and/or loss of confidential or personal information, create system interruptions, or deploy malicious software that attacks our systems. It is also possible that a cybersecurity attack might not be noticed for some period of time. In addition, sustained or repeated system failures or problems arising during the upgrade of any of our IT systems that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data, and in particular to operate our proprietary technology platform, could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. The occurrence of a cybersecurity attack or incident could result in business interruptions from the disruption of our IT systems, or negative publicity resulting in reputational damage with our stockholders and other stakeholders and/or increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. In addition, the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information could expose us or other third-parties to regulatory fines or penalties, litigation and potential liability, or otherwise harm our business.\nWe may acquire other companies which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nWe may in the future seek to acquire businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our product offerings, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. If we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully, effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf incurrence of acquisition-related costs;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;\n\u25cf harm to our existing business relationships with collaboration partners as a result of the acquisition;\n\u25cf harm to our brand and reputation;\n\u25cf the potential loss of key employees;\n\u25cf use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and\n\u25cf use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.\nIn the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results arising from the impairment assessment process. Acquisitions may also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIf we make any acquisitions, they may disrupt or have a negative impact on our business.\nIf we make acquisitions in the future, funding permitting, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, we could have difficulty integrating the acquired company\u2019s assets, personnel and operations with our own. We do not anticipate that any acquisitions or mergers we may enter into in the future would result in a change of control of the Company. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired business may not be willing to work for us. We cannot predict the effect expansion may have on our core business. Regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition, the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase our expenses. In addition to the risks described above, acquisitions are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u25cf the difficulty of integrating acquired products, services or operations;\n\u25cf the potential disruption of the ongoing businesses and distraction of our management and the management of acquired companies;\n\u25cf difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u25cf the potential impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel;\n\u25cf the potential inability or failure to achieve additional sales and enhance our customer base through cross-marketing of the products to new and existing customers;\n\u25cf the effect of any government regulations which relate to the business acquired;\n\u25cf potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses or product lines, or the need to spend significant amounts to retool, reposition or modify the marketing and sales of acquired products or operations, or the defense of any litigation, whether or not successful, resulting from actions of the acquired company prior to our acquisition; and\n\u25cf potential expenses under the labor, environmental and other laws of various jurisdictions.\nOur business could be severely impaired if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition, many of which cannot be presently identified. These risks and problems could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may apply working capital and future funding to uses that ultimately do not improve our operating results or increase the value of our securities.\nIn general, we have complete discretion over the use of our working capital and any new investment capital we may obtain in the future. Because of the number and variety of factors that could determine our use of funds, our ultimate expenditure of funds (and their uses) may vary substantially from our current intended operating plan for such funds.\nWe intend to use existing working capital and future funding to support the development of our products and services, product purchases in our wholesale distribution division, the expansion of our marketing, or the support of operations to educate our customers. We will also use capital for market and network expansion, acquisitions, and general working capital purposes. However, we do not have more specific plans for the use and expenditure of our capital. Our management has broad discretion to use any or all of our available capital reserves. Our capital could be applied in ways that do not improve our operating results or otherwise increase the value of a stockholder\u2019s investment.\nWe have never paid or declared any dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never paid or declared any dividends on our common stock or preferred stock. Likewise, we do not anticipate paying, in the near future, dividends or distributions on our common stock. Any future dividends on common stock will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend, among other things, on our earnings, our financial requirements for future operations and growth, and other facts as we may then deem appropriate. Since we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock, return on your investment, if any, will depend solely on an increase, if any, in the market value of our common stock.\nStockholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock.\nWherever possible, our board of directors will attempt to use non-cash consideration to satisfy obligations. In many instances, we believe that the non-cash consideration will consist of restricted shares of our common stock or where shares are to be issued to our officers, directors and applicable consultants. Our board of directors has authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, but subject to NASDAQ rules and regulations (which generally require stockholder approval for any transactions which would result in the issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock), to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market. These actions will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders, which may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management\u2019s ability to maintain control of the Company because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.\nIn order to grow our business, we anticipate that we will need to continue to depend on our relationships with third parties, including our technology providers. Identifying partners, and negotiating and documenting relationships with them, requires significant time and resources. Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to third parties to favor their products or services, or utilization of, our products and services. In addition, acquisitions of our partners by our competitors could result in a decrease in the number of our current and potential customers. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our results of operations may suffer. Even if we are successful, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in increased customer use of our products or increased revenue.\nClaims, litigation, government investigations, and other proceedings may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are currently subject to, and expect to continue to be regularly subject to, actual and threatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings. In addition, we have filed lawsuits against certain parties for matters we discovered which related to KBL, prior to the Business Combination. Any of these types of proceedings may have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of our operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. Our current legal proceedings are described in \u201cNote 12 - Commitments and Contingencies\u201d, under the heading \u201cLitigation and Other Loss Contingencies\u201d, in the consolidated financial statements included herein beginning on page. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves and possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings, including as a result of a settlement, could require us to make substantial future payments, prevent us from offering certain products or services, require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our operations.\nFor all of the foregoing reasons and others set forth herein, an investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk.", "PERMNO": 16788, "SIC": 9995, "TIC": "KBLM"}
