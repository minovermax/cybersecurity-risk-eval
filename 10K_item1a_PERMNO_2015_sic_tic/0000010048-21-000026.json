{"cik": "10048", "company": "BARNWELL INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-12-21", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe business of Barnwell and its subsidiaries face numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Form 10-K or in Barnwell\u2019s other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that Barnwell faces. If any of the following risk factors should occur, our profitability, financial condition or liquidity could be materially negatively impacted.\nEntity-Wide Risks\nOur business operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, which resulted in the global health pandemic referred to as COVID-19.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic and the United States and Canadian governments declared the virus a national emergency shortly thereafter. The ongoing global health crisis (including resurgences) resulting from the pandemic have, and continue to, disrupt the normal operations of many businesses, including the temporary closure or scale-back of business operations and/or the imposition of either quarantine or remote work or meeting requirements for employees, either by government order or on a voluntary basis. While the outbreak recently appeared to be trending downward, particularly as vaccination rates increased, new variants of COVID-19 continue emerging, including the highly transmissible Delta variant and the newly-discovered Omicron variant (currently a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d), spreading throughout the U.S. and globally and causing significant uncertainty. The global economy, our markets and our business have been, and may continue to be, materially and adversely affected by COVID-19.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak materially and adversely affected our business operations and financial condition as a result of the deteriorating market outlook, the global economic recession and weakened liquidity. Although demand for oil and oil prices has recovered from the lows of March through May of the prior year, uncertainty regarding future oil prices has impacted and continues to impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and outlook. While the Company\u2019s contract drilling segment remained operational throughout fiscal 2020 and 2021 and continues to work, the continuing potential impact of COVID-19 on the health of our contract drilling segment's crews and ability or desire for customers to continue such work is uncertain, and any discontinuation of contracts currently in backlog would result in a material adverse impact to the Company\u2019s financial condition and outlook. Though availability of vaccines and reopening of state and local economies has improved the outlook for recovery from COVID-19's impacts, the impact of the Delta or Omicron variant or other new, more contagious or lethal variants that may emerge, the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the Delta or Omicron variant or such other variants and the related responses by governments, including reinstated government-imposed lockdowns or other measures, cannot be predicted at this time. Both the health and economic aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic remain highly fluid and the future course of each is uncertain. We cannot foresee whether the outbreak of COVID-19 will be effectively contained on a sustained basis, nor can we predict the severity and duration of its impact. If the outbreak of COVID-19 is not effectively and timely controlled on a sustained basis going forward, our business operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected by factors that we cannot foresee. Any of these factors and other factors beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the overall business environment, cause uncertainties in the regions where we conduct business, cause our business to suffer in ways that we cannot predict and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the Continued Listing Criteria of the NYSE American and our failure to maintain continued compliance with the listing requirements of the NYSE American exchange could result in the delisting of our common stock.\nOur common stock is listed on the NYSE American. In order to maintain this listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of stockholders\u2019 equity and a minimum number of public stockholders. In addition to these objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer if, in its opinion, the issuer\u2019s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American\u2019s listing requirements; if an issuer\u2019s common stock sells at what the NYSE American considers a \u201clow selling price\u201d (generally trading below $0.20 per share for an extended period of time); or if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE American, in its opinion, inadvisable.\nOn January 13, 2020, the Company received notice from the NYSE American that the Company was not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(i) and Section 1003(a)(ii) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the \u201cGuide\u201d), which respectively require an issuer to have (i) stockholders\u2019 equity of $2.0 million or more if such issuer reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in two of its three most recent fiscal years and (ii) stockholders\u2019 equity of $4.0 million or more if such issuer reported losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in three of its four most recent fiscal years, since we reported stockholders\u2019 equity of $1.2 million as of September 30, 2019 and net losses in three of the last four most recent fiscal years then ended, and that the Company\u2019s common stock could be at risk of being delisted.\nIn accordance with the NYSE American\u2019s policies and procedures, we subsequently submitted a plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d) to the NYSE American detailing the steps we planned to take to raise our stockholders\u2019 equity above $4.0 million and regain compliance with Section 1003(a)(i) and Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Guide. On April 2, 2020, the NYSE American notified the Company that it accepted the Plan and granted the Company an extension for its continued listing until July 13, 2021.\nOn July 13, 2021, the Company filed a Form 8-K report with the Securities and Exchange Commission announcing that the Company\u2019s pro forma stockholders\u2019 equity (unaudited) as of July 13, 2021 was projected to be above the $4.0 million required to comply with Section 1003(a)(i) and Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Guide. Accordingly, in a letter dated July 14, 2021, the NYSE American determined the Company had resolved the continued listing deficiency with respect to Section 1003(a)(i) and Section 1003(a)(ii) of the Guide and notified the Company that it had successfully regained compliance with the NYSE American continued listing standards.\nAccordingly, the Company continues to be subject to the normal continued listing criteria of the NYSE American. However, if the company, within 12 months of July 14, 2021, is again determined to be below any of the continued listing standards, the NYSE American staff will examine the relationship between the two incidents of falling below continued listing standards and re-evaluate the Company's method of financial recovery from the first incident. It will then take appropriate action, which, depending upon the circumstances, may include truncating the procedures described above or immediately initiating delisting proceedings. If the NYSE American delists our common stock, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of a trading market for our common stock, reduced liquidity, and an inability for us to obtain financing to fund our operations.\nStockholders may be diluted significantly through our efforts to obtain financing and satisfy obligations through the issuance of securities.\nOur Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the stockholders, subject to the requirements of the NYSE American (which generally require stockholder approval for any transactions which would result in the issuance of more than 20% of our then outstanding shares of common stock or voting rights representing over 20% of our then outstanding shares of stock, subject to certain exceptions, including sales in public offerings and/or sales which are undertaken at or above the greater of the book value and/or market value of the issuer\u2019s common stock on the date the transaction is agreed to be completed), to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares of common stock or warrants to purchase such shares of common stock. In addition, we may attempt to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock, possibly at a discount to market in the future. These actions would result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing stockholders and may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. A related effect of such issuances may enhance existing large stockholders\u2019 influence on the Company, including that of Alexander Kinzler, our Chief Executive Officer.\nA small number of stockholders, including our CEO, own a significant amount of our common stock and have influence over our business regardless of the opposition of other stockholders.\nAs of September 30, 2021, the CEO, who is a member of the Board of Directors, and two other stockholders hold approximately 39% of our outstanding common stock. The interests of one or more of these stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of other stockholders. These stockholders have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of our directors, and could accelerate, delay, deter or prevent a change of control of the Company. The significant stockholders who are also members of the Board of Directors could significantly affect our business, policies and affairs.\nOur operations are subject to currency rate fluctuations.\nOur operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar. Our financial statements, presented in U.S. dollars, may be affected by foreign currency fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Volatility in exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations, particularly through the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar which may affect the relative prices at which we sell our oil and natural gas and may affect the cost of certain items required in our operations. To date, we have not entered into foreign currency hedging transactions to control or minimize these risks.\nAdverse changes in actuarial assumptions used to calculate retirement plan costs due to economic or other factors, or lower returns on plan assets could adversely affect Barnwell\u2019s results and financial condition.\nRetirement plan cash funding obligations and plan expenses and obligations are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and could increase in future years depending on numerous factors, including the performance of the financial markets, specifically the equity markets, levels of interest rates, and the cost of health care insurance premiums.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and could continue to fluctuate substantially.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and could fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022fluctuations in commodity prices;\n\u2022variations in results of operations;\n\u2022announcements by us and our competitors;\n\u2022legislative or regulatory changes;\n\u2022general trends in the industry;\n\u2022general market conditions;\n\u2022litigation; and\n\u2022other events applicable to our industries.\nFailure to retain key personnel could hurt our operations.\nWe require highly skilled and experienced personnel to operate our business. In addition to competing in highly competitive industries, we compete in a highly competitive labor market. Our business could be adversely affected by an inability to retain personnel or upward pressure on wages as a result of the highly competitive labor market. Further, there are significant personal liability risks to Barnwell of Canada's individual officers and directors related to well clean-up costs that may affect our ability to attract or retain the necessary people.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and benefit from certain reduced governance and disclosure requirements, including that our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot be certain if the omission of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nCurrently, we are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d meaning that our outstanding common stock held by nonaffiliates had a value of less than $250 million at the end of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, meaning our auditors are not required to attest to the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. As a result, investors and others may be less comfortable with the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal controls and the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in internal controls go undetected may increase. In addition, as a smaller reporting company, we take advantage of our ability to provide certain other less comprehensive disclosures in our SEC filings, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports and simplified executive compensation disclosures. Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects, as the information we provide to stockholders may be different from what one might receive from other public companies in which one hold shares. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information.\nRisks Related to Oil and Natural Gas Segment\nAcquisitions or discoveries of additional reserves are needed to increase our oil and natural gas segment operating results and cash flow.\nIn August 2018, Barnwell made a significant reinvestment into its oil and natural gas segment with the acquisition of the Twining property in Alberta, Canada. The Company believes there are potential undeveloped reserves for which significant future capital expenditures will be needed to convert those potential undeveloped reserves into developed reserves. If future circumstances are such that we are not able to make the capital expenditures necessary to convert potential undeveloped reserves to developed reserves, we will not replace the amount of reserves produced and sold and our reserves and oil and natural gas segment operating results and cash flows will decline accordingly, and we may be forced to sell some of our oil and natural gas segment assets under untimely or unfavorable terms. Any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture oil and natural gas operating results and cash flow are highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves on an economic basis. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing or acquiring additional reserves and our current financial resources may be insufficient to make such investments. Furthermore, if oil or natural gas prices increase, our cost for additional reserves could also increase.\nWe may not realize an adequate return on oil and natural gas investments.\nDrilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs. The wells we drill or participate in may not be productive, and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in those wells. If future oil and natural gas segment acquisition and development activities are not successful it could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition.\nOil and natural gas prices are highly volatile and further declines, or extended low prices will significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nMuch of our revenues and cash flow are greatly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Lower oil and natural gas prices not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis, but also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce economically, if any. Prices that do not produce sufficient operating margins will have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition, operating cash flows, borrowing ability, reserves, and the amount of capital that we are able to allocate for the acquisition and development of oil and natural gas reserves.\nVarious factors beyond our control affect prices of oil and natural gas including, but not limited to, changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, weather, worldwide political instability, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the level of consumer product demand, government regulations and taxes, the price and availability of alternative fuels and the overall economic environment. Energy prices are also subject to other political and regulatory actions outside our control, which may include changes in the policies of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or other developments involving or affecting oil-producing countries, or actions or reactions of the government of the United States in anticipation of or in response to such developments.\nThe inability of one or more of our working interest partners to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.\nFor our operated properties, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective shares of costs. Some of our non-operating partners may experience liquidity problems and may not be able to meet their financial obligations. Nonperformance by a non-operating partner could result in significant financial losses.\nLiquidity problems encountered by our working interest partners or the third party operators of our non-operated properties may also result in significant financial losses as the other working interest partners or third party operators may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due. In the event a third party operator of a non-operated property becomes insolvent, it may result in increased operating expenses and cash required for abandonment liabilities if the Company is required to take over operatorship. Barnwell holds an 11% working interest, the largest working interest other than that held by the operator, in a property with approximately 82 wells and 7 facilities where the operator is in receivership.\nWe may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local, provincial and federal legislation. A violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of \u201cclean up\u201d orders. Legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations. Although we have recorded a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations.\nBarnwell's oil and natural gas segment is subject to the provisions of the AER\u2019s LLR program. Under the LLR program the AER calculates a LMR for a company based on the ratio of the company\u2019s deemed assets over its deemed liabilities relating to wells and facilities for which the company is the licensed operator and imposes a security deposit on operators whose estimated liabilities exceed their deemed asset value. At September 30, 2021, the Company had sufficient deemed asset value that no security deposit was due. However, decreases in prices and production and related netbacks from relevant properties could result in a decline in the Company's deemed asset value to a point where a deposit could be due in the future. The current liability framework is under revision by the AER. A percentage-based retirement framework is expected to be introduced, but further details are unknown at this time.\nThe AER requires purchasers of AER licensed oil and natural gas assets to have an LMR of 2.0 or higher immediately following the transfer of a license. This LMR requirement for well transfers hinders our ability to generate capital by selling oil and natural gas assets as there are less qualified buyers.\nA requirement to provide security deposit funds to the AER in the future would result in the diversion of cash on hand and operating cash flows that could otherwise be used to fund oil and natural gas reserve replacement efforts, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If Barnwell fails to comply with the requirements of the LLR program, Barnwell's oil and natural gas subsidiary would be subject to the AER's enforcement provisions which could include suspension of operations and non-compliance fees and could ultimately result in the\nAER serving the Company with a closure order to shut-in all operated wells. Additionally, if Barnwell is non-compliant, the Company would be prohibited from transferring well licenses which would prohibit us from selling any oil and natural gas assets until the required cash deposit is made with the AER.\nWe are not fully insured against certain environmental risks, either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs. In particular, insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time, as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages, is not available on economically reasonable terms. Accordingly, any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow. Should we be unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem, we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy.\nWe may fail to fully identify potential problems related to acquired reserves or to properly estimate those reserves.\nWe periodically evaluate acquisitions of reserves, properties, prospects and leaseholds and other strategic transactions that appear to fit within our overall business strategy. Our evaluation includes an assessment of reserves, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, potential for future drilling and production, validity of the seller\u2019s title to the properties and potential environmental issues, litigation and other liabilities.\nIn connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities or title defects in excess of the amounts claimed by us before closing and acquire properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis.\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and future production rates and costs with respect to acquired properties, and actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates.\nIf oil and natural gas prices decline, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties.\nOil and natural gas prices affect the value of our oil and natural gas properties as determined in our full cost ceiling calculation. Any future ceiling test write-downs will result in reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge to earnings.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive.\nWe compete for capital, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands, skilled personnel, access to drilling rigs, service rigs and other equipment, access to processing facilities, pipeline capacity and in many other respects with a substantial number of other organizations, most of which have greater technical and financial resources than we do. Some of these organizations explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas, carry on refining operations and market oil and other products on a worldwide basis. As a result of these complementary activities, some of our competitors may have competitive resources that are greater and more diverse than ours. Furthermore, many of our competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and natural gas production, such as changing prices and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations. If our competitors are able to capitalize on these competitive resources, it could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nAn increase in operating costs greater than anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nHigher operating costs for our properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us. Electricity, supplies, and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation. The need for significant repairs and maintenance of infrastructure may increase as our properties age. A significant increase in operating costs could negatively impact operating results and cash flow.\nOur operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nOur business depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities. Canadian federal and provincial, as well as United States federal and state, regulation of oil and natural gas production, processing and transportation, tax and energy policies, general economic conditions, and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas. If market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production, overall production or realized prices may decline.\nWe are not the operator and have limited influence over the operations of certain of our oil and natural gas properties.\nWe hold minority interests in certain of our oil and natural gas properties. As a result, we cannot control the pace of exploration or development, major decisions affecting the drilling of wells, the plan for development and production at non-operated properties, or the timing and amount of costs related to abandonment and reclamation activities although contract provisions give Barnwell certain consent rights in some matters. The operator\u2019s influence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures. Additionally, as certain underlying joint venture data is not accessible to us, we depend on the operators at non-operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information. We also depend on operators and joint operators to maintain the financial resources to fund their share of all abandonment and reclamation costs.\nActual reserves will vary from reserve estimates.\nEstimating reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserves estimation process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein are only estimates. Ultimately, actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates, and those variations may be material. The estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions, including, among others:\n\u2022oil and natural gas prices as prescribed by SEC regulations;\n\u2022historical production from our wells compared with production rates from similar producing wells in the area;\n\u2022future commodity prices, production and development costs, royalties and capital expenditures;\n\u2022initial production rates;\n\u2022production decline rates;\n\u2022ultimate recovery of reserves;\n\u2022success of future development activities;\n\u2022marketability of production;\n\u2022effects of government regulation; and\n\u2022other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves.\nIf these factors, assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate, actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates.\nSEC rules could limit our ability to book additional proved undeveloped reserves (\u201cPUDs\u201d) in the future.\nSEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, PUDs may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This requirement may limit our ability to book PUDs as we pursue our drilling program.\nPart of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques. The results of our drilling are subject to drilling and completion technique risks, and results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production.\nMany of our operations involve, and are planned to utilize, the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by our service providers in order to maximize production and ultimate recoveries and therefore generate the highest possible returns. Risks we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, the inability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, the inability to run tools and other equipment the entire length of the well bore during completion operations, the inability to recover such tools and other equipment, and the inability to successfully clean out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation. Ultimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, limited access to gathering systems and takeaway capacity, and/or prices for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids decline, then the return on our investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as we anticipated and we could incur material write-downs of oil and gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nProduction and reserves, if any, attributable to the use of enhanced recovery methods are inherently difficult to predict. If our enhanced recovery methods do not allow for the extraction of crude oil, natural gas, and associated liquids in a manner or to the extent that we anticipate, we may not realize an acceptable return on our investments in such projects.\nDelays in business operations could adversely affect the amount and timing of our cash inflows.\nIn addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties, and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us, payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by:\n\u2022restrictions imposed by lenders;\n\u2022accounting delays;\n\u2022delays in the sale or delivery of products;\n\u2022delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system;\n\u2022blowouts or other accidents;\n\u2022adjustments for prior periods;\n\u2022recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties; and\n\u2022the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses.\nAny of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks.\nThe oil and natural gas market in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance.\nOur operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas. These risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures, premature declines of reservoirs, blow-outs, equipment failures and other accidents, cratering, sour gas releases, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, adverse weather conditions, pollution, other environmental risks, fires and spills. A number of these risks could result in personal injury, loss of life, or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others.\nWhile we carry various levels of insurance, we could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings. We cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above, nor are all of these risks insurable. There is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks listed above. We could face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive.\nDeficiencies in operating practices and record keeping, if any, may increase our risks and liabilities relating to incidents such as spills and releases and may increase the level of regulatory enforcement actions.\nOur operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks, particularly in Canada and the United States.\nBarnwell\u2019s oil and natural gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations, particularly in Canada and the United States, such as restrictions on production, restrictions on imports and exports, the maintenance of specified reserves, tax increases and retroactive tax claims, expropriation of property, cancellation of contract rights, environmental protection controls, environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers\u2019 health and safety. Further, the right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia is controlled by the governments of each of those provinces. Changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases, permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on Barnwell\u2019s operations. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in Canada; 57% in fiscal 2021.\nAdditionally, our ability to compete in the Canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which Canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests. Furthermore, we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the U.S.\nGovernment regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety, environmental protection, pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination. Environmental regulations, in particular, prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical, increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault. In addition, governmental regulations may discourage our customers\u2019 activities, reducing demand for our products and services.\nCompliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations.\nTax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local, regional and national authorities. Income tax laws, other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our stockholders. It is also possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in Canada, including the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes, and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nUnforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves.\nAlthough we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property, such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets. If such a defect were to occur, our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized.\nRisks Related to Land Investment Segment\nReceipt of future payments from KD I and KD II and cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships is dependent upon the developer\u2019s continued efforts and ability to develop and market the property.\nWe are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential lots sold within the Kaupulehu area by KD I and KD II as well as a percentage of future distributions KD II makes to its members. However, in order to collect such payments we are reliant upon the developer, KD I and KD II, in which we own a non-controlling ownership interest, to continue to market the remaining lots within Increment I and to proceed with the development or sale of the remaining portion of Increment II. Additionally, future cash distributions from the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, which includes KD I and KD II, are also dependent on future lot sales in Increment I by KD I and the development or sale of Increment II by KD II. It is uncertain when or if KD II will develop or sell the remaining portion of Increment II, and there is no assurance with regards to the amounts of future sales from Increments I and II. We do not have a controlling interest in the partnerships, and therefore are dependent on the general partner for development decisions. The receipt of future payments and cash distributions could be jeopardized if the developer fails to proceed with development and marketing of the property.\nWe hold investment interests in unconsolidated land development partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, in which we do not have a controlling interest. These investments involve risks and are highly illiquid.\nThese investments involve risks which include:\n\u2022the lack of a controlling interest in these partnerships and, therefore, the inability to require that the entities sell assets, return invested capital or take any other action without obtaining the majority vote of partners;\n\u2022potential for future additional capital contributions to fund operations and development activities;\n\u2022the adverse impact on overall profitability if the entities do not achieve the financial results projected;\n\u2022the reallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives and/or an increase in indebtedness to pay potential future additional capital contributions, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;\n\u2022undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs and which could delay or prevent development of the real estate held by the land development partnerships; and\n\u2022certain underlying partnership data is not accessible to us, therefore we depend on the general partner to provide us with reliable accounting information.\nWe may be required to write-down the carrying value of our investment in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships if our assumptions about future lot sales and profitability prove incorrect. Any write-down would negatively impact our results of operations.\nIn analyzing the value of our investment in the Kukio Resort Land Development Partnerships, we have made assumptions about the level of future lot sales, operating and development costs, cash generation and market conditions. These assumptions are based on management\u2019s and the general partner\u2019s best estimates and if the actual results differ significantly from these assumptions, we may not be able to realize the value of the assets recorded, which could lead to an impairment of certain of these assets in the future. Such a write-down would have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur land investment business is concentrated in the state of Hawaii. As a result, our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of Hawaii, particularly the island of Hawaii.\nBarnwell\u2019s land investment segment is impacted by the condition of Hawaii\u2019s real estate market, which is affected by Hawaii\u2019s economy and Hawaii\u2019s tourism industry, as well as the United States and world economies in general. Any future cash flows from Barnwell\u2019s land development activities are subject to, among other factors, the level of real estate activity and prices, the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of Hawaii, the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor, the introduction of building code modifications, changes to zoning laws, and the level of confidence in Hawaii\u2019s economy.\nThe occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business.\nThe occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our land investments. The occurrence of a natural disaster could also cause property and flood insurance rates and deductibles to increase, which could reduce demand for real estate in Hawaii.\nRisks Related to Contract Drilling Segment\nDemand for water well drilling and/or pump installation is volatile. A decrease in demand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nDemand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of Hawaii. As also noted above, the real estate development industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local, regional, and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates, housing demand, population growth, employment levels and job growth and property taxes. A decrease in water well drilling and/or pump installation contracts will result in decreased revenues and operating results.\nIf we are unable to accurately estimate the overall risks, requirements or costs when bidding on or negotiating a contract that is ultimately awarded, we may achieve a lower than anticipated profit or incur a loss on the contract.\nContracts are usually fixed price per lineal foot drilled and require the provision of line-item materials at a fixed unit price based on approved quantities irrespective of actual per unit costs. Under such contracts, prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates, which are based on a number of assumptions, many of which are beyond our control. Expected profits on contracts are realized\nonly if costs are accurately estimated and successfully controlled. We may not be able to obtain compensation for additional work performed or expenses incurred as a result of changes or inaccuracies in these estimates and underlying assumptions, such as unanticipated sub-surface site conditions, unanticipated technical problems, equipment failures, inefficiencies, cost of raw materials, schedule delays due to constraints on drilling hours, weather delays, or accidents. If cost estimates for a contract are inaccurate, or if the contract is not performed within cost estimates, then cost overruns may result in losses or cause the contract not to be as profitable as expected.\nA significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business.\nA significant portion of our contract drilling division revenues is derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies; 48% in fiscal 2021. Reduced tax revenues and governmental budgets may limit spending by local governments which in turn will affect the demand for our services. Material reductions in spending by a significant number of local governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial position.\nOur contract drilling operations face significant competition.\nWe face competition for our services from a variety of competitors. Many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require less labor. Our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree, quality of service. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe loss of or damage to key vendor, customer or sub-contractor relationships would adversely affect our operations.\nOur contract drilling business is dependent on our relationships with key vendors, customers and subcontractors. The loss of or damage to any of our key relationships could negatively affect our business.\nAwarding of contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain contract bid and performance bonds from insurers.\nThere can be no assurance that our ability to obtain such bonds will continue on the same basis as the past. Additionally, bonding insurance rates may increase and have an impact on our ability to win competitive bids, which could have a corresponding material impact on contract drilling operating results.\nThe contracts in our backlog are subject to change orders and cancellation.\nOur backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contracts that have been started and new contracts not yet started. Our contracts are subject to change orders and cancellations, and such changes could adversely affect our operations.\nThe occurrence of natural disasters in Hawaii could adversely affect our business.\nThe occurrence of a natural disaster in Hawaii such as, but not limited to, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanic activity, droughts and floods, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our contracts.", "PERMNO": 42358, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "BRN"}
