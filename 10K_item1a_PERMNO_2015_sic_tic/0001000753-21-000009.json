{"cik": "1000753", "company": "INSPERITY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe statements in this section describe the known material risks to our business and should be considered carefully.\nEconomic Risks\nAdverse economic conditions could negatively affect our industry, business, and results of operations.\nThe small and medium-sized business market is sensitive to changes in economic activity levels as well as the credit markets. As a result, the demand for the outsourced HR services we provide clients could be adversely impacted by weak economic conditions or difficulty obtaining credit. Current and prospective clients may respond to such conditions by reducing employment levels, compensation levels, employee benefit levels and outsourced HR services. In addition, during periods of weak economic conditions, current clients may have difficulty meeting their financial obligations to us and may select alternative HR services at more competitive rates than we offer. Further, our growth is partially dependent on hiring of new employees by our existing clients, which may be restricted during periods of tight labor markets and economic slowdown, such as the current period of high unemployment levels, and resulting reduced hiring within our existing client base. Such developments could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and future growth rates.\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting our business. The current pandemic may have, and a future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases could have, a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe spread of the COVID-19 virus has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, including actions taken by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic that have resulted or could result in a significant reduction in commercial activity. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, operations, financial results and financial condition will depend on numerous evolving factors that are highly uncertain and that we may not be able to accurately predict, including:\n\u2022scope, severity and duration of the pandemic;\n\u2022varying impact that the pandemic has within each locality;\n\u2022actions taken by government authorities to contain the outbreak or address its impact;\n\u2022development, distribution, adoption and cost of safe and effective treatments or vaccines for COVID-19;\n\u2022direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures;\n\u2022scope, significance and duration of business disruptions on small and medium-sized businesses, including any reduction in employment levels, compensation levels and employee benefits;\n\u2022magnitude and extent of business failures among the small and medium-sized businesses that we serve;\n\u2022ability of our clients to pay for the outsourced HR services and solutions we provide; and\n\u2022any resulting impact on the demand for our outsourced HR services and solutions.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic is continuing and even after it has subsided, we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business, operations and financial results due to any existing or continuing reduction in economic activity, including a recession or depression.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a sharp decrease in employment levels throughout the United States. During the second quarter of 2020, we began to experience a decline in the number of paid WSEEs due primarily to layoffs and temporary leaves of absence, resulting in a 1.8% year-over-year decline in the average number of paid WSEEs during the second quarter of 2020. However, for the full year 2020, the average number of paid WSEEs declined 0.6% to 234,223. Further, if the adverse economic conditions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic persist, we may continue to experience a decline in our paid WSEEs. Accordingly, such declines in WSEEs would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInsperity 20\n2020 Form 10-K\nThe spread of the COVID-19 virus has changed how and when we incur health insurance costs under our health insurance contract with United. We may experience changes in quarterly levels and timing of both medical and pharmaceutical health insurance claims. For example, government imposed treatment mandates, restrictions on certain elective healthcare treatments, and changes in treatment delivery options may significantly alter our healthcare claim trends. Our ability to estimate healthcare claim trends becomes more difficult as participant utilization of healthcare services are deferred or canceled while stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements are enacted by state and local governments. Furthermore, predicting the rate at which participants will increase utilization of healthcare services in subsequent periods once stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements are lifted, is also difficult. In addition, as the increased number of former WSEEs elect COBRA coverage to continue their benefits, we expect an increase in claim activity levels, resulting in higher benefits costs incurred and decreased profitability. The Department of Labor and the Department of Treasury released a rule on April 29, 2020 that extends the period during which any former WSEE who became eligible for COBRA coverage in 2020 may elect such coverage and allows any former WSEEs electing COBRA coverage to defer payment of such coverage until a later date. Depending on the number of participants electing COBRA and the resulting claim activity levels, COBRA-related claims have the potential to increase total plan costs in future periods as well. The extended period during which former WSEEs may elect COBRA coverage, and their ability to defer payment of related premiums, or any future legislation that increased COBRA participation, may further result in increased costs to us and we may ultimately be unable to collect premiums from those former WSEEs or from our clients.\nThe recent increase in U.S. unemployment levels has resulted in a significant increase in unemployment claims with state unemployment agencies. A continuous increase in unemployment claims is likely to increase state unemployment insurance tax rates. In addition, some states have the authority to increase unemployment tax rates retroactively. Any such increases, which are reflected in our comprehensive service fee, may result in client attrition due to increased prices or we may have to reduce our overall pricing, which would adversely affect our profitability, to assist clients with these additional costs.\nThe COVID-19 economic disruptions may cause customers to have difficulty meeting their financial obligations to us or increase business failures. As a co-employer, we assume the obligation to pay the salaries, wages and related benefits and taxes of the WSEEs. An increase in the number of clients unable to pay us would result in an increase in bad debts, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we have modified certain business and workforce practices (including those related to employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by governmental and regulatory authorities. While most of our operations can be performed remotely, there is no guarantee that we will be as effective while working remotely because our team is dispersed, many employees may have additional personal needs to attend to and employees may become sick themselves and be unable to work. Further, our increased reliance on remote access to our information systems as our employees work remotely impacts our control over cybersecurity protection and service stability and performance, which increases our exposure to cybersecurity and privacy issues and to disruptions to employee productivity. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, clients, partners and vendors. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19, in which case our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed, and we may be unable to respond to the needs of our business.\nThe FFCRA, the CARES Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 created various programs and incentives to assist businesses and individuals managing through the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain of these programs and incentives have required us to make changes to our systems that manage leave, payroll and payroll-related tax calculation and reporting and invoicing and collection of service fees. In addition, various states and localities and the federal government are considering further legislation that may require further changes to our processes and systems or that may expand the coverage afforded to WSEEs under our health and workers\u2019 compensation programs. If we are unable to timely make these changes, incur substantial additional costs in doing so, or are otherwise adversely affected by these requirements, then we may face fines, penalties, other regulatory action, or litigation relating to such failure, which could further adversely impact our PEO state licenses or registrations, our certified PEO status, our results of operations and our ability to attract and retain clients.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic business interruptions and associated economic impact has adversely and disproportionately affected certain industries, including the oil and gas industry. The substantial decrease in the global demand for oil contributed to a significant decline in its commodity price, which has materially and adversely impacted businesses dependent on oil production, including those with operations in Texas. While our oil and gas related customers account for approximately 1% of our customer base, our Texas market accounts for approximately 20% of our revenues. The impact of\nInsperity 21\n2020 Form 10-K\nthe COVID-19 pandemic on oil prices and the resulting impact on regional economies with oil-focused businesses could aggravate our risk factors for clients operating in the oil and gas sector as well as other clients who operate in the Texas market.\nThe impact and evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic precludes any prediction as to its full adverse impact. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to our business, including as a result of the forgoing reasons, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and business.\nGeographic market concentration makes our results of operations vulnerable to regional economic factors.\nOur New York, California and Texas markets accounted for approximately 10%, 15% and 20% (including 8% in Houston), respectively, of our WSEEs for the year ended December 31, 2020. Accordingly, while we have a goal of expanding in our current markets and into new markets, for the foreseeable future, a significant portion of our revenues may be subject to economic, statutory, and regulatory factors specific to New York, California and Texas.\nWe are subject to covenants under our credit facility that may restrict our business and financing activities. Our failure to comply with these covenants may result in an acceleration of our indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur credit facility contains, and any future indebtedness of ours likely would contain, covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restricting our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness,\n\u2022sell material assets,\n\u2022retire, redeem or otherwise reacquire our capital stock,\n\u2022acquire the capital stock or assets of another business,\n\u2022enter into new lines of business,\n\u2022make investments, and\n\u2022pay dividends.\nIn addition, we are required to maintain certain financial covenants. Our ability to comply with the financial covenants may be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors beyond our control.\nOur failure to comply with these covenants, or any other terms of our indebtedness, could result in a default that may limit our ability to borrow additional amounts under our credit facility, which may adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, a default may allow our lenders to accelerate our obligation to repay the outstanding amounts under our credit facility. If we were unable to repay or refinance the accelerated indebtedness on favorable terms, then our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nPEO HR Outsourcing Solutions Risks\nWe assume liability for WSEE payroll, payroll taxes, benefits costs and workers\u2019 compensation costs and are responsible for their payment regardless of the amount billed to or paid by our clients.\nUnder the CSA, we become a co-employer of WSEEs and assume the obligations to pay the salaries, wages and related benefits costs and payroll taxes of such WSEEs. We assume such obligations as a principal, not as an agent of the client. Our obligations include responsibility for:\n\u2022payment of the salaries and wages for work performed by WSEEs, regardless of whether the client timely pays us the associated service fee\n\u2022withholding and payment of federal and state payroll taxes with respect to wages and salaries reported by Insperity\nInsperity 22\n2020 Form 10-K\n\u2022providing benefits to WSEEs even if our costs to provide such benefits exceed the fees the client pays us and the amounts collected from WSEEs\n\u2022providing workers\u2019 compensation coverage to WSEEs\nIf a client does not pay us, or if the costs of benefits we provide to WSEEs exceed the fees a client pays us, our ultimate liability for WSEE payroll and benefits costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreases in health insurance costs or our inability to secure replacement health insurance coverage on competitive terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMaintaining health insurance plans that cover WSEEs is a significant part of our business. Our primary health insurance contract expires on December 31, 2022, subject to cancellation by either party upon 180 days\u2019 notice. In the event we are unable to secure replacement contracts on competitive terms, significant disruption to our business could occur.\nHealth insurance costs are in part determined by our plans\u2019 claims experience and comprise a significant portion of our direct costs. Our health insurance coverage is provided under policies or service contracts that are fully-insured. United is the carrier that insures the majority of our coverage. Although all of our carriers remain responsible to pay all covered claims, under our health insurance contract with United, we retain an obligation to United to fund the cost of the plan. The profitability of our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions is affected by the overall expenses associated with the cost of delivering our services, one of the largest of which is the cost of our health insurance. Our ability to accurately anticipate the expenses associated with the plans, including claims costs on a quarterly or annual basis, can impact our results of operations. If the plans experience an increase in the number or severity of claims, our associated health insurance costs could increase beyond anticipated levels, as we experienced in 2019. These costs are further impacted by a number of factors, including coverage options elected by employees, macro-economic changes, proposed and enacted regulatory changes and wide-spread health-related outbreaks. Contractual arrangements with our clients limit or delay our ability to reflect in our service fees any increases in the overall expense associated with the plans, which could substantially impair our financial condition or results of operations. Further, if the overall pricing of our services includes cost assumptions based on inaccurate forecasts of plan expenses, our profitability or our ability to attract and retain clients may be adversely impacted. As a result, if we do not accurately forecast the costs of our plans, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. For additional information related to our health insurance costs, please read Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Benefits Costs.\u201d\nHealth care reform could affect our health insurance plan and could lead to a significant disruption in our business.\nThe PPACA was signed into law on March 23, 2010. The PPACA was subsequently amended on March 30, 2010 by the Reconciliation Act. The Act entails sweeping health care reforms with original staggered effective dates from 2010 through 2018, some of which were subsequently extended out as far as 2022. Some provisions in the Act still require the issuance of additional guidance from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) and the states.\nBeginning in 2014, a number of key provisions of the Act took effect, including the Exchanges, insurance market reforms and the imposition of excise taxes on the health insurance industry and reinsurance taxes on insurers and third-party administrators. Additionally, the pay or play penalties on Applicable Large Employers were fully phased-in by 2016. As part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, the requirements that individuals maintain health insurance coverage or pay a federal tax penalty, which was known as the individual mandate, was effectively eliminated beginning in 2019. In addition, supporters in various states are advocating for adoption of healthcare-related reforms at the state level, including those states that have enacted individual mandates. Collectively, these items have the potential to significantly change the insurance marketplace for small and medium-sized businesses and how employers provide insurance to employees. Generally, the Act and subsequently issued guidance by the IRS and HHS have not addressed or in some instances are unclear as to their application in the PEO relationship or whether such provisions should be applied at the PEO or client level.\nAlthough we do not believe that the Act has had a material adverse effect on our benefit plans, business model, or operations to date, the elimination of the penalty associated with the individual mandate and subsequent changes resulting from action that may be taken at the federal or state level may impact our benefit plans, business model and future results of\nInsperity 23\n2020 Form 10-K\noperations, including repeal or repeal and replacement of the Act as has been advocated by Congressional leaders or as may result from a case pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. In future periods, changes may result in increased costs to us and could affect our ability to attract and retain clients. Additionally, contractual arrangements and competitive market conditions may limit or delay our ability to increase service fees to offset any associated potential increased costs. For additional information related to the Act, please read Item 1. \u201cBusiness-Industry Regulations-Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\u201d We are currently unable to determine whether potential future changes to the Act or other regulatory action, including at the state level, may adversely affect our business or market conditions.\nIncreases in workers\u2019 compensation costs or inability to secure replacement coverage on competitive terms could lead to a significant disruption to our business.\nOur workers\u2019 compensation coverage has been provided through an arrangement with Chubb (formerly ACE American Insurance Company) since 2007. Under our current arrangement with Chubb for claims incurred on or before September 30, 2019, we have a financial responsibility to Chubb for the first $1 million layer of claims per occurrence and for claims over $1 million, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $6 million per policy year for claims that exceed the first $1 million. Effective for claims incurred on or after October 1, 2019, our financial responsibility increased as we have financial responsibility to Chubb for the first $1.5 million layer of claims per occurrence and for claims over $1.5 million, up to a maximum aggregate amount of $6 million per policy year for claims that exceed $1.5 million. Chubb bears the financial responsibility for all claims in excess of these levels. The Chubb Program is a fully insured program whereby Chubb has the responsibility to pay all claims incurred under the policies regardless of whether we satisfy our responsibilities. For additional discussion of our policy with Chubb, please read Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Workers\u2019 Compensation Costs.\u201d\nWorkers\u2019 compensation costs are a significant portion of our direct costs and contractual arrangements with our clients limit or delay our ability to reflect in our service fees any increases associated with these costs. If we were to experience an unexpected large increase in the number or severity of claims, our workers\u2019 compensation costs could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Further, if the overall pricing of our services includes cost assumptions based on inaccurate forecasts of our workers\u2019 compensation costs, our profitability or our ability to attract and retain clients may be adversely impacted.\nThe current workers\u2019 compensation coverage with Chubb expires on September 30, 2021. In the event we are unable to secure replacement coverage on competitive terms, significant disruption to our business could occur.\nOur ability to adjust and collect service fees for increases in unemployment tax rates may be limited.\nWe record our SUI expense based on taxable wages and tax rates assigned by each state. SUI tax rates vary by state and are determined, in part, based on prior years\u2019 compensation experience in each state. Certain states have indicated that 2021 unemployment tax rates will exclude COVID-19 related unemployment claims; however, the determination of which claims qualify for exclusion and the impact of such a determination on future state unemployment rates has not been clarified. Prior to the receipt of final rate notices, we estimate our expected SUI rate in those states for which rate notices have not yet been received for purposes of budgeting and pricing. In a period of adverse economic conditions, state unemployment funds may experience a significant increase in the number of unemployment claims. Accordingly, SUI rates would likely increase substantially. Some states have the ability under law to increase SUI rates retroactively to cover deficiencies in the unemployment fund. In addition, FUTA may be retroactively increased in certain states in the event the state fails to timely repay federal unemployment loans.\nGenerally, our contractual agreements allow us to incorporate such statutory increases into our service fees upon the effective date of the rate change. However, our ability to fully adjust service fees in our billing systems and collect such increases over the remaining term of the clients\u2019 contracts could be limited, resulting in a potential increase not being fully recovered. As a result, such increases could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nMany of our contracts for our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions may be canceled on short notice. Our inability to renew client contracts or attract new clients could materially and adversely affect our financial conditions or results of operations.\nOur standard CSA can generally be canceled by us or the client with 30 days\u2019 notice. Accordingly, the short-term nature of the CSA makes us vulnerable to potential cancellations by existing PEO HR Outsourcing solution clients, which could\nInsperity 24\n2020 Form 10-K\nmaterially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. During 2020, middle market accounts represented 24.4% of our average paid WSEEs and clients with an average number of WSEEs that exceed 1,000 WSEEs represented 4.7%. In the event we have large clients that terminate or an increase in terminating clients from our middle market client base, the financial impact of such an event could be significant. Also, our results of operations are dependent in part upon our ability to retain or replace our clients upon the termination or cancellation of the CSA. Our client attrition rate was approximately 18% in 2020. There can be no assurance that the number of contract cancellations will continue at these levels and such cancellations may increase in the future due to various factors, including economic conditions in the markets we operate. Clients electing to purchase our services or electing an alternative solution often do so at the beginning of the calendar year. As a result, we typically experience our largest concentration of new client additions and attrition in the first quarter of each year.\nOur loss of insurance coverage, the failure of our insurance carriers or increased insurance costs or deductibles could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAs part of our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions, in addition to our health insurance carriers, we contract with other insurance carriers to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance and employment practices liability insurance. In addition, we obtain insurance coverage for various commercial risks in our business such as property insurance, errors and omissions insurance, cyber liability insurance, general liability insurance, fiduciary liability insurance, automobile liability insurance, and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance. The failure of any insurance carrier, such as occurred in 2001 with respect to a previous workers\u2019 compensation insurance provider, providing such coverage could leave us exposed to uninsured risk and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, in the event that our primary health carriers in any key market make material changes to their network of healthcare providers or facilities, such as the recent temporary discontinuation of a prominent hospital network in Houston, Texas, by UnitedHealthcare in connection with their ongoing negotiations, then our ability to attract and retain clients in that market may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, we have experienced an increase in insurance premiums for our corporate policies as well as an increase in the deductible amounts for which we retain liability and a decrease in coverage limits. If these premiums or deductible amounts continue to increase, or coverage limits continue to decrease we would have increased exposure with respect to costs and insurance claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA determination that a client is liable for employment taxes not paid by a PEO may discourage clients from contracting with us in the future.\nUnder the CSA, we assume sole responsibility and liability for paying federal employment taxes imposed under the Code with respect to wages and salaries we pay our WSEEs. There are essentially three types of federal employment tax obligations:\n\u2022income tax withholding requirements\n\u2022FICA\n\u2022FUTA\nUnder the Code, employers have the obligation to withhold and remit the employer portion and, where applicable, the employee portion of these taxes. The SBEA clarifies that a CPEO is treated as the employer for purposes of federal payroll taxes on wages it pays to WSEEs. Most states impose similar employment tax obligations on the employer. While the CSA provides that we have sole legal responsibility for making these tax contributions, the applicable state taxing authority could conclude that such liability cannot be completely transferred to us. Accordingly, in the event that we fail to meet our tax withholding and payment obligations, the client may be held jointly and severally liable for those obligations. While this interpretive issue has not, to our knowledge, discouraged clients from enrolling with Insperity, a definitive adverse resolution of this issue may discourage clients from enrolling in the future.\nNew and higher federal, state and local taxes could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn times of economic slowdowns, the federal government and states and municipalities in which we operate may experience reductions in tax revenues and corresponding budget deficits. In response to budget shortfalls, such as those being experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government and many states and municipalities have in the\nInsperity 25\n2020 Form 10-K\npast and may in the future increase or enact new taxes on businesses operating within their tax jurisdiction, including business activity taxes and income taxes. In addition, federal, state and local taxing agencies may increase their audit activity in an effort to identify additional tax revenues. New tax assessments on our operations could result in increased costs. Further, the Biden Administration and Congressional leaders have expressed support for reviewing federal taxes and potential increases in federal tax rates for businesses. Our ability to adjust our service fees and incorporate additional tax assessments into our billing system could be limited. As a result, such higher taxes could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to liabilities for client and employee actions.\nAs a co-employer in the PEO relationship, we assume or share many of the employer-related responsibilities and assist our clients in complying with many employment-related governmental regulations. A number of legal issues remain unresolved with respect to the co-employment arrangement between a PEO and its WSEEs, including questions concerning the ultimate liability for violations of employment, payroll, discrimination, and workplace safety laws. Our CSA establishes the contractual division of responsibilities between Insperity and our clients for various personnel management matters, including compliance with and liability under various governmental regulations.\nBecause we act as a co-employer, we may be subject to liability for violations of various employment, payroll, discrimination, and workplace safety laws despite these contractual provisions, even if we do not participate in such violations. Although the CSA generally requires the client to indemnify us for certain liabilities attributable to the client\u2019s conduct, we may not be able to collect on such a contractual indemnification claim and thus may be responsible for satisfying such liabilities to the extent that such liabilities are not covered or insured against under our insurance policies. In addition, WSEEs may be deemed to be our agents, which may subject us to liability for the actions of such WSEEs.\nChanges in federal, state and local regulation or our inability to obtain licenses under new regulatory frameworks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nAs a major employer, our operations are affected by numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to labor, tax, benefit, insurance and employment matters. By entering into a co-employer relationship with employees assigned to work at client locations, we assume certain obligations and responsibilities of an employer under these laws. However, many of these current laws (such as the Act, ERISA and federal and state employment tax laws) do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of non-traditional employers such as PEOs, and the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d under these laws is not uniform despite the SBEA having provided clarification under federal employment tax laws for CPEOs. In addition, many of the states in which we operate have not addressed the PEO relationship for purposes of compliance with applicable state laws governing the employer/employee relationship or PEO health insurance plans. Any adverse application of, or adverse legislative/regulatory response to, new or existing federal or state laws to the PEO relationship with our WSEEs and client companies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWhile some states do not explicitly regulate PEOs, 42 states have passed laws that have recognition, licensing, certification or registration requirements for PEOs and several other states are considering such regulation. Such laws vary from state to state, but generally provide for monitoring the fiscal responsibility of PEOs, and in some cases codify and clarify the co-employment relationship for unemployment, workers\u2019 compensation and other purposes under state law. In addition, the SBEA provides certain benefits for companies that qualify as a CPEO. While we generally support licensing regulation because it serves to validate the PEO relationship, we may not be able to satisfy licensing requirements or other applicable regulations for all states. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our licenses in all states or that we will be able to maintain our CPEO designation.\nCertain state and federal regulators are more closely evaluating the existing regulatory framework governing money services businesses and money transmitters in their jurisdictions, particularly following the high-profile failures in 2019 of several national payroll companies. While we maintain that we are not a money services business or money transmitter, the adoption of new, or changes in interpretations of existing, state and federal money transmitter or money services business statutes, or disagreements by regulatory authorities with our interpretation of such statutes or regulations, could subject us to registration or licensing or result in limitations on our business activities until we are appropriately licensed, and such additional regulation and the actions of the regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. These occurrences could also require changes to the manner in which we conduct some aspects of our business. In addition, should any state or federal regulators make a determination that we have operated as an unlicensed money services business or money transmitter, we could be subject to civil and criminal fines, penalties, costs, legal fees, reputational damage or other negative consequences, which could be material.\nInsperity 26\n2020 Form 10-K\nCompetition and other developments in the HR services industry may impact our growth and/or profitability.\nThe human resources services industry, including the PEO industry, is highly fragmented. Many PEOs have limited operations and fewer than 1,000 WSEEs, but there are several industry participants that are comparable to our size or larger. We also encounter competition from \u201cfee for service\u201d companies such as payroll processing firms, insurance companies, human resources consultants and human resources technology solutions as well as cloud-based self-service bundled human resources offerings. Our competitors include the PEO divisions of large business services companies, such as Automatic Data Processing, Inc. and Paychex, Inc., and other national PEOs such as TriNet Group, Inc. In many cases, these competitors offer a reduced service PEO offering at a lower price than our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions. We expect that as the PEO industry grows and its regulatory framework becomes better established, well organized competition with greater resources than we have may enter the PEO market, possibly including large \u201cfee for service\u201d companies currently providing a more limited range of services. In addition, competitors may be able to offer or develop new technology-based lower service models that may require us to make substantial investments in order to effectively compete.\nWe offer a lower priced reduced service level PEO offering referred to as Workforce Synchronization in response to certain middle market client needs and the evolving PEO marketplace. As of December 2020, approximately 13% of our WSEEs were co-employed by Workforce Synchronization clients. In the event we were to experience a significant increase in the number of clients using the Workforce Synchronization offering or increased pricing pressures in the PEO marketplace without corresponding reductions in operating costs, our operating margins may decline, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nTechnology Risks\nEvolving regulations, market trends and client expectations require us to constantly enhance and expand our service and technology offerings.\nThe HR services industry is experiencing rapid technological advances to meet client expectations and expanding regulations. As new regulations are adopted, we must modify our systems to address these changes in the law, such as our recent efforts to implement the assistance provided to businesses and employees under the FFCRA and CARES Act. In order to make these types of modifications, we may be required to reallocate resources, potentially resulting in delays to planned competitive improvements to our systems. If we do not successfully or timely deploy these types of modifications, we may be unable to comply with regulations, which could subject us to penalties, damage our reputation or result in decreased sales. Further, in order to effectively compete in this environment, we must identify and predict trends, and adapt our technology and service offerings accordingly. In addition, as a larger portion of our client base falls within the middle market segment, we must also develop different technology and services to meet the more complex needs and demands of this key group. These efforts require us to devote substantial resources to develop new functionality, or to integrate third-party solutions, into our offerings. If we fail to respond successfully to these developments or we may make investments in enhancements that are not accepted by the market, then the demand for our solutions and services may diminish.\nDisruptions of our information technology systems could damage our reputation and materially disrupt our business operations.\nMany of the HR services offerings we provide to clients are conducted through a technology infrastructure using both internally developed and purchased commercial software, a wide variety of hardware infrastructure technologies, and a multi-carrier wide area network. The processing of payroll, benefits and other transactions is dependent upon this complex infrastructure, some of which is provided by third-party vendors. We must manage all of these systems, including any upgrades, replacements or enhancements, to ensure that they continue to support our services. For example, we are currently finalizing a modernization of key portions of our proprietary system for our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions as well as commencing a project to replace our customer relationship management (CRM) system. Any delays or failures resulting from network outages; planned upgrades, enhancements, or replacements of software, hardware, or other systems, including in connection with our PEO Outsourcing solutions modernization project or our CRM replacement project; or other data processing disruptions, even for a brief period of time, could result in our inability to timely process transactions. If such failures cause us to not meet client service expectations or to breach our obligations to our clients, we may lose existing clients, have difficulty attracting new clients, incur regulatory penalties or liability to our clients, or suffer other financial losses, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nInsperity 27\n2020 Form 10-K\nWe could be subject to reduced revenues, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our competitive position as a result of data theft, cyberattacks or other security vulnerabilities.\nIn connection with our HR services offerings, we collect, use, transmit and store large amounts of personal and business information about our WSEEs and clients, including payroll information, personal and business financial data, social security numbers, bank account numbers, tax information and other sensitive personal and business information. Attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency and sophistication, and we and our third-party vendors are targeted by unauthorized parties using malicious tactics, code and viruses. Hardware or applications we develop or procure from third-party vendors may contain defects in design or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of data or our systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access and disable or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we and our third-party vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. As these threats continue to evolve, we may be required to invest significant additional resources to modify and enhance our information security and controls or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. While our technology infrastructure is designed to safeguard and protect personal and business information, we have limited ability to monitor the implementation of similar safeguards by our vendors and do not have the ability to monitor such implementation by our clients or WSEEs.\nIn addition, our services also involve the use and disclosure of personal and business information to us that could be used by a malicious party to commit identity theft or otherwise gain access to the data or funds of our clients or WSEEs. If any person, including any corporate employee, misappropriates or misuses such funds, documents or data, we may have liability for damages, and our reputation could be substantially harmed and we may have other liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAny cyberattack, unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, corruption of data, or theft of private or other sensitive information, or inadvertent or malicious acts by our own employees, could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, and could have a material adverse effect on our business operations or that of our clients, result in liability or regulatory sanction, or cause a loss of confidence in our ability to serve clients. We may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate us for losses from a security incident. Accordingly, the impact of a data security incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with privacy, data protection and cybersecurity laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use, transmission and security and privacy of personal and business information. Most states and the District of Columbia have enacted notification rules that may require notification to regulators, clients or employees in the event of a privacy breach. In addition, new laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potentially elevate our costs. It is possible that these federal and state laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. For example, we incurred additional costs and reallocated internal resources in order to comply with the requirements of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which became effective on January 1, 2020, and we expect to incur additional costs and reallocate additional resources when the final regulations under the CCPA are released. Other states are currently contemplating additional privacy requirements. The future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations could have a material adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant liability. Additionally, any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a security or privacy breach, could result in significant penalties and liabilities for us.\nThe failure of third-party providers, such as financial institutions, data centers or cloud-service providers, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn conjunction with providing services to clients, we communicate and rely on financial institutions to electronically transfer funds for the collection of our comprehensive service fee as well as the payment of wages and associated payroll tax withholdings. Communication failures or other failures involving these financial institutions, for any reason, could cause material interruptions to our operations, impact client retention, and result in significant penalties or liabilities to us.\nInsperity 28\n2020 Form 10-K\nWe lease hosting facilities for our data centers at two separate facilities, located in Bryan, Texas and The Woodlands, Texas, with the Bryan facility acting as our primary data center. These facilities host the majority of our business applications, telecommunications equipment, information security infrastructure and network equipment. If our data centers experience any interruptions or outages, and our business continuity plan fails, then our operations may be materially impacted, which could result in our failure to meet our obligations to our clients, WSEEs and tax authorities, and could damage our reputation, subject us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, some of our systems and services rely upon third-party technology, such as the human capital management system on which our Workforce Acceleration solution is based, the data analytics solution on which our Insperity People Analytics solution is based, and the payroll tax calculation tool that provides the rates used to calculate payroll taxes for our PEO HR Outsourcing solutions. Any failure by these service providers to deliver their services in a timely manner and in compliance with applicable laws could result in material interruptions to our operations, damage our reputation, and result in a loss of clients.\nOther Operational Risks\nFailure to integrate or realize the expected return on our acquisitions and investments could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have adopted a strategy to market and sell additional products and services within and outside of traditional PEO HR Outsourcing solutions. As part of this strategy, periodically we make strategic long-term decisions to invest in and/or acquire new companies, business units or assets. Acquiring new businesses involves a number of risks such as over-valuation of the acquired companies, entering markets or businesses in which we have no prior experience, integrating the technology, operations, and personnel, diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and litigation resulting from the activities of the acquired company. The occurrence of one or more of these events could result in the loss of existing or prospective clients or employees, not achieving anticipated revenues or profitability, or impairment of acquired assets. Such developments could have a material impact to our financial condition, results of operations and future growth rates. Based on market conditions or changes in operating plans, the fair value of our other acquired businesses or investments could decline, requiring us to record impairment charges for all or portions of the investments.\nInsperity 29\n2020 Form 10-K", "PERMNO": 84385, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "NSP"}
