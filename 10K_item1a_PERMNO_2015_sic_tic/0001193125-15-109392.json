RISK FACTORS.\nThe following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements in this annual report on Form 10-K. See \u201cDisclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIntense competition in the apparel and fashion industry could reduce our sales and profitability.\nAs a fashion company, we face intense competition from other domestic and foreign apparel, footwear and accessories manufacturers and retailers. Competition may result in pricing pressures, reduced profit margins, lost market share or failure to grow our market share, any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations. Competition is based on many factors including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022\nestablishing and maintaining favorable brand recognition;\n\u2022\ndeveloping products that appeal to consumers;\n\u2022\npricing products appropriately;\n\u2022\ndetermining and maintaining product quality;\n\u2022\nobtaining access to sufficient floor space in retail locations;\n\u2022\nproviding appropriate services and support to retailers;\n\u2022\nmaintaining and growing market share;\n\u2022\nhiring and retaining key employees; and\n\u2022\nprotecting intellectual property.\nCompetition in the apparel and fashion industry is intense and is dominated by a number of very large brands, many of which have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more established relationships with a broader set of suppliers, greater brand recognition and greater financial, research and development, marketing, distribution and other resources than we do. These capabilities of our competitors may allow them to better withstand downturns in the economy or apparel and fashion industry. Any increased competition, or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors, could result in reduced sales, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nCompetition, along with such other factors as consolidation within the retail industry and changes in consumer spending patterns, could also result in significant pricing pressure and cause the sales environment to be more promotional, as it was in 2014. If promotional pressure remains intense, either through actions of our competitors or through customer expectations, this may cause us to reduce our sales prices to our wholesale partners and retail consumers, which could cause our gross margins to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels and/or otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. If our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our profitability may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nGeneral economic conditions in the U.S. and other parts of the world, including a continued weakening of the economy and restricted credit markets, can affect consumer confidence and consumer spending patterns.\nThe apparel industry has historically been subject to cyclical variations, recessions in the general economy or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect consumer spending habits which could negatively impact our business overall, the carrying value of our tangible and intangible assets and specifically sales, gross margins and profitability. The success of our operations depends on consumer spending. Consumer spending is impacted by a number of factors, including actual and perceived economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income (such as unemployment, wages, energy costs and consumer debt levels), business conditions, interest rates and availability of credit and tax rates in the general economy and in the international, regional and local markets in which our products are sold.\nRecent global economic conditions have included significant recessionary pressures and declines in employment levels, disposable income and actual and/or perceived wealth and further declines in consumer confidence and economic growth. The recent depressed economic environment was characterized by a decline in consumer discretionary spending and has disproportionately affected retailers and sellers of consumer goods, particularly those whose goods are viewed as discretionary or luxury purchases, including fashion apparel and accessories such as ours. During such recessionary periods, we may have to increase the number of promotional sales or otherwise dispose of inventory which we have previously paid to manufacture. While we have seen occasional signs of stabilization in the North American markets during 2013 and 2014, the recent recession may have resulted in a shift in consumer spending habits that makes it unlikely that spending will return to prior levels for the foreseeable future as the promotional environment has continued and may continue going forward. Such factors as well as another shift towards recessionary conditions could adversely impact our sales volumes and overall profitability in the future.\nFurther, growing concerns that European countries could default on their national debt have caused instability in the European economy, which is one of the areas that we are currently targeting for international expansion. Continued economic and political volatility and declines in the value of the Euro or other foreign\ncurrencies could negatively impact the global economy as a whole and have a material adverse effect on the profitability and liquidity of our international operations, as well as hinder our ability to grow through expansion in the international markets. In addition, domestic and international political situations also affect consumer confidence. The threat, outbreak or escalation of terrorism, military conflicts or other hostilities around the world could lead to decreases in consumer spending.\nOur business depends on a strong brand image, and if we are not able to maintain or enhance our brand, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition, we may be unable to sell sufficient quantities of our merchandise, which would harm our business and cause our results of operations to suffer.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing the Vince brand is critical to maintaining and expanding our customer base. Maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as visual merchandising (including working with our wholesale partners to transform select Vince displays into branded shop-in-shops), marketing and advertising, employee training and store operations. A primary component of our strategy involves expanding into other geographic markets and working with existing wholesale partners, particularly within the U.S. We anticipate that, as our business expands into new markets and further penetrates existing markets, and as the markets in which we operate become increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Certain of our competitors in the fashion industry have faced adverse publicity surrounding the quality, attributes and performance of their products. Our brand may similarly be adversely affected if our public image or reputation is tarnished by failing to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and integrity. Any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a leader in the contemporary fashion industry and to continue to provide high quality products. If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brand image, our results of operations may suffer and our business may be harmed.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of large wholesale partners, and the loss of any of these wholesale partners could substantially reduce our total revenue.\nWe have a small number of wholesale partners who account for a significant portion of our net sales. Net sales to the full-price, off-price and e-commerce operations of our three largest wholesale partners were 49% of our total revenue for fiscal 2014. These partners include Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, each accounting for more than 10% of our total revenue for fiscal 2014. We do not have written agreements with any of our wholesale partners, and purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis. A decision by any of our major wholesale partners, whether motivated by marketing strategy, competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to significantly decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners, or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners, could substantially reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Furthermore, due to the concentration of our wholesale partner base, our results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these wholesale partners fails to satisfy its payment obligations to us when due. During the past several years, the retail industry has experienced a great deal of ownership change, and we expect such change will continue. In addition, store closings by our wholesale partners decrease the number of stores carrying our products, while the remaining stores may purchase a smaller amount of our products and may reduce the retail floor space designated for our brand. In the future, retailers may further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations, realign their affiliations or reposition their stores\u2019 target markets. Any of these types of actions could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry. These changes could decrease our opportunities in the market, increase our reliance on a diminishing number of large wholesale partners and decrease our negotiating strength with our wholesale partners. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not be able to successfully expand our wholesale partnership base or grow our presence with existing wholesale partners.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to increase productivity and penetration with existing wholesale partners and form relationships with new, international wholesale partners. These initiatives may include the establishment of additional shop-in-shops within select department stores. The location of Vince displays or shop-in-shops within department stores is controlled in large part by our wholesale partners. Although the investments made by us and our wholesale partners in the development and installation of Vince displays and shop-in-shops decreases the risk that our wholesale partners will require us to move to a less desirable area of their store or reduce the space allocated to such displays and shops, they are not contractually prohibited from doing so or required to grant additional or more desirable space to us. While expanding the number of shop-in-shops is part of our growth strategy, there can be no assurances we will be able to align our wholesale partners with this strategy and continue to receive floor space from our wholesale partners to open or expand shop-in-shops.\nOur ability to attract customers to our stores depends heavily on successfully locating our stores in suitable locations and any impairment of a store location, including any decrease in customer traffic, could cause our sales to be less than expected.\nOur approach to identifying locations for our retail stores typically favors street and mall locations near luxury and contemporary retailers that we believe are consistent with our key customers\u2019 demographics and shopping preferences. Sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the volume of foot traffic in these locations. Changes in areas around our existing retail locations that result in reductions in customer foot traffic or otherwise render the locations unsuitable could cause our sales to be less than expected and the related leases are generally non-cancelable. Store locations may become unsuitable due to, and our sales volume and customer traffic generally may be harmed by, among other things:\n\u2022\neconomic downturns in a particular area;\n\u2022\ncompetition from nearby retailers selling similar apparel or accessories;\n\u2022\nchanging consumer demographics in a particular market;\n\u2022\nchanging preferences of consumers in a particular market;\n\u2022\nthe closing or decline in popularity of other businesses located near our stores; and\n\u2022\nstore impairments due to acts of God or terrorism.\nOur ability to successfully open and operate new retail stores depends on many factors, including, among others, our ability to:\n\u2022\nidentify new markets where our products and brand image will be accepted or the performance of our retail stores will be successful;\n\u2022\nobtain desired locations, including store size and adjacencies, in targeted malls or streets;\n\u2022\nnegotiate acceptable lease terms, including desired rent and tenant improvement allowances, to secure suitable store locations;\n\u2022\nachieve brand awareness, affinity and purchase intent in the new markets;\n\u2022\nhire, train and retain store associates and field management;\n\u2022\nassimilate new store associates and field management into our corporate culture;\n\u2022\nsource and supply sufficient inventory levels; and\n\u2022\nsuccessfully integrate new retail stores into our existing operations and information technology systems, which will initially be provided by Kellwood under the terms of the Shared Services Agreement.\nAs of January 31, 2015, we had 37 stores, which consisted of 28 full-price retail stores and nine outlet locations. We plan to increase our store base over the next three to five years, including the expected openings of eight to 10 new stores in fiscal 2015. Our new stores, however, may not be immediately profitable and we may incur losses until these stores become profitable. Unavailability of desired store locations, delays in the acquisition or opening of new stores, delays or costs resulting from a decrease in commercial development due to capital restraints, difficulties in staffing and operating new store locations or a lack of customer acceptance of stores in new market areas may negatively impact our new store growth and the costs or the profitability associated with new stores. There can be no assurance that we will open the planned number of stores in fiscal 2015 or thereafter. Any failure to successfully open and operate new stores may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs we expand our store base, we may be unable to maintain or grow comparable store sales or average sales per square foot at the same rates that we have achieved in the past, which could cause our share price to decline.\nAs we expand our store base, we may not be able to maintain or grow at the same rates of comparable store sales growth that we have achieved historically. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or grow our historic average sales per square foot as we move into new markets. If our future comparable store sales or average sales per square foot decline or fail to meet market expectations, the price of our common stock could decline. In addition, the aggregate results of operations through our wholesale partners and at our retail locations have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. A variety of factors affect both comparable store sales and average sales per square foot, including, among others, consumer spending patterns, fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our product assortment, the success of marketing programs and weather conditions. If we misjudge the market for our products, we may incur excess inventory for some of our products and miss opportunities for other products. These factors may cause our comparable store sales results and average sales per square foot in the future to be materially lower than recent periods or our expectations, which could harm our results of operations and result in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nWe have grown rapidly in recent years and we have limited operating experience as a team at our current scale of operations. If we are unable to manage our operations at our current size or are unable to manage any future growth effectively, our business results and financial performance may suffer.\nWe have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception in 2002, and we have limited operating experience at our current size. Our business has grown significantly over the past three years, as we have grown our total net sales from $240.4 million in fiscal 2012 to $340.4 million in fiscal 2014. We have made and are making investments to support our near and longer-term growth. If our operations continue to grow over the longer term, of which there can be no assurance, we will be required to expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes, and to obtain more space for our expanding administrative support and other headquarters personnel. Our expansion may exceed the capacity that Kellwood is able to provide, on attractive pricing terms or at all, under the terms of the Shared Services Agreement (as more fully described below in \u201c-Problems with our distribution system could harm our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve targeted operating efficiencies\u201d). Our continued growth could strain our existing resources, and we could experience operating difficulties, including obtaining sufficient raw materials at acceptable prices, securing manufacturing capacity to produce our products and experiencing delays in production and shipments. These difficulties would likely lead to a decrease in net revenue, income from operations and the price of our common stock.\nKellwood provides us with certain key services for our business, some of which we are in the process of transitioning to our own systems. If Kellwood fails to perform its obligations to us during the period of transition or if we cannot successfully transition these services to our own systems, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially harmed.\nPrior to the IPO and Restructuring Transactions that closed on November 27, 2013, we operated as a business unit of Kellwood, and we historically relied on the financial resources and the administrative and operational support systems of Kellwood to run our business. Some of the Kellwood systems we continue to use following the IPO and Restructuring Transactions include ERP, human resource management systems and distribution applications. In conjunction with our separation from Kellwood, we are in the process of separating our assets from those of Kellwood. We have recently commenced the development and implementation of our own ERP system and IT infrastructure, engaged with a new e-commerce platform provider and migrated the human resource recruitment system. The new systems we implement may not operate as successfully as the systems we historically used as such systems are highly customized or proprietary. Moreover, we may be unable to obtain necessary goods, technology and services to continue replacing the Kellwood systems at prices and on terms as favorable as those available to us prior to the separation, which could increase our costs and reduce our profitability. If we fail to successfully transition the systems, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe entered into a Shared Services Agreement in connection with the IPO and Restructuring Transactions on November 27, 2013. The Shared Services Agreement governs the provisions by which Kellwood provides certain support services to us, including distribution, information technology and back office support. Kellwood will provide these services until we elect to terminate the provision thereof in accordance with the terms of such agreement or, for services which require a term as a matter of law or which are based on a third-party agreement with a set term, the related termination date specified in the schedule thereto. Upon the termination of certain services, Kellwood may no longer be in a position to provide certain other related services. Assuming we proceed with our request to terminate the original services, such related services shall also be terminated in connection with such termination. The Shared Services Agreement will terminate automatically upon the termination of all services provided thereunder, unless earlier terminated by either party in connection with the other party\u2019s material breach upon 30 days prior notice to such defaulting party. After termination of the agreement, Kellwood will have no obligation to provide any services to us. See \u201cShared Services Agreement\u201d under Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10-K for a description of these services. The services provided under the Shared Services Agreement (as may be amended from time to time) may not be sufficient to meet our needs and we may not be able to replace these services at favorable costs and on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, Kellwood has experienced financial difficulty in the past. For example, in 2009, Kellwood\u2019s independent auditors raised substantial doubt regarding Kellwood\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If Kellwood encounters any issues during the transitional period which impact its ability to provide services pursuant to the Shared Services Agreement, our business could be materially harmed. Any failure or significant downtime in our own financial or administrative systems or in Kellwood\u2019s financial or administrative systems during the transitional period and any difficulty in separating our assets from Kellwood\u2019s assets and integrating newly acquired assets into our business could result in unexpected costs, impact our results or prevent us from paying our suppliers and employees and performing other administrative services on a timely basis and materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSystem security risk issues could disrupt our internal operations or information technology services, and any such disruption could negatively impact our net sales, increase our expenses and harm our reputation.\nExperienced computer programmers and hackers, and even internal users, may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties, including our customers, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. In addition, employee error, malfeasance or other errors in the storage, use or transmission of any such information could result in a disclosure to third parties outside of our network. As a result, we could incur significant expenses addressing problems created by any such\ninadvertent disclosure or any security breaches of our network. This risk is heightened because we collect and store customer information, including credit card information, and use certain customer information for our marketing purposes. In addition, we rely on third parties for the operation of our website, www.vince.com, and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy.\nConsumers are increasingly concerned over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet, consumer identity theft and user privacy, and any compromise of customer information could subject us to customer or government litigation and harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and growth. Moreover, we could incur significant expenses or disruptions of our operations in connection with system failures or breaches. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we procure form third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our systems. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate security problems, viruses and bugs, or any problems associated with the outsourced services could be significant, and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service that may impede our sales, distribution or other critical functions. In addition to taking the necessary precautions ourselves, we require that third-party service providers implement reasonable security measures to protect our customers\u2019 identity and privacy. We do not, however, control these third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future. Finally, we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of state, federal and foreign laws regarding the use and unauthorized disclosure of personal information, to the extent they are applicable.\nAny disputes that arise between us and Kellwood with respect to our past and ongoing relationships could harm our business operations.\nDisputes may arise between Kellwood and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships, including:\n\u2022\nintellectual property and technology matters;\n\u2022\nlabor, tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters arising from our separation from Kellwood;\n\u2022\nemployee retention and recruiting;\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations involving us;\n\u2022\nthe nature, quality and pricing of transitional services Kellwood has agreed to provide us; and\n\u2022\nbusiness opportunities that may be attractive to both Kellwood and us.\nWe may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party. As of January 31, 2015, affiliates of Sun Capital, who also control Kellwood, owned approximately 55% of our common stock. Additionally, Sun Cardinal, LLC, an affiliate of Sun Capital, has the ability to designate a majority of our directors.\nOur limited operating experience and brand recognition in international markets may delay our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer.\nWe face additional risks with respect to our strategy to expand internationally, including our efforts to further expand our business in Canada, select European countries, Asia and the Middle East through arrangements with international partners. Our current operations are based largely in the U.S., with international sales representing approximately 9% of net sales for fiscal 2014. Therefore we have a limited number of customers and experience in operating outside of the U.S. We also do not have extensive experience with regulatory environments and market practices outside of the U.S. and cannot guarantee, notwithstanding our international partners\u2019 familiarity with such environments and market practices, that we will be able to penetrate or successfully operate in any market outside of the U.S. Many of these markets have different operational\ncharacteristics, including employment and labor regulations, transportation, logistics, real estate (including lease terms) and local reporting or legal requirements. Furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as style preferences, size and fit, and purchasing trends, may differ in these markets and, as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those that we currently anticipate. In addition, in many of these markets there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. Failure to develop new markets outside of the U.S. or disappointing sales growth outside of the U.S. may harm our business and results of operations.\nOur plans to improve and expand our product offerings may not be successful, and the implementation of these plans may divert our operational, managerial and administrative resources, which could harm our competitive position and reduce our net revenue and profitability.\nIn addition to our store expansion strategy, we plan to grow our business by increasing our core product offerings, which includes expanding our men\u2019s collection and women\u2019s bottoms, dresses and outerwear assortment. We also plan to develop and introduce select new product categories and may pursue select additional licensing opportunities such as eyewear, fragrance and fashion accessories.\nThe principal risks to our ability to successfully carry out our plans to improve and expand our product offerings are that:\n\u2022\nif our expected product offerings fail to maintain and enhance our brand identity, our image may be diminished or diluted and our sales may decrease;\n\u2022\nif we fail to find and enter into relationships with external partners with the necessary specialized expertise or execution capabilities, we may be unable to offer our planned product extensions or to realize the additional revenue we have targeted for those extensions; and\n\u2022\nthe use of licensing partners may limit our ability to conduct comprehensive final quality checks on merchandise before it is shipped to our stores or to our wholesale partners.\nIn addition, our ability to successfully carry out our plans to improve and expand our product offerings may be affected by economic and competitive conditions, changes in consumer spending patterns and changes in consumer preferences and style trends. These plans could be abandoned, could cost more than anticipated and could divert resources from other areas of our business, any of which could impact our competitive position and reduce our net revenue and profitability.\nOur current and future licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited control.\nWe currently have licensing agreements for women\u2019s footwear, men\u2019s footwear and children\u2019s apparel. In the future, we may enter into select additional licensing arrangements for product offerings which require specialized expertise. We may also enter into select licensing agreements pursuant to which we may grant third parties the right to distribute and sell our products in certain geographic areas. Although we have taken and will continue to take steps to select potential licensing partners carefully and monitor the activities of our licensing partners (through, among other things, approval rights over product design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, marketing, distribution and advertising), such arrangements may not be successful. Our licensing partners may fail to fulfill their obligations under their license agreements or have interests that differ from or conflict with our own, such as the pricing of our products and the offering of competitive products. In addition, the risks applicable to the business of our licensing partners may be different than the risks applicable to our business, including risks associated with each such partner\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\nobtain capital;\n\u2022\nexercise operational and financial control over its business;\n\u2022\nmanage its labor relations;\n\u2022\nmaintain relationships with suppliers;\n\u2022\nmanage its credit and bankruptcy risks; and\n\u2022\nmaintain customer relationships.\nAny of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our licensing partners to successfully market our products or otherwise conduct its business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in regions or product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements.\nOur business will suffer if we fail to respond to changing customer tastes.\nCustomer tastes can change rapidly. We may not be able to anticipate, gauge or respond to these changes within a timely manner. We may also not be able to continue to satisfy our customers\u2019 existing tastes and preferences. If we misjudge the market for products or product groups, or if we fail to identify and respond appropriately to changing consumer demands, we may be faced with unsold finished goods inventory, which could materially adversely affect expected operating results and decrease sales, gross margins and profitability.\nIf we are unable to accurately forecast customer demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to deliver products to meet our requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of products to our stores and to wholesale partners.\nWe stock our stores, and provide inventory to our wholesale partners, based on our or their estimates of future demand for particular products. Our inventory management and planning team determines the number of pieces of each product that we will order from our manufacturers based upon past sales of similar products, sales trend information and anticipated demand at our suggested retail prices. However, if our inventory and planning team fails to accurately forecast customer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage our inventory at a level appropriate for future customer demand.\nFactors that could affect our inventory management and planning team\u2019s ability to accurately forecast customer demand for our products include:\n\u2022\na substantial increase or decrease in demand for our products or for products of our competitors;\n\u2022\nour failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance for our new products;\n\u2022\nnew product introductions or pricing strategies by competitors;\n\u2022\nmore limited historical store sales information for our newer markets;\n\u2022\nweakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in the future, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products; and\n\u2022\nacts or threats of war or terrorism which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of our products and our raw materials.\nBecause of our rapid growth, we have occasionally placed insufficient levels of desirable product with our wholesale partners and in our retail locations such that we were unable to fully satisfy customer demand at those locations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to match supply with demand in all cases in the future, whether as a result of our inability to produce sufficient levels of desirable product or our failure to forecast demand accurately. As a result of these inabilities or failures, we may encounter difficulties in filling customer orders or in liquidating excess inventory at discount prices and may experience significant write-offs. Additionally, if we over-produce a product based on an aggressive forecast of demand, retailers may not be able to sell the product and cancel future orders or require give backs. These outcomes could have a material adverse effect on brand image and adversely impact sales, gross margins and profitability.\nOur senior management team has limited experience working together as a group, and may not be able to manage our business effectively.\nOur CEO, Jill Granoff, and CFO, Lisa Klinger, joined the company in 2012. Many of the other members of our senior management team, including our President and Chief Creative Officer, Karin Gregersen, have been with us less than 2 years. As a result, our senior management team has limited experience working together as a group. This lack of shared experience could negatively impact our senior management team\u2019s ability to quickly and efficiently respond to problems and effectively manage our business. If our management team is not able to work together as a group, our results of operations may suffer and our business may be harmed.\nIf we lose key personnel, or are unable to attract, assimilate and retain new employees, we may not be able to successfully operate or grow our business.\nOur continued success is dependent on the ability to attract, assimilate, retain and motivate qualified management, designers, administrative talent and sales associates to support existing operations and future growth. Competition for qualified talent in the apparel and fashion industry is intense, and we compete for these individuals with other companies that in many cases have greater financial and other resources. The loss of the services of any members of senior management or the inability to attract and retain other qualified executives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we will need to continue to attract, assimilate, retain and motivate highly talented employees with a range of other skills and experience, especially at the store management levels. Although we have hired and trained new store managers and experienced sales associates at several of our retail locations, competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may from time to time experience difficulty in retaining our associates or attracting the additional talent necessary to support the growth of our business. These problems could be exacerbated as we embark on our strategy of opening new retail stores over the next several years. We will also need to attract, assimilate and retain other professionals across a range of disciplines, including design, production, sourcing and international business, as we develop new product categories and continue to expand our international presence. Furthermore, we will need to continue to recruit employees to provide, or enter into consulting or outsourcing arrangements with respect to the provision of, services provided by Kellwood under the Shared Services Agreement when Kellwood no longer provides such services thereunder. If we are unable to attract, assimilate and retain additional employees with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business.\nOur competitive position could suffer if our intellectual property rights are not protected.\nWe believe that our trademarks and designs are of great value. From time to time, third parties have challenged, and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our intellectual property. In some cases, third parties with similar trademarks or other intellectual property may have pre-existing and potentially conflicting trademark registrations. We rely on cooperation from third parties with similar trademarks to be able to register our trademarks in jurisdictions in which such third parties have already registered their trademarks. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing our intellectual property rights. Imitation or counterfeiting of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands or otherwise adversely affect our revenues. The actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others. In addition, others may assert rights in, or ownership of, our trademarks and other intellectual property rights or in similar marks or marks that we license and/or market and we may not be able to successfully resolve these conflicts to our satisfaction. We may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling some of our products. In addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights from third parties or cease using those rights altogether. Any of these events could harm our business and cause our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition to suffer.\nWe license our website domain name from a third-party. Pursuant to the license agreement (the \u201cDomain License Agreement\u201d), our license to use www.vince.com will expire in 2018 and will automatically renew for successive one year periods, subject to our right to terminate the arrangement with or without cause; provided, that we must pay the applicable early termination fee and provide 30 days prior notice in connection with a termination without cause. The licensor has no termination rights under the Domain License Agreement. Any failure by the licensor to perform its obligations under the License Agreement could adversely affect our brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website.\nProblems with our distribution system could harm our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve targeted operating efficiencies.\nIn the U.S., we rely on a distribution facility operated by Kellwood in City of Industry, California. Our ability to meet the needs of our wholesale partners and our own retail stores depends on the proper operation of this distribution facility. Kellwood will continue to provide distribution services, until we elect to terminate such services, as part of the Shared Services Agreement. We also have a warehouse in Belgium operated by a third-party logistics provider to support our wholesale orders for customers located primarily in Europe. There can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into other contracts for an alternate or replacement distribution centers on acceptable terms or at all. Such an event could disrupt our operations. In addition, because substantially all of our products are distributed from one location, our operations could also be interrupted by labor difficulties, or by floods, fires, earthquakes or other natural disasters near such facility. For example, a majority of our ocean shipments go through the ports in Los Angeles, which were recently subject to significant processing delays due to labor issues involving the port workers. We maintain business interruption insurance and are a beneficiary under similar Kellwood insurance policies related to Kellwood assets or services we utilize under the Shared Services Agreement. These policies, however, may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions to our distribution system. If we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve targeted operating efficiencies could be harmed. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe extent of our foreign sourcing may adversely affect our business.\nOur products are primarily produced by, and purchased or procured from, independent manufacturing contractors located outside of the U.S., with approximately 96% of our total revenue for fiscal 2014 attributable to manufacturing contractors located outside of the U.S. These manufacturing contractors are located mainly in countries in Asia and South America, with approximately 88% of our purchases for fiscal 2014 attributable to manufacturing contractors located in China. A manufacturing contractor\u2019s failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet the required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items. The failure to make timely deliveries may cause customers to cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. As a result of the magnitude of our foreign sourcing, our business is subject to the following risks:\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability in countries or regions, especially Asia, including heightened terrorism and other security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional or more frequent inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods;\n\u2022\nimposition of regulations, quotas and other trade restrictions relating to imports, including quotas imposed by bilateral textile agreements between the U.S. and foreign countries;\n\u2022\nimposition of increased duties, taxes and other charges on imports;\n\u2022\nlabor union strikes at ports through which our products enter the U.S.;\n\u2022\nlabor shortages in countries where contractors and suppliers are located;\n\u2022\na significant decrease in availability or an increase in the cost of raw materials;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds to or from foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndisease epidemics and health-related concerns, which could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;\n\u2022\nthe migration and development of manufacturing contractors, which could affect where our products are or are planned to be produced;\n\u2022\nincreases in the costs of fuel, travel and transportation;\n\u2022\nreduced manufacturing flexibility because of geographic distance between our foreign manufacturers and us, increasing the risk that we may have to mark down unsold inventory as a result of misjudging the market for a foreign-made product; and\n\u2022\nviolations by foreign contractors of labor and wage standards and resulting adverse publicity.\nIf these risks limit or prevent us from manufacturing products in any significant international market, prevent us from acquiring products from foreign suppliers, or significantly increase the cost of our products, our operations could be seriously disrupted until alternative suppliers are found or alternative markets are developed, which could negatively impact our business.\nWe do not have written agreements with any of our third-party manufacturing contractors. As a result, any single manufacturing contractor could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time. One of our manufacturers in China, with whom we have worked for over five years, accounted for the production of approximately 16% of our finished products during fiscal 2014. Supply disruptions from this manufacturer (or any of our other manufacturers) could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands, if we are unable to source suitable replacement materials at acceptable prices or at all. Our inability to promptly replace manufacturing contractors that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality products in a timely and cost-efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could cause delays and increase costs and cause our operating results and financial condition to suffer.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the fabrics or other raw materials, particularly cotton, silk, leather and synthetics used in our manufactured apparel, could have a material adverse effect on cost of sales or our ability to meet customer demands. The prices of fabrics depend largely on the market prices of the raw materials used to produce them. The price and availability of the raw materials and, in turn, the fabrics used in our apparel may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including crop yields, weather patterns, labor costs and changes in oil prices. We may not be able to create suitable design solutions that utilize raw materials with attractive prices or, alternatively, to pass higher raw materials prices and related transportation costs on to our customers. We are not always successful in our efforts to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of raw materials, and our business can be materially affected by dramatic movements in prices of raw materials. The ultimate effect of this change on our earnings cannot be quantified, as the effect of movements in raw materials prices on industry selling prices are uncertain, but any significant increase in these prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur reliance on independent manufacturers could cause delays or quality issues which could damage customer relationships.\nWe use independent manufacturers to assemble or produce all of our products, whether inside or outside the U.S. We are dependent on the ability of these independent manufacturers to adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing capacity. The use of independent manufacturers to produce finished goods and the resulting lack of direct control could subject us to difficulty in obtaining timely delivery of products of acceptable quality. We generally do not have long-term contracts with any independent\nmanufacturers. Alternative manufacturers, if available, may not be able to provide us with products or services of a comparable quality, at an acceptable price or on a timely basis. Identifying a suitable supplier is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with their quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability and labor and other ethical practices. There can be no assurance that there will not be a disruption in the supply of our products from independent manufacturers or, in the event of a disruption, that we would be able to substitute suitable alternative manufacturers in a timely manner. The failure of any independent manufacturer to perform or the loss of any independent manufacturer could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our independent manufacturers fail to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations, our brand image could be harmed due to negative publicity.\nWe have established and currently maintain operating guidelines which promote ethical business practices such as fair wage practices, compliance with child labor laws and other local laws. While we monitor compliance with those guidelines, we do not control our independent manufacturers or their business practices. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee their compliance with our guidelines. A lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers, which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products, product shortages or other disruptions of our operations.\nViolation of labor or other laws by our independent manufacturers or the divergence of an independent manufacturer\u2019s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the U.S. or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and our brand. From time to time, our audit results have revealed a lack of compliance in certain respects, including with respect to local labor, safety and environmental laws. Other fashion companies have faced criticism after highly-publicized incidents or compliance issues have occurred or been exposed at factories producing their products. To the extent our manufacturers do not bring their operations into compliance with such laws or resolve material issues identified in any of our audit results, we may face similar criticism and negative publicity. This could diminish the value of our brand image and reduce demand for our merchandise. In addition, other fashion companies have encountered organized boycotts of their products in such situations. If we, or other companies in our industry, encounter similar problems in the future, it could harm our brand image, stock price and results of operations.\nMonitoring compliance by independent manufacturers is complicated by the fact that expectations of ethical business practices continually evolve, may be substantially more demanding than applicable legal requirements and are driven in part by legal developments and by diverse groups active in publicizing and organizing public responses to perceived ethical shortcomings. Accordingly, we cannot predict how such expectations might develop in the future and cannot be certain that our guidelines would satisfy all parties who are active in monitoring and publicizing perceived shortcomings in labor and other business practices worldwide.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenue and income from operations, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal variations in our net revenue and income from operations. Seasonal variations in our net revenue are primarily related to increased sales of our products during our fiscal third and fourth quarters, reflecting our historical strength in sales during the fall and holiday seasons. Historically, seasonable variations in our income from operations have been driven principally by increased net revenue in such fiscal quarters.\nOur rapid growth may have overshadowed whatever seasonal or cyclical factors might have influenced our business to date. In addition, as our revenue mix evolves over time to include more sales from additional retail stores, we may see an increase in the percentage of sales occurring during the fourth quarter. Such seasonal or cyclical variations in our business may harm our results of operations in the future, if we do not plan inventory appropriately, if customer shopping patterns fluctuate during such seasonal periods or if bad weather during the fourth quarter constrains shopping activity.\nAny future seasonal or quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors to assess the longer-term profitability and strength of our business at any particular point, which could lead to increased volatility in our stock price. Increased volatility could cause our stock price to suffer in comparison to less volatile investments.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing retail and office space, are generally subject to long-term non-cancelable leases and are required to make substantial lease payments under our operating leases, and any failure to make these lease payments when due would likely harm our business, profitability and results of operations.\nWe do not own any of our stores, or our offices including our New York and Los Angeles offices, or our showroom space in Paris but instead lease all of such space under operating leases. Our leases generally have initial terms of 10 years, and generally can be extended only for one additional 5-year term. All of our leases require a fixed annual rent, and most require the payment of additional rent if store sales exceed a negotiated amount. Most of our leases are \u201cnet\u201d leases, which require us to pay all of the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities, and we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option. Additionally, certain of our leases allow the lessor to terminate the lease if we do not achieve a specified gross sales threshold. We have experienced circumstances in the past where landlords have attempted to invoke these contractual provisions. Although we believe we will achieve the required threshold to continue those leases, we cannot assure you that we will do so. Any loss of our store locations due to underperformance may harm our results of operations, stock price and reputation.\nPayments under these leases account for a significant portion of our selling, general and administrative expenses. For example, as of January 31, 2015, we were a party to operating leases associated with our retail stores and our office and showroom spaces requiring future minimum lease payments of $15.6 million in the aggregate through fiscal 2015 and approximately $134.5 million thereafter. We expect that any new retail stores we open will also be leased by us under operating leases, which will further increase our operating lease expenses and require significant capital expenditures. Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including, among others:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our available cash to pay our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry in which we compete; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage with respect to some of our competitors.\nWe depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under our credit facilities or from other sources, we may not be able to service our operating lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would harm our business.\nIn addition, additional sites that we lease are likely to be subject to similar long-term non-cancelable leases. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term if we cannot negotiate a mutually acceptable termination payment. In addition, as our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations or incur costs in relocating our office space. Of our existing leases, no existing retail leases expire in fiscal 2015. If we are unable to enter into new leases or renew existing leases on terms acceptable to us or be released from our obligations under leases for stores that we close, our business, profitability and results of operations may be harmed.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may materially increase our costs and/or make it harder for us to compete as an employer.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act imposed new mandates on employers, requiring employers with 50 or more full-time employees to provide \u201ccredible\u201d health insurance to employees or pay a financial penalty. Given our current health plan design, and assuming the law is implemented without significant changes, these mandates could materially increase our costs. Moreover, if we choose to opt out of offering health insurance to our employees, we may become less attractive as an employer and it may be harder for us to compete for qualified employees.\nChanges in laws, including employment laws and laws related to our merchandise, could make conducting our business more expensive or otherwise change the way we do business.\nWe are subject to numerous regulations, including labor and employment, customs, truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, and zoning and occupancy laws and ordinances that regulate retailers generally or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. If these regulations were to change or were violated by our management, employees, vendors, independent manufacturers or partners, the costs of certain goods could increase, or we could experience delays in shipments of our products, be subject to fines or penalties, or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and hurt our business and results of operations.\nIn addition to increased regulatory compliance requirements, changes in laws could make ordinary conduct of business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business. For example, changes in federal and state minimum wage laws could raise the wage requirements for certain of our employees at our retail locations, which would increase our selling costs and may cause us to reexamine our wage structure for such employees. Other laws related to employee benefits and treatment of employees, including laws related to limitations on employee hours, supervisory status, leaves of absence, mandated health benefits, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates and citizenship requirements, could negatively impact us, by increasing compensation and benefits costs which would in turn reduce our profitability.\nMoreover, changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs to us for certain merchandise, or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale. It is often difficult for us to plan and prepare for potential changes to applicable laws and future actions or payments related to such changes could be material to us.\nOur operations are restricted by our new credit facilities entered into on November 27, 2013.\nWe entered into a revolving credit facility and a term loan facility in connection with the IPO and Restructuring Transactions closed on November 27, 2013. Our new facilities contain significant restrictive covenants. These covenants may impair our financing and operational flexibility and make it difficult for us to react to market conditions and satisfy our ongoing capital needs and unanticipated cash requirements. Specifically, such covenants will likely restrict our ability and, if applicable, the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nuse assets as security in other transactions;\n\u2022\npay dividends;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022\nguarantee the debt of others;\n\u2022\nenter into new lines of businesses;\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or exchange our debt; and\n\u2022\nform any joint ventures or subsidiary investments.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance. If we fail to comply with such covenants and terms, we would be required to obtain waivers from our lenders to maintain compliance with our debt obligations. If we are unable to obtain any necessary waivers and the debt is accelerated, a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future operating performance would likely result. The terms of our debt obligations may restrict or delay our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement, delayed or unpaid amounts thereunder would accrue interest at a default rate of one-year LIBOR plus 200 basis points until paid. Our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could result in a failure to comply with covenants or financial ratios required by our debt financing agreements and could result in an event of default under such a debt financing. See \u201cTax Receivable Agreement\u201d under Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10-K for further information.\nWe are required to pay to the Pre-IPO Stockholders 85% of certain tax benefits, and could be required to make substantial cash payments in which our stockholders will not participate.\nWe entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with the Pre-IPO Stockholders in connection with the IPO and Restructuring Transactions which closed on November 27, 2013. Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, we will be obligated to pay to the Pre-IPO Stockholders an amount equal to 85% of the cash savings in federal, state and local income tax realized by us by virtue of our future use of the federal, state and local net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) held by us as of November 27, 2013, together with section 197 intangible deductions (collectively, the \u201cPre-IPO Tax Benefits\u201d). \u201cSection 197 intangible deductions\u201d means amortization deductions with respect to certain amortizable intangible assets which are held by us and our subsidiaries immediately after November 27, 2013. Cash tax savings generally will be computed by comparing our actual federal, state and local income tax liability to the amount of such taxes that we would have been required to pay had such Pre-IPO Tax Benefits not been available to us. While payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement will depend upon a number of factors, including the amount and timing of taxable income we generate in the future and any future limitations that may be imposed on our ability to use the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits, the payments could be substantial. Assuming the federal, state and local corporate income tax rates presently in effect, no material change in applicable tax law and no limitation on our ability to use the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), the estimated cash benefit of the full use of these Pre-IPO Tax Benefits would be approximately $202 million, of which 85%, or approximately $172 million, is potentially payable to the Pre-IPO Stockholders under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. The Tax Receivable Agreement accordingly could require us to make substantial cash payments.\nAlthough we are not aware of any issue that would cause the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) to challenge any tax benefits arising under the Tax Receivable Agreement, the affiliates of Sun Capital will not reimburse us for any payments previously made if such benefits subsequently were disallowed, although the amount of any tax savings subsequently disallowed will reduce any future payment otherwise owed to the Pre-IPO Stockholders. For example, if our determinations regarding the applicability (or lack thereof) and amount of any limitations on the NOLs under Section 382 of the Code were to be successfully challenged by the IRS after payments relating to such NOLs had been made to the Pre-IPO Stockholders, we would not be reimbursed by the Pre-IPO Stockholders and our recovery would be limited to the extent of future payments (if any) otherwise remaining under the Tax Receivable Agreement. As a result, in such circumstances we could make payments to the Pre-IPO Stockholders under the Tax Receivable Agreement in excess of our actual cash\ntax savings. Furthermore, while we will generally only make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement after we have recognized a cash flow benefit from the utilization of the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits (other than upon a change of control or other acceleration event), the payments required under the agreement could require us to use a substantial portion of our cash from operations for those purposes.\nAt the effective date of the Tax Receivable Agreement, the liability recognized was accounted for in our financial statements as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. Subsequent changes in the Tax Receivable Agreement liability will be recorded through earnings in operating expenses. Even if the NOLs are available to us, the Tax Receivable Agreement will operate to transfer 85% of the benefit to the Pre-IPO Stockholders. Additionally, the payments we make to the Pre-IPO Stockholders under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not expected to give rise to any incidental tax benefits to us, such as deductions or an adjustment to the basis of our assets.\nFederal and state laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of NOL carry-forwards in the event of an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. Under the rules, such an ownership change is generally any change in ownership of more than 50 percent of a company\u2019s stock within a rolling three-year period, as calculated in accordance with the rules. The rules generally operate by focusing on changes in ownership among stockholders considered by the rules as owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of the company and any change in ownership arising from new issuances of stock by the company.\nWhile we have performed an analysis under Section 382 of the Code that indicates the IPO and Restructuring Transactions would not constitute an ownership change, such technical guidelines are complex and subject to significant judgment and interpretation. With the IPO and Restructuring Transactions and other transactions that have occurred over the past three years, we may trigger or have already triggered an \u201cownership change\u201d limitation. We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use the pre-change NOL carry-forwards (after giving effect to payments to be made to the Pre-IPO Stockholders under the Tax Receivable Agreement) to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our analysis to date under Section 382 of the Code indicates that the IPO Restructuring Transactions have not triggered an \u201cownership change\u201d limitation.\nIf we did not enter into the Tax Receivable Agreement, we would be entitled to realize the full economic benefit of the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits, to the extent allowed by federal, state and local law, including Section 382 of the Code. Subject to exceptions, the Tax Receivable Agreement is designed with the objective of causing our annual cash costs attributable to federal state and local income taxes (without regard to our continuing 15% interest in the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits) to be the same as we would have paid had we not had the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits available to offset our federal, state and local taxable income. As a result, we will not be entitled to the economic benefit of the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits that would have been available if the Tax Receivable Agreement were not in effect (except to the extent of our continuing 15% interest in the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits).\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the Pre-IPO stockholders may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits.\nUpon the election of an affiliate of Sun Capital to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement pursuant to a change in control (as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement) or upon our election to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early, all of our payment and other obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be accelerated and will become due and payable. Additionally, the Tax Receivable Agreement provides that in the event that we breach any of our material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement by operation of law as a result of the rejection of the Tax Receivable Agreement in a case commenced under Title 11 of the United States Code (the \u201cBankruptcy Code\u201d) then all of our payment and other obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be accelerated and will become due and payable.\nIn the case of any such acceleration, we would be required to make an immediate payment equal to 85% of the present value of the tax savings represented by any portion of the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits for which payment under the Tax Receivable Agreement has not already been made, which upfront payment may be made years in advance of the actual realization of such future benefits. Such payments could be substantial and could exceed our actual cash tax savings from the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits. In these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash available or that we will be able to finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nIf we were to elect to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement, based on a discount rate equal to monthly LIBOR plus 200 basis points, we estimate that we would be required to pay approximately $159 million in the aggregate under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nWe could incur significant costs in complying with environmental, health and safety laws or as a result of satisfying any liability or obligation imposed under such laws.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. We could be held liable for the costs to address contamination of any real property ever owned, operated or used as a disposal site. In addition, in the event that Kellwood becomes financially incapable of addressing the environmental liability incurred prior to the structural reorganization separating Kellwood from Vince that occurred on November 27, 2013, a third party may file suit and attempt to allege that Kellwood and Vince engaged in a fraudulent transfer by arguing that the purpose of the separation of the non-Vince assets from Vince Holding Corp. was to insulate our assets from the environmental liability. For example, pursuant to a Consent Decree with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) and the State of Missouri, a non-Vince subsidiary, which was separated from us in the Restructuring Transactions, is conducting a cleanup of contamination at the site of a plant in New Haven, Missouri, which occurred between 1973 and 1985. Kellwood has posted a letter of credit in the amount of $5.9 million as a performance guarantee for the estimated cost of the required remediation work. If, despite the financial assurance provided by Kellwood as required by the EPA, Kellwood became financially unable to address this remediation, and if the corporate separateness of Vince is disregarded or if a fraudulent transfer is found to have occurred, we could be liable for the full amount of the remediation. If this were to occur or if we were to become liable for other environmental liabilities or obligations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe will continue to incur significant expenses as a result of being a public company, which will negatively impact our financial performance and could cause our results of operations and financial condition to suffer.\nWe will continue to incur significant legal, accounting, insurance, share-based compensation and other expenses as a result of being a public company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as related rules implemented by the SEC and the securities regulators and by the NYSE, have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. We expect that compliance with these laws, rules and regulations, including compliance with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act once we are no longer an emerging growth company, will substantially increase our expenses, including our legal and accounting costs, and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We also expect these laws, rules and regulations to make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or to incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as officers. To assist in the recruitment of qualified directors, officers and other members of senior management and to help align their interests with those of our stockholders, we have made and intend to continue to make equity grants under our current management equity incentive plan (the \u201cVince 2013 Incentive Plan\u201d). As a result of the foregoing, we expect an increase in legal, accounting, insurance, share-based compensation and certain other expenses in the future, which will negatively impact our financial performance and could cause our results of operations and financial condition to suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Structure and Ownership\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d controlled by investment funds advised by affiliates of Sun Capital, whose interests in our business may be different from yours.\nAffiliates of Sun Capital owned approximately 55% of our outstanding common stock as of March 20, 2015. As such, affiliates of Sun Capital will, for the foreseeable future, have significant influence over our reporting and corporate management and affairs, and will be able to control virtually all matters requiring stockholder approval. For so long as affiliates of Sun Capital own 30% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock, Sun Cardinal, LLC, an affiliate of Sun Capital, will have the right to designate a majority of our board of directors. For so long as affiliates of Sun Capital have the right to designate a majority of our board of directors, the directors designated by affiliates of Sun Capital are expected to constitute a majority of each committee of our board of directors, other than the Audit Committee, and the chairman of each of the committees, other than the Audit Committee, is expected to be a director serving on such committee who is designated by affiliates of Sun Capital, provided that, at such time as we are not a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the NYSE corporate governance standards, our committee membership will comply with all applicable requirements of those standards and a majority of our board of directors will be \u201cindependent directors,\u201d as defined under the rules of the NYSE (subject to applicable phase-in rules).\nAs a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d the rules of the NYSE exempt us from the obligation to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that a majority of our board of directors consists of \u201cindependent directors,\u201d as defined under such rules, and that we have nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees that are each composed entirely of independent directors. These exemptions do not modify the requirement for a fully independent audit committee, which we have. Similarly, once we are no longer a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we must comply with the independent board committee requirements as they relate to the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees, which are permitted to be phased-in as follows: (1) one independent committee member on the date we cease to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d; (2) a majority of independent committee members within 90 days of such date; and (3) all independent committee members within one year of such date. Additionally, we will have 12 months from the date we cease to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d to have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors.\nAffiliates of Sun Capital control actions to be taken by us, our board of directors and our stockholders, including amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and approval of significant corporate transactions, including mergers and sales of substantially all of our assets. The directors designated by affiliates of Sun Capital have the authority, subject to the terms of our indebtedness and the rules and regulations of the NYSE, to issue additional stock, implement stock repurchase programs, declare dividends and make other decisions. The NYSE independence standards are intended to ensure that directors who meet the independence standard are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the doctrine of \u201ccorporate opportunity\u201d does not apply against Sun Capital or its affiliates, or any of our directors who are associates of, or affiliated with, Sun Capital, in a manner that would prohibit them from investing in competing businesses or doing business with our partners or customers. It is possible that the interests of Sun Capital and its affiliates may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders, including you. For example, Sun Capital may have different tax positions from other stockholders which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when we should dispose of assets, whether and when we should incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the Tax Receivable Agreement, and whether and when we should terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement and accelerate our obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration tax or other considerations of Sun Capital and its affiliates even where no similar benefit would accrue to us. See \u201cTax Receivable Agreement\u201d under Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nWe are a holding company and we are dependent upon distributions from our subsidiaries to pay dividends, taxes and other expenses.\nVince Holding Corp. is a holding company with no material assets other than its ownership of membership interests in Vince Intermediate Holding, LLC, a holding company that has no material assets other than its interest in Vince, LLC. Neither Vince Holding Corp. nor Vince Intermediate Holding, LLC have any independent means of generating revenue. To the extent that we need funds, for a cash dividend to holders of our common stock or otherwise, and Vince Intermediate Holding, LLC or Vince, LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nWe file consolidated income tax returns on behalf of Vince Holding Corp. and Vince Intermediate Holding, LLC. Most of our future tax obligations will likely be attributed to the operations of Vince, LLC. Accordingly, most of the payments against the Tax Receivable Agreement will be attributed to the operations of Vince, LLC. We intend to cause Vince, LLC to pay distributions or make funds available to us in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay our taxes and any payments due to certain of our stockholders under the Tax Receivable Agreement. If, as a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, we do not have sufficient funds to pay tax or other liabilities, we may have to borrow funds and thus our liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest at a default rate of one-year LIBOR plus 500 basis points until paid. See \u201cTax Receivable Agreement\u201d under Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nAnti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay and discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider to be favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our Company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe classification of our board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nthe authorization of the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022\nstockholder action can only be taken at a special or regular meeting and not by written consent following the time that Sun Capital and its affiliates cease to beneficially own a majority of our common stock;\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our board of directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nremoval of directors only for cause following the time that Sun Capital and its affiliates cease to beneficially own a majority of our common stock;\n\u2022\nallowing Sun Cardinal to fill any vacancy on our board of directors for so long as affiliates of Sun Capital own 30% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock and thereafter, allowing only our board of directors to fill vacancies on our board of directors; and\n\u2022\nfollowing the time that Sun Capital and its affiliates cease to beneficially own a majority of our common stock, super-majority voting requirements to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), and prevents us from engaging in a business combination, such as a merger, with a person or group who acquires at least 15% of our voting stock for a period of three years from the date such person became an interested stockholder, unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to acquisition. However, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that both Sun Capital and its affiliates and any persons to whom a Sun Capital affiliate sells its common stock will be deemed to have been approved by our board of directors.\nThese anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change of control of our Company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the sole and exclusive forum for any of the following: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and have elected to comply with reduced public company reporting requirements, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined by the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we have chosen to take advantage of certain exemptions from various public company reporting requirements. These exemptions include, but are not limited to, (i) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements, and (iii) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years after the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), which such fifth anniversary will occur in 2018. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such five-year period, including if we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d our annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we would cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period. We will become a large accelerated filer the year after we have an aggregate worldwide market value of the voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates of $700 million or more. We have taken advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this annual report on Form 10-K and may elect to take advantage of other reduced burdens in future filings. As a result, the information we provide to holders of our common stock may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in\nwhich you hold equity interests. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choice we make to reduce disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price for our common stock may be more volatile.\nAs an emerging growth company we are not required to comply with the rules of the SEC implementing Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and therefore our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting until the year following the year we cease to be an emerging growth company. We are required, however, to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Section 302 and 404 other than 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These rules require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of controls over financial reporting. If we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified report as and when required by Section 404 or we are required to restate our financial statements, we may fail to meet our public reporting obligations and investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative impact on the trading price of our stock.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. However, we have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.", "PERMNO": 14296, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "VNCE"}
