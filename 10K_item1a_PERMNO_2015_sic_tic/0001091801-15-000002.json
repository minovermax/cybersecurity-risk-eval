{"cik": "1091801", "company": "MARTHA STEWART LIVING OMNIMEDIA INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock. Although the risks and uncertainties listed below are those that we consider significant, material risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us may also adversely affect our operations.\nOur success depends in part on the continued success of our brands and the reputation and popularity of Martha Stewart and Emeril Lagasse. Any adverse reactions to publicity relating to Ms. Stewart or Mr. Lagasse, or the loss of either of their services, could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and our ability to maintain or generate a consumer base.\nThe brand identity that we have developed has significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the Martha Stewart Living brand is critical to expanding our base of media and merchandise consumers and merchandising and licensing partners. Our brand may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including the reputation of our content and products, our ability to adapt to technological changes, the uniqueness and relevance of our content, and the reputation and popularity of Martha Stewart. Maintaining and enhancing the Martha Stewart Living brand will depend largely on our ability to be a leader in providing life-style content and high quality products, which we may not do successfully. If we fail to maintain and enhance our brand, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results, and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.\nFurther, while we believe there has been significant consumer acceptance for our products and services as stand-alone brands, the image, reputation, popularity and talent of Martha Stewart and Emeril Lagasse remain important factors of our success.\nMs. Stewart\u2019s efforts, personality and leadership, including her services as an officer and director of MSO, have been, and continue to be, critical to our success. While in the past we have managed our business without her daily participation, an extended or permanent loss of her services due to disability, death or some other cause, or any repeated or sustained negative shifts in public or industry perceptions of her, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, in 2008 we acquired the assets relating to Emeril Lagasse\u2019s businesses other than his restaurants and foundation (the \u201cEmeril Assets\u201d). The value of the Emeril Assets is largely related to the ongoing popularity and participation of Mr. Lagasse in the activities related to exploiting these assets. If Mr. Lagasse were to lose popularity with the public or be unable to participate in our business for any reason, the continued value of the Emeril Assets could be materially adversely affected. Any material disruption in Mr. Lagasse\u2019s popularity or ability to participate in our business could potentially force us to further write-down a significant amount of the value we paid for these assets. See the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, specifically Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for a description of our intangible asset and goodwill impairment charge related to our Emeril Lagasse business.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our anticipated growth strategies.\nAs part of our strategy for growth, we seek to expand our brands and merchandise categories domestically as well as grow the international presence of our merchandise programs and publications. Such endeavors involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations and increased short-term costs without any current revenue, which may be dilutive to our earnings in the short term. Although we believe that our strategy will lead to long-term growth in revenue and profitability, we may not realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits. The failure to realize benefits, which may be due to our inability to execute plans, global or local economic conditions, competition, changes in the industries\nin which we operate and the other risks described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe continue to expand our merchandising and licensing programs into new products and categories, the failure of which could diminish the perceived value of our brand, impair our ability to grow and adversely affect our prospects.\nOur growth depends to a significant degree upon our ability to develop new or expand existing merchandising and licensing programs, both domestically and internationally. In recent years, we have entered into several merchandising and licensing agreements, some of which include exclusivity provisions and a long-term duration. We are not able to ensure that our expansion into new business areas will be met with approval from consumers nor can we guarantee that these programs will be fully implemented, or, if implemented, that they will be successful. We may be prohibited from seeking different channels for our products due to the exclusivity provisions and multi-year terms of these agreements and the lack of financial viability of our existing partners or disputes with new or existing licensees may arise that could hinder our ability to grow or expand our product lines as well as prevent or delay our ability to collect the licensing revenue that we expect from our licensing or merchandising partners. We also may not be able to successfully promote our brand and merchandise internationally nor find suitable partners in certain geographies to expand our international licensing and merchandising programs.\nFurther, while we contractually require that our merchandising partners and licensees maintain the quality of our respective brands, we cannot be certain that our partners, or their manufacturers and distributors, will honor their contractual obligations or that they will not take other actions that will diminish the value of our brands. If such developments occur or our merchandising programs are otherwise not successful, the value and recognition of our brands, as well as our business, financial condition and prospects, could be materially adversely affected.\nOur continued growth is dependent on continuously developing and offering new products and services to our existing merchandising partners.\nThe continued growth of our business will depend in part on our ability to develop and offer new products and services to our existing merchandising partners that successfully gain market acceptance by addressing the needs of our current and future customers and remain consistent with the look and feel of our brands. Although we devote significant resources to meet this goal, there can be no assurance as to our continued ability to develop, launch and market successful new products or variants of existing products, nor can we guarantee that these products will be successful or profitable. In addition, both the launch and ongoing success of new products are costly and inherently uncertain, especially as to their appeal to consumers. Our failure to successfully launch new products could decrease demand for our existing products by negatively affecting consumer perception of our brands, as well have an adverse effect on our profitability from year to year based on the number and timing of new product launches.\nIf we are unable to predict, respond to and influence trends in what the public finds appealing, our brands and business will be adversely affected.\nThe success of our brands and our business depends on our ability to originate product trends and to provide creative, useful and attractive ideas, information, concepts, programming and content that strongly appeal to a large number of consumers. Our content and products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. If we are unable to respond quickly and effectively to changes in consumer tastes and trends for ideas, information, concepts, programming, technology, content and products or if our new content or products are not accepted by our consumers, our competitors could introduce similar content or products in a more timely fashion which could hurt the strength of our brand and our business. Further, even if we are successful in anticipating shifts in consumer tastes and trends, we cannot be sure that our new ideas and content will have the appeal and garner the acceptance that they have in the past. Our failure to effectively predict, respond to or introduce new content or products that are accepted by consumers could result could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe are dependent on our partnership with Meredith for ongoing publication, distribution and monetization of Martha Stewart Living, our flagship magazine, as well as hosting, advertising and other services related to marthastewart.com, and a disruption in our relationship with Meredith could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operation.\nIn October 2014, we entered into a strategic relationship with Meredith pursuant to which we discontinued publication of Martha Stewart Living and our digital operations. Effective November 1, 2014, Meredith assumed responsibility for advertising sales, circulation and production of Martha Stewart Living and Martha Stewart Weddings and related special interest publications, including Martha Stewart\u2019s Real Weddings, in the United States and Canada. Meredith will also host, operate, maintain and provide advertising sales and related functions for our websites. Pursuant to this relationship, we will continue to own our underlying intellectual property and will produce all editorial content for our magazines and websites and Meredith\nwill license such intellectual property and content from us. Our agreement with Meredith gives Meredith the responsibility to generate revenues for our magazines and websites and our ability to realize the full strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with Meredith depends significantly on Meredith\u2019s ability to successfully market and sell our magazines and websites. With respect to Martha Stewart Living, our agreement provides that Meredith will pay for content it requests from us at a per page rate and is obligated to pay us a portion of any related operating profit upon achievement of certain financial milestones. With respect to our digital properties, Meredith is obligated to pay us a share of all digital advertising revenue. If Meredith\u2019s operations are seriously disrupted for any reason, and Meredith is unable to provide the services to us, it could adversely affect our business and our profitability. Further, if Meredith (1) fails to execute our strategy for video distribution, (2) fails to generate digital advertising revenue, or diverts its priorities to obtaining print advertising rather than digital advertising, or (3) discontinues selling our websites directly and instead sells the websites as a bundle with its other brands, therefore reducing our digital advertising rates, then the share of digital advertising revenue we could receive under our agreement would decrease and we would be unable to realize the full financial benefits of the partnership. With respect to Martha Stewart Weddings, as Meredith is providing services to us on a cost-plus basis, we also continue to be exposed to fluctuations in postage, paper, distribution and other circulation-related expenses.\nFurther, while our agreement with Meredith has a ten-year term, Meredith has the right to terminate our agreement without cause after the second anniversary of the agreement. Upon a termination of our agreement, we would have the right to purchase (i) any or all of the assets, rights, properties and business of our print publications and/or (ii) the websites and digital properties and related traffic and consumer data. If we do not exercise this right, any transition of operations related to publishing, distributing, advertising and marketing our print publications and hosting, operating and providing advertising sales and related functions for our digital properties internally would divert management attention and expose us to significant costs. In particular, any transfer of print operations from Meredith to us would require us to rebuild our historic volume of advertising as well as to reacquire our historic number of subscribers. In addition, although we receive a backup of our digital content, the technology used by Meredith to host and maintain the websites and digital properties differs from ours and any transition of digital operations from Meredith could require us to rebuild our technology infrastructure, which could result in significant costs to us. Our inability to effectively and efficiently transition these operations internally could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, our business and brand depends, in part, on the ongoing publication of our magazines and websites at high-quality levels and any failure to successfully promote the magazines or websites or any deviation from our historic high-quality levels of production may decrease the value of our brand and our business.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries which subject us to competitive pressures and other uncertainties.\nWe compete in industries that are highly competitive. With respect to our original and unique content, our current and potential competitors vary by size, offerings and geographic region and range from blogs and other do-it-yourself websites and digital applications that compete with discrete content offerings to large media conglomerations that offer, or may be planning to offer, content and publications broadly competitive with what our content offerings. Increased competition for our print and digital content may reduce our market share and brand recognition and decrease our ability to obtain advertising dollars. Further, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to create the variety and types of content, products and interactive experiences that meet rapidly changing consumer demand in a timely manner, if at all. Any such failure to do so could adversely affect user and customer experiences.\nOur Merchandising segment competitors consist of mass-market, home improvement and department stores that compete with similar stores in which our products are sold. Our merchandising lines also compete within the mass-market, home improvement and department stores that carry our product lines with other products offered by these stores in the same product categories we sell in, including with products sold under our partners' private labels. We also compete with the internet businesses of these stores and other websites that sell similar retail goods. In general, competitive factors include quality, price, style, name recognition and service.\nOur failure to meet competitive pressures could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business has been, and will continue to be, affected by worldwide economic conditions and a failure of the economy to sustain its recovery or a renewed decline in consumer spending could materially adversely affect the value of our assets, our revenues and the results of our operations.\nMany economic and other factors outside of our control, including consumer credit availability, increased unemployment, a downturn in housing sales and remodels and declines in consumer confidence and consumer spending, particularly discretionary spending, have had an adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations. In our Merchandising segment, economic weakness and unfavorable consumer spending trends continue to impact spending on general merchandise and homes and home improvement projects-categories in which we license our brands-resulting in weaker revenues from our\nlicensed products. If our merchandising partners experience declining revenues or other financial difficulties as a result of global economic conditions, this could result in their unwillingness to continue to sell our products, their inability to timely meet their royalty payment obligations to us, extended payment terms, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts, and increased bad debt expense. Further, if our merchandising partners experience severe financial difficulty, some may become insolvent and cease business operations, which would reduce the availability of our licensed products to consumers. We cannot predict the future health and viability of the companies with which we do business and upon which we depend for royalty revenues, advertising dollars and credit.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel and our ability to retain or motivate our key personnel.\nWe rely on the continued availability and service of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, members of our executive team and other key employees. The loss of the services of any key individual could harm us. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain additional qualified personnel. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nWe may record future intangible asset impairment charges, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe perform our annual impairment test for intangible assets on October 1st of each year, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In evaluating the potential for impairment we make assumptions regarding revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows, tax rates, and discount rates. These assumptions are uncertain and by nature may vary from actual results. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values of our intangible assets could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations. See the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, specifically Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for a description of our intangible asset and goodwill impairment charge related to our Emeril Lagasse business.\nElectronically stored data is subject to the risk of unauthorized access and if our data is compromised in spite of our attempts at protecting this data, we may incur significant costs, lost opportunities and damage to our reputation.\nWe maintain information necessary to conduct our business, including confidential, proprietary and personal information in digital form. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. We develop and maintain systems to prevent this from occurring, but the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Moreover, despite our efforts, the possibility of intrusion, tampering and theft cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with each of these remain. If our data systems are compromised or if the proprietary information of our customers or employees is misappropriated, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, our reputation with our customers and employees may be injured resulting in loss of business or morale and we could be exposed to a risk of loss due to business interruption, or litigation.\nMartha Stewart controls our Company through her stock ownership. As a result, Ms. Stewart has the ability to elect most of our board of directors, prevent or cause a change of control, or approve, prevent or influence certain actions by us.\nAs of February 28, 2015, Ms. Stewart beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, shares of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock (with one vote per share) and Class B Common Stock (with 10 votes per share) having approximately 89.0% of the outstanding voting power of our Common Stock and Ms. Stewart is our Chief Creative Officer and the Non-Executive Chairman of our Board. As a result of her stock ownership and position at the Company, Ms. Stewart has the ability to exercise significant control and influence over our business, including, without limitation, all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendments to the certificate of incorporation and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our Company or its assets, for the foreseeable future. Moreover, Ms. Stewart\u2019s concentrated control could, among other things, discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses and stockholders.\nOur intellectual property may be infringed upon or others may accuse us of infringing on their intellectual property, either of which could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations.\nOur business is highly dependent upon our creativity, valuable brands, content and the resulting intellectual property. We believe our proprietary trademarks and other intellectual property rights are valuable to our continued success and our\ncompetitive position. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing our intellectual property rights and imitation of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands and assets or otherwise adversely affect our revenues and our business. Although we vigorously defend our intellectual property rights, we may not be able to successfully protect our proprietary rights especially in foreign countries where the laws do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent the laws of the United States do. Further, if we are alleged to have infringed the intellectual property rights of another party, any resulting litigation could be costly and could damage our reputation. Litigation also diverts the time and resources of management, regardless of the merits of the claim. There can be no assurance that we would prevail in any litigation relating to our intellectual property. If we were to lose such a case, and be required to cease the sale of certain products or the use of certain technology or if we were forced to pay monetary damages, the results could adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 87277, "SIC": 4888, "TIC": "MSO"}
