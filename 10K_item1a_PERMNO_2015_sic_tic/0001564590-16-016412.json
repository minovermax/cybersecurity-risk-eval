{"cik": "1322554", "company": "Xactly Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-04-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, before making a decision to invest in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks related to our business\nWe have a history of losses, and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe generated net losses of $24.7 million, $18.5 million and $14.5 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of January 31, 2016 we had an accumulated deficit of $140.5 million. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels in future periods in order to become and remain profitable. We intend to continue to expend significant funds to expand our marketing and sales operations, develop and enhance our incentive compensation and employee and sales performance management solutions, meet the increased compliance requirements associated with our operation as a public company, scale our professional services capabilities and expand into new markets. Our efforts to grow our business may be more costly than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our higher operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described in this filing, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown events. We may not be able to maintain or increase our revenue levels, and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur business substantially depends on the continued growth in demand for incentive compensation and employee and sales performance management solutions.\nThe market for incentive compensation and employee and sales performance management services and products, is relatively new and evolving. We believe one of our key challenges is to be able to demonstrate the benefit of our solutions and services to prospective customers such that they place purchases of our solutions and services at a higher priority relative to other projects to which they allocate a portion of their budget, including the maintenance or renewal of their existing solutions. Organizations with existing homegrown, manual, spreadsheet or on-premise solutions may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to a cloud-based solution like ours for a variety of reasons, including the perceived implementation costs and ongoing subscription costs. Our financial performance depends in large part on continued growth in the number of organizations adopting incentive compensation management, employee and sales performance management and other related solutions, and particularly cloud-based solutions, to manage the performance of their sales and non-sales organizations. The market for incentive compensation and employee and sales performance management solutions may not develop as we expect, or at all.\nGrowth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates which may not prove to be accurate. Forecasts relating to, among other things, the expected growth in the SaaS and cloud software market or the market for incentive compensation and employee and sales performance management solutions may prove to be inaccurate. Demand for incentive compensation and employee and sales performance management solutions depends substantially on the adoption of variable compensation practices by organizations, and such practices may not be adopted in accordance with our expectations or at all. Even if these markets experience the forecasted growth, we may not grow our business at similar rates, or at all. In any of these cases, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nCloud-based incentive compensation solutions such as ours represent a relatively recent approach to addressing incentive compensation challenges, and we may be forced to change the prices we charge for our solutions or the pricing model upon which they are based as the market for these types of solutions evolves, which may harm our business.\nThe market for cloud-based solutions to address incentive compensation challenges is still developing. Competitive dynamics may cause pricing levels and pricing models to change, as the market matures and as existing and new market participants introduce new types of solutions and different approaches to enable organizations to address their incentive compensation management needs. As a result, we may be forced to reduce the prices we charge for our solutions or the pricing model on which they are based, and may be unable to renew existing customer agreements or enter into new customer agreements at the same prices and upon the same terms that we have historically, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, gross margin and operating results.\nWe compete in a highly competitive market, and competitive pressures from existing and new companies may adversely impact our business, revenue, growth rates and market share.\nThe market for incentive compensation solutions for employee and sales performance management is highly competitive and significantly fragmented. With the introduction of new technologies and the potential entry of new competitors into the market, we expect competition to increase and intensify in the future, which could harm our ability to increase sales, maintain or increase renewals and maintain our prices. We compete primarily with companies offering incentive compensation and employee and sales performance management applications via hybrid cloud-based and on-premise solutions. We also compete with spreadsheets, homegrown systems, and toolsets and products developed by software providers that allow customers to build new applications that run on the customers\u2019 current infrastructure or as hosted services. Our competitors include Callidus, Cognos and Oracle among others.\nCompetition could significantly impede our ability to sell our incentive compensation and employee and sales performance management solutions on terms favorable to us. Our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future solutions less competitive, unmarketable or obsolete. In addition, if these competitors develop products with similar or superior functionality to our solutions, including big data analysis and benchmarking capabilities, streamlined user experiences or real-time mobile accessibility we may need to decrease the prices for our solutions in order to remain competitive. If we are unable to maintain our current pricing due to competitive pressures, our margins will be reduced and our operating results will be negatively affected.\nSome of our current competitors have, and future competitors may have, greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, greater resources to devote to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products and services, more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships and longer operating histories and greater name recognition. As a result, these competitors may be better able to respond quickly to new technologies and to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns. Some competitors may also be able to offer competing solutions at little or no additional cost by bundling them with a broader suite of solutions. In addition, if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete with such companies, the demand for our incentive compensation and employee and sales performance management solutions could decline substantially.\nWe operate in a rapidly evolving market and if we are unable to introduce new solutions or make enhancements to our existing solutions that successfully respond to emerging technological trends and achieve market acceptance, our growth rates would likely decline and our business, operating results and competitive position could suffer.\nIncentive compensation solutions and cloud-based software markets are generally characterized by:\n\u00b7\nrapid technological advances;\n\u00b7\nchanging customer needs; and\n\u00b7\nfrequent new product introductions and enhancements.\nTo keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements, achieve market acceptance and effectively respond to competition, we must quickly identify emerging trends and requirements, accurately define and design enhancements and improvements for existing solutions and services, and introduce new solutions and services. Accelerated introductions and short product life cycles for solutions and services require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, as we expand our business and target new industry verticals, we may be required to develop additional features for our solutions, expand our expertise in certain areas and add sales and support personnel possessing familiarity with relevant industry verticals.\nOur growth strategy depends, in part, on our ability to develop and launch new solutions on a timely basis. For example, in calendar year 2014, we launched two new products, Xactly Insights and Xactly Quota. We have also announced two new products, Xactly Inspire and Xactly Connect, expected to be available in the first half of calendar 2016. If existing and potential customers do not perceive the benefits of these new offerings, a market may not develop or may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would adversely affect our revenue growth prospects. We also face the risk that customers may not understand or be willing to bear the cost of incorporating these newer solutions into their organizations. In addition, we have limited experience in pricing any new solutions, such as Xactly Insights, Xactly Quota, Xactly Inspire, and Xactly Connect, which could result in underpricing that adversely affects our expected financial performance, or overpricing that inhibits our customers\u2019 acceptance of such new solutions. Even if the initial development and commercial introduction of any new solutions are successful, we cannot assure you that they will achieve widespread market acceptance or that any market acceptance will be sustainable over the longer term.\nMoreover, new solutions that we develop may not be introduced in a timely manner. If we are unable to successfully develop or enhance existing solutions, or if we fail to position and price our solutions to meet market demand, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers, our revenue growth will be adversely affected.\nTo increase our revenue, we must add new customers, increase the number of subscribers at existing customers and sell additional modules to current customers. As our industry matures or as competitors introduce lower cost and/or differentiated products or services that are perceived to compete with ours, our ability to sell based on pricing, technology and functionality could be impaired. As a result, we may be unable to attract new customers at rates or on terms that would be favorable or comparable to prior periods, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue and growth.\nOur sales cycles to our enterprise customers can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our sales are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly.\nOur sales efforts involve educating prospective customers and our existing customers about the use, technical capabilities and benefits of our solutions. In general, the enterprise customers we target may undertake a significant evaluation process before purchasing our solutions. As we continue to pursue enterprise customers, we may face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing such sales. We may spend substantial time, effort and money on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales. Events affecting our customers\u2019 businesses may occur during the sales cycle that could affect the size or timing of a purchase, contributing to more unpredictability in our business and operating results.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our calculated billings, revenue and expenses.\nWe believe there are seasonal factors that may cause calculated billings and professional services revenue to be higher in some quarters compared with others. Generally, the timing of calculated billings have been split approximately 40% in the first half of the fiscal year and 60% in the second half of the fiscal year. Also, professional services revenue reflects this seasonality and is generally higher in our first and fourth fiscal quarters. We believe\nthis variability is largely due to our customers\u2019 compensation plan design and budgetary and spending patterns. In addition, investments in sales and marketing programs are seasonally higher in our second and third fiscal quarters, primarily due to our end user CompCloud conference that we host during the second quarter and our participation in the salesforce.com DreamForce conference during the third quarter.\nOur business depends substantially on customers renewing their agreements and purchasing additional modules from us or adding additional subscribers. Any decline in our customer renewals or purchases of additional modules or subscriptions would harm our future operating results.\nIn order for us to improve our operating results, it is important that our customers renew their agreements with us when their contract terms expire and also purchase additional solutions and modules and add additional subscribers. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after the initial subscription period, and we cannot assure you that customers will renew subscriptions with the same or higher number of modules, if at all. In the past, some of our customers have elected not to renew their agreements with us or have renewed their agreements with a lower number of subscribers or with fewer modules. Our customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our solutions, pricing, the prices of competing products or services, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base, reduced hiring by our customers, reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels or the loss of an executive sponsor at a customer. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions, renew on less favorable terms, fail to purchase additional solutions or modules, or fail to add additional subscriptions, our revenue may decline, and our operating results may be harmed.\nShifts over time in the mix of sizes or types of organizations that purchase our solutions or changes in the components of our solutions purchased by our customers could negatively affect our operating results.\nOur strategy is to sell our incentive compensation and employee and sales performance management solutions to organizations of broadly different sizes, from FORTUNE 50 enterprises to small, emerging companies. Our gross margin can vary depending on numerous factors related to the implementation and use of our incentive compensation and sales performance management solutions, including the sophistication and intensity of our customers\u2019 use of our solutions and the level of professional services and support required by a customer. Sales to enterprise customers may entail longer sales cycles and more significant selling efforts, and the prices we charge each customer per subscriber are driven, in part, by subscriber attributes and the number of subscribers for which that customer has contracted, with generally lower prices per subscriber for larger contracts consistent with industry practice.\nSelling to small, emerging companies may involve smaller contract sizes, higher relative selling costs, greater risk of non-renewal and greater credit risk and uncertainty. If the mix of organizations that purchase our solutions changes, or the mix of solution components purchased by our customers changes, our gross margins could decrease and our operating results could be adversely affected. Customer attributes that impact pricing include, in no particular order, frequency of payment by the customer to its employees, complexity of the compensation plans, value of the employee\u2019s compensation, value of the product or service that the employee is selling and the number of payees.\nBecause our long-term growth strategy involves further expansion of our sales to customers outside the U.S., our business will be increasingly susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nA component of our growth strategy involves the further expansion of our operations and customer base internationally. For the years ended January 31, 2016 and 2015, revenue generated outside of the U.S. was approximately 10% and 8%, respectively, of our total revenue. In addition, a number of our customers are U.S. companies with employees abroad, and we estimate that approximately 31% of our subscribers are located outside of the U.S., based on a representative sample of our user logins during the last two months of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016. We currently have international offices outside of the U.S. in the United Kingdom for sales and marketing and support and India for research and development, support and professional services. In the future, we may expand to other international locations. Our current international operations and future initiatives will involve a variety of risks, including:\n\u00b7\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes or trade laws;\n\u00b7\nmore stringent regulations relating to data security and the unauthorized use of, or access to, commercial and personal information, particularly in the European Union (EU), including, in certain jurisdictions such as Germany, the requirement to locate our data in data centers in such jurisdiction;\n\u00b7\ndiffering labor regulations, especially in the EU, where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the U.S., including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations;\n\u00b7\nchallenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in managing a business in new markets with diverse cultures, languages, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems and regulatory systems;\n\u00b7\nincreased travel, real estate, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with international operations;\n\u00b7\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses, and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions if we choose to do so in the future;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;\n\u00b7\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors or general preferences for local vendors;\n\u00b7\nlimited or insufficient intellectual property protection;\n\u00b7\npolitical instability or terrorist activities;\n\u00b7\nexposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions; and\n\u00b7\nadverse tax burdens and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash.\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake will not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business and operating results will suffer.\nBecause we recognize revenue from subscriptions over the term of the relevant contract, downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results.\nAs a subscription-based business, we recognize revenue over the terms of each of our contracts, which are typically from one to three years. As a result, much of the revenue we report each quarter results from contracts entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a shortfall in demand for our solutions and professional services or a decline in new or renewed contracts in any one quarter may not significantly reduce our revenue for\nthat quarter but could negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in new sales or renewals of our solutions will not be reflected in full in our operating results until future periods. Our revenue recognition model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any quarter, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable term of the contracts.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and be unpredictable, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, our past results may not be indicative of our future performance, and comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. In addition to the other risks described in this filing, factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include the following:\n\u00b7\nchanges in spending on incentive compensation or sales performance management solutions by our current or prospective customers;\n\u00b7\npricing of our solutions;\n\u00b7\nacquisition of new customers and new subscribers at current customers and the sale of additional modules to current customers;\n\u00b7\ncustomer renewal rates and the number of subscribers and additional modules for which agreements are renewed;\n\u00b7\ncustomer delays in purchasing decisions in anticipation of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nbudgeting cycles of our customers;\n\u00b7\neffects of seasonal trends on our operating results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our market, including consolidation among competitors or customers;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses, particularly research and development and marketing and sales expenses (including marketing events and commissions and bonuses associated with performance), and employee benefit expenses;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of any third-party disputes, litigation or intellectual property threats or litigation;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of non-cash expenses, including stock-based compensation, goodwill impairments, unusual items and other non-cash charges;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of costs associated with recruiting and training new employees;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of cash collections from our customers and the relative mix of quarterly, semi-annual and annual billings;\n\u00b7\nthe introduction and adoption of our solutions and services in markets outside of the U.S.;\n\u00b7\nunforeseen costs and expenses related to the expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u00b7\nthe costs and timing of costs associated with our data center facilities;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the levels of our capital expenditures;\n\u00b7\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and political conditions in our markets.\nIf we are unable to maintain, develop and grow our relationships with platform partners, or if we do not or cannot maintain the compatibility of our solutions with third-party applications that our customers use, our business will suffer.\nWe integrate our solutions with third-party applications and platforms. Our platform partners include Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, and Workday. Our APIs allow our customers to integrate our solutions into their existing business processes and systems. Our customers use our APIs to import data into our solutions from CRM, ERP, HCM and CPQ solutions, such as those provided by Microsoft, Workday and our platform partners, as well as to extract data from our solutions for use in CRM, finance and payroll solutions. The functionality and popularity of our incentive compensation and employee and sales performance management solutions depends, in part, on our ability to integrate our solutions with these third-party applications and platforms. Any deterioration in our relationship with any third-party applications provider or platform partner would harm our business and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business may be harmed if any platform partner:\n\u00b7\ndiscontinues or limits our access to its APIs;\n\u00b7\nterminates or does not allow us to renew or replace our contractual relationship;\n\u00b7\nmodifies its terms of service or other policies, including fees charged to, or other restrictions on, us or other application developers, or changes how customer information or other data may be accessed by us, our customers, or other application developers;\n\u00b7\nestablishes more favorable relationships with one or more of our competitors, or acquires one or more of our competitors and offers competing services; or\n\u00b7\notherwise develops its own competitive offerings.\nIn addition, we have benefited from these platform partners\u2019 brand recognition, reputations, referrals and customer bases. Any losses or shifts in the referrals from or the market position of these platform partners in general, in relation to one another or to new competitors or new technologies could lead to losses in our relationships or customers, or our need to identify or transition to alternative channels for marketing our solutions.\nThird-party providers of applications may change their APIs or the features of their applications and platforms, restrict our access to their applications and platforms or alter the terms governing use of their applications and APIs and access to those applications and platforms in an adverse manner. Such changes could functionally limit or terminate our ability to use these third-party applications and platforms in conjunction with our solutions, which could negatively impact our offerings and harm our business. If we fail to integrate our solutions with new third-party applications and platforms that our customers use, we may not be able to offer the functionality that our customers need, which would negatively impact our ability to reach our prospective customers and generate revenue and adversely impact our business.\nOur development of solutions is costly, and our current development efforts may not produce successful solutions and may achieve delayed, or lower than expected, benefits, which could harm our operating results.\nIn order to remain competitive, we must continue to develop new solutions and modules and enhancements to our existing solutions. Maintaining adequate research and development personnel and resources to meet the demands of the market is essential. If we are unable to develop high-quality solutions for any reason, such as high employee turnover, lack of management ability or a lack of other research and development resources, we may miss market opportunities. Further, our competitors may expend a considerably greater amount of funds on their research and development programs, and those that do not may be acquired by larger companies that could allocate greater resources to our competitors\u2019 research and development programs. Our failure to maintain adequate research and development resources or to compete effectively with the research and development programs of our competitors could materially adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, because our service is designed to operate on a variety of network hardware and software platforms using a standard browser or our mobile applications, we will need to continuously modify and enhance\nour service to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser, database and mobile technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in timely bringing them to market. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of our service to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our service, result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business.\nInterruptions to or degraded performance of our solutions or cloud-based data centers managed by us or third parties could result in customer dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, loss of customers, limited growth and reduction in revenue.\nWe currently serve our customers from data centers located in Virginia and California, with most of these data center operations managed by third parties, and some managed by us beginning in April 2015. The continuous availability of our service depends on the operations of those facilities, on a variety of network service providers, on third-party vendors and on our own data center operations staff. In addition, we depend on our operations staff and our third-party facility providers\u2019 ability to protect these facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts, cyber-attacks and similar events. If there are any lapses of service or damage to a facility, we could experience lengthy interruptions in our service as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging new facilities and services. Even with current and planned disaster recovery arrangements, which, to date, have not been tested in an actual crisis and may not cover all forms of disaster and crisis, our business could be harmed.\nWe designed our system infrastructure and own, lease or contract through managed service providers the hardware used for our services. Design and mechanical errors, spikes in usage volume and failure to follow operations protocols and procedures could cause interruptions in our service or our systems to fail. Any interruptions or delays in our service, whether as a result of third-party error, our own error, natural disasters, criminal acts, security breaches or other causes, whether accidental or willful, could harm our relationships with customers, harm our reputation and cause our revenue to decrease and/or our expenses to increase. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. These factors in turn could further reduce our revenue, subject us to liability and cause us to issue credits or cause customers not to renew their subscriptions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe have historically had limited experience managing data center operations ourselves, and we may lack the required expertise to manage these new operations effectively. We may have difficulty recruiting or retaining qualified personnel who can provide such data center management services. Also, the third-party managers of our other data center operations are under no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to move to new data centers, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruptions in connection with such a move.\nIf our software fails due to defects or similar problems, and if we fail to correct any defect or other software problems, we could lose customers, become subject to service performance or warranty claims, incur significant costs or our reputation could be damaged.\nOur solutions and the systems infrastructure underlying our platform are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors. We have from time to time found defects in our solutions and may discover additional defects in the future. We may not be able to detect and correct defects or errors before customers begin to use our solutions. Consequently, we or our customers may discover defects or errors after our solutions have been implemented. These defects or errors could also cause inaccuracies in the data we collect, process or produce for our customers, or even the loss, damage or inadvertent release of such confidential or personal data. Any problem in connection with our regularly-scheduled system maintenance may lead to unplanned system downtime. Even if we are able to implement the bug fixes and upgrades in a timely manner, any defects or inaccuracies in the data we collect, process or produce for our customers, or the loss, damage, unauthorized access to or inadvertent release of such confidential or personal data could expose us to substantial liability and cause our reputation to be harmed, could lead to customers electing not to purchase or renew their agreements with us and subject us to service performance credits, warranty claims or increased insurance costs. The costs associated with any material defects,\nerrors or other performance problems in or affecting in our solutions or the systems underlying our platform may be substantial and could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nOur efforts to market and sell solutions to small, emerging companies may not be successful which may lead to greater expenses and lower revenue.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain customers that are small, emerging companies, such as those we target with our Xactly Incent Express product. These customers are challenging to reach, acquire and retain in a cost-effective manner. Selling to and retaining these smaller companies can be more difficult than selling to and retaining large enterprise customers because smaller companies generally have high business failure rates, are price-sensitive, are difficult to reach with targeted sales campaigns, have lower renewal rates and generate less revenue. In addition, smaller companies frequently have limited budgets and may choose to spend funds on items other than our solutions. If these organizations experience economic hardship, they may be unwilling or unable to expend resources on technology software and services. If we are unable to market and sell our solutions to these smaller companies with competitive pricing and in a cost-effective manner, our ability to grow our revenue will be harmed.\nOur implementation cycles can be long and encounter unforeseen complications with customer integrations of our solutions. Any delay with our implementations could lead to increased costs and dissatisfied customers.\nWe may face unexpected challenges with some customers or more complicated implementations of our solutions with such customers. It may be difficult or expensive to implement our solutions if a customer has unexpected data, hardware or software technology challenges, or complex or unanticipated business requirements. Any difficulties or delays in the initial implementation could cause customers to delay or forego future purchases of our solutions, in which case our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOur use of distributed product development, support and professional services may prove difficult to manage to allow us to produce new solutions and services and provide professional services in order to drive growth.\nCertain of our engineering services for product development, customer technical support and professional consulting services are performed in remote offices including our subsidiary located in India. Our use of distributed personnel to perform new product and services development, and provide support and professional consulting efforts has required, and will continue to require, detailed technical and logistical coordination. We must ensure that our distributed personnel are aware of and understand development specifications and customer support, implementation and configuration requirements and that they can meet applicable timelines or, if they are not met, that any delays are not significant. We may not be able to maintain acceptable standards of quality in support, product development and professional services. If we are unable to retain or attract personnel in our distributed locations our attempts to drive growth through new solutions and margin improvements in technical support and professional services may be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWeakened U.S. and global economic conditions may harm our industry, business and operating results, including as a result of decreasing demand for our solutions by our customers.\nOur overall performance depends in part on U.S. and worldwide economic conditions, especially as the macroeconomic environment impacts our customers. Key economies have experienced downturns in the past in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These conditions may affect the rate of information technology spending generally and could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase our solutions and professional services, delay prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, or affect renewal rates, all of which could adversely affect our operating results. In particular, if any such economic slowdown disproportionately impacts any particular industry verticals of our customers, we may face diminished demand for our solutions or a contraction of subscribers and modules, which would significantly harm our revenue and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to scale our business quickly enough to meet our customers\u2019 growing needs and if we are not able to grow efficiently, our operating results could be harmed.\nAs usage of our incentive compensation and employee and sales performance management solutions grows, we will need to devote additional resources to improving our platform architecture, integrating with third-party systems and maintaining infrastructure performance. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business systems and our customer support and professional services organization to serve our enterprise customers and our growing customer base. We will also need to scale our network of partners, including hiring and contracting with additional third-party service providers, as well as scale our data center capabilities. Any failure of or delay in these efforts could cause impaired system performance and reduced customer satisfaction. These issues could reduce the attractiveness of our solutions to customers, resulting in decreased sales to new customers, lower renewal rates by existing customers, the issuance of service credits or requested refunds, which could impede our revenue growth and harm our reputation. Even if we are able to upgrade our systems and expand our staff, any such expansion will be expensive and could be complex, requiring management time and attention. We could also face inefficiencies or operational failures as a result of our efforts to scale our infrastructure. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with upgrading, improving and expanding our information technology systems. We cannot be sure that the expansion and improvements to our infrastructure and systems will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all. These efforts may reduce revenue and our margins and adversely affect our operating results.\nFailure to effectively develop and expand our marketing and sales capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our solutions.\nOur ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our incentive compensation and employee and sales performance management solutions will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our marketing and sales operations. We plan to continue expanding our sales force and third-party partners, both domestically and internationally. These efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources. In addition, the cost to acquire customers is high due to these marketing and sales efforts. Our business will be seriously harmed if our efforts do not generate a correspondingly significant increase in revenue. We may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel, if our new sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time or if our sales and marketing programs are not otherwise effective.\nWe engage partners to promote, sell, integrate and support our solutions, and we intend to seek expansion of our international partner network. Any failure to effectively develop and manage this distribution channel could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from the sale of our solutions.\nWe rely on third-party service providers to provide certain services to us and/or our customers, as well as indirect sales partners to pursue additional channel and agency distribution partnerships. Our future growth in revenue and ability to achieve and sustain profitability depends, in part, on our ability to identify, establish and retain successful third-party service provider relationships, including internationally, which will take significant time and resources and involve significant risk. If any of these third-party service providers stop supporting our solution or if our network of providers does not expand, we will likely have to expand our internal team to meet the needs of our customers, which could increase our operating costs and result in lower margins. To the extent that we are unable to recruit alternative partners, or to expand our internal team, our revenue and operating results would be harmed.\nIf we fail to maintain our thought leadership position in incentives and employee performance, our business may suffer.\nWe believe that maintaining our thought leadership position in incentives and employee performance is an important element in attracting new customers. We devote significant resources to developing and maintaining our thought leadership position, with a focus on identifying and interpreting emerging trends in incentive compensation, shaping and guiding industry dialogue, and creating and sharing proposed best practices. Our activities related to developing and maintaining our thought leadership may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in such effort. We rely upon the continued services of our management and employees with domain expertise in incentives and employee performance, and the loss of any key\nmanagement or employees in this area could harm our competitive position and reputation. If we fail to successfully grow and maintain our thought leadership position, or incur substantial expenses in our attempts to do so, we may not attract enough new customers or retain our existing customers, and our business could suffer.\nWe rely on our management team and other key employees, and the loss of one or more key employees could harm our business.\nOur success and future growth depend upon the continued services of our management team, including Christopher Cabrera, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, and other key employees in the areas of research and development, marketing, sales, services and general and administrative functions. From time to time, there may be changes in our management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. We also are dependent on the continued service of our existing software engineers and our key sales personnel. We may terminate any employee\u2019s employment at any time, with or without cause, and any employee may resign at any time, with or without cause. In addition, our executive officers and certain other management-level employees benefit from change of control severance agreements in which an involuntary termination by us without cause or a voluntary termination by the employee for good reason within one year after a change of control transaction, will result in acceleration of equity vesting and cash severance payments for the individual, which would increase the cost to us of any such departure. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees. The loss of one or more of our key employees could harm our business.\nThe failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could prevent us from executing our business strategy.\nTo execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. In particular, we compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in designing, developing and managing cloud-based software, as well as for skilled sales and operations professionals, and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the professionals we need. Also, sales compensation management experts and enterprise sales professionals are very important to our success and are difficult to replace. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the future, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly-skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. In particular, we have experienced a very competitive hiring environment in the San Francisco Bay Area, where we are headquartered. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we do. In addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in the software industry, job candidates often consider the value of the stock options or other equity incentives they are to receive in connection with their employment. It may be more difficult to attract new employees, some of whom may prefer to work for a private company with the possibility of a future initial public offering. If the price of our stock does not increase, or experiences significant volatility, our ability to attract or retain key employees may be adversely affected. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our growth prospects could be severely harmed.\nIf we fail to enhance our brand, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our financial condition may suffer.\nWe believe that our development of the Xactly brand is important to achieving awareness of our existing and future incentive compensation and employee and sales performance management solutions, and, as a result, is important to attracting new customers, maintaining existing customers and continuing our relationship with key platform partners. We also believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful incentive compensation and employee and sales performance management solutions at competitive prices. In the past, our efforts to build our brand have involved significant expenses. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand.\nIf we fail to forecast our revenue accurately, or if we fail to match our expenditures with corresponding revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nBecause our recent growth has resulted in the expansion of our business, we do not have a long history upon which to base forecasts of future operating revenue. In addition, for our enterprise customers, the lengthy sales cycle for the evaluation and implementation of our solutions, which typically extends for several months, may also cause us to experience a delay between increasing operating expenses for such sales efforts, and, upon successful sales, the generation of corresponding revenue. Accordingly, we may be unable to prepare accurate internal financial forecasts or replace anticipated revenue that we do not receive as a result of delays arising from these factors. As a result, our operating results in future reporting periods may be significantly below the expectations of equity research analysts or investors, which could harm the price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to offer high-quality professional services and customer support, our business and reputation would suffer.\nHigh-quality professional services and customer support are important for the successful marketing and sale of our solutions, the renewal of existing customers, the addition of subscribers at existing customers and the sale of additional solutions to existing customers. Providing these professional services requires that our customer support personnel and implementation partners have specific incentive compensation and employee and sales performance management knowledge and expertise, making it more difficult for us to hire qualified personnel and to scale up our support operations due to the extensive training required. The importance of high-quality performance services and customer support will increase as we expand our business and pursue new customers. Also, as we rely more on our implementation partners to deliver our solutions to our customers and provide necessary support, our ability to manage and ensure the successful implementation of our solutions will be further limited. If we or our implementation partners fail to help our customers effectively implement our solutions, resolve post-deployment issues and provide ongoing support, our ability to sell additional functionality and professional services to existing customers may suffer and our reputation with existing or potential customers may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position, ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expense to enforce our rights.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon our proprietary technology and content, including software, databases, confidential information and know-how, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our solutions and services. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Any of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged, infringed, misappropriated, or circumvented by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. The steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation or misuse of our intellectual property, or deter independent development of similar intellectual property by others. Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property or technology. Some aspects of our business and services also rely on technologies, software and content developed by or licensed from third parties, and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with such third parties or enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nWhile we have one issued U.S. patent and five U.S. patent applications pending, those applications and any patent applications that we may file in the future may not result in issued patents, and we may be unable to obtain protection for the covered technology. In addition, any patents issued or other intellectual property may not provide us with competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged or invalidated by third parties through administrative process or litigation. Effective trademark, trade secret, patent, copyright and domain name protection is expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and the costs of defending our rights. Furthermore, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights are uncertain. Additional uncertainty may result from changes to intellectual property\nlegislation enacted in the U.S. and elsewhere, and from interpretations of intellectual property laws by applicable courts and agencies. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our solutions or to use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours. Some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our solutions may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions. In addition, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our solutions and proprietary information may increase. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights, including as counterclaims to any intellectual property litigation. Litigation is inherently uncertain, and any litigation, whether as a plaintiff or defendant and whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and the invalidation or narrowing of the scope of our intellectual property and could divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel.\nWe have been and may in the future be sued by third parties for various claims including alleged infringement of proprietary rights.\nWe have been and may in the future be involved in various legal matters arising from our business activities. Such future actions may include claims, suits, government investigations and other proceedings alleging that we, our customers, our licensees, or parties indemnified by us have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated the intellectual property rights or other rights of third parties, or have violated commercial, corporate and securities, labor and employment, wage and hour, and other laws and regulations. For example, we may be subject to claims that we are infringing the patent, trademark or copyright rights of third parties, or that our employees have misappropriated or divulged their former employers\u2019 trade secrets or confidential information.\nThe cloud-based and business-to-business software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. For example, we settled intellectual property and related litigation with one of our competitors in 2013. We have received, and in the future may receive, communications from third parties, including practicing entities and non-practicing entities, claiming that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated their proprietary rights or intellectual property.\nWe expect that software and other solutions in our industry increasingly may be subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of solutions in different industry segments overlaps. Moreover, many of our competitors and other industry participants have been issued patents and/or have filed patent applications, and have asserted claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these companies, have asserted patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights within the industry. Any of these third parties might in the future make a claim of infringement against us.\nWe and our customers or partners may in the future be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their claimed proprietary rights. Our technologies may be subject to injunction if they are found to infringe the rights of a third party or we may be required to pay damages, or both. Many of our agreements with customers and partners require us to indemnify them for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim.\nThe outcome of any claims or litigation, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain. Any claims and lawsuits, and the disposition of such claims and lawsuits, whether through settlement or licensing discussions, or litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive to resolve, divert management attention from executing our business plan, result in efforts to enjoin our activities, lead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims, adversely affect our relationships with our current or future customers and partners, cause delays or stoppages in providing our services, necessitate incurring significant legal fees and, in the case of intellectual property claims, require us to change our technology, change our business practices and/or pay monetary damages or enter into short- or long-term royalty or licensing agreements. Some claimants may have substantially greater resources, including larger patent portfolios, than we do and may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual\nproperty litigation to a greater degree and for longer periods of time than we could. In addition, patent holding companies that focus on extracting royalties and settlements by enforcing patent rights may target us. Liability for monetary damages against us may be tripled and may include attorneys\u2019 fees, or, in some circumstances, damages against our customers and partners, and we may be prohibited from developing, commercializing or continuing to provide some or all of our services unless we obtain licenses from, and pay royalties to, the holders of the patents or other intellectual property rights, which may not be available on commercially favorable terms, or at all.\nAny adverse determination related to intellectual property claims or other litigation could prevent us from offering our services to others, could be material to our financial condition or cash flows, or both, or could otherwise adversely affect our operating results. In addition, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute, an unfavorable resolution of a legal matter could materially affect our future results of operation or cash flows or both.\nIn addition, our exposure to risks associated with various claims, including the use of intellectual property, may be increased as a result of acquisitions of other companies, or as we expand the complexity, scope and public profile of our business. For example, we may have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to intellectual property or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks with respect to the acquired company or technology. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.\nWe use open source software in our solutions, which could subject us to litigation or other actions.\nWe use open source software in our platform and we intend to continue to use open source software in the future. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products or alleging that these companies have violated the terms of an open source license. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or alleging that we have violated the terms of an open source license. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our solutions. In addition, if we were to combine our proprietary software solutions with open source software in certain manners, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to publicly release the source code of our proprietary software solutions. If we inappropriately use open source software, we may be required to re-engineer our solutions, discontinue the sale of our solutions, release the source code of our proprietary software to the public at no cost or take other remedial actions. Although we have taken steps to control our use of open source software, many open source licenses have not been interpreted by courts, and we cannot be certain that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products have been or will be effective. There is a risk that open source licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf our security measures or those of our customers are compromised or unauthorized access to customer data is otherwise obtained, our solutions may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or cease their use of our solutions, our reputation may be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities.\nOur operations involve the storage and transmission of customer data, including, in some cases, personally identifiable information, and any unauthorized access to, loss of or unauthorized disclosure of this information, as a result of a security incident, employee, customer or partner error, malfeasance, stolen or fraudulently obtained log-in credentials or otherwise could result in litigation, substantial liability, regulatory investigations or fines, indemnity obligations and other possible liabilities, as well as negative publicity, any of which could damage our reputation, impair our sales and harm our business. Cyber-attacks and other malicious internet-based activity continue to increase generally, and cloud-based platform providers have been targeted. In addition, if the security measures of any of our customers or platform partners are compromised, even without any actual compromise of our own systems, we may face substantial liability or negative publicity or reputational harm if our customers, platform partners or anyone else incorrectly attributes the blame for such security breaches to us or our systems. We may be unable to anticipate or prevent techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage our systems because they change frequently and generally are not detected until after an incident has occurred. As we increase our customer base and our brand becomes more widely known and recognized, we may become more of a target for third parties seeking to compromise our security systems or gain unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 data.\nMany governments have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data. In addition, some of our customers contractually require notification of any data security compromise. Security compromises experienced by our competitors, by our platform partners, by our customers or by us may lead to public disclosures, which may lead to widespread negative publicity. Any security compromise in our industry, whether actual or perceived, could harm our reputation, erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our security measures, negatively impact our ability to attract new customers, cause existing customers to elect not to renew their subscriptions or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe limitations of liability provisions in our contracts and our insurance coverage may not be enforceable or adequate.\nThere can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim, including any intellectual property claims, claims relating to a data security breach, or other claims for which we must indemnify our customers or partners. We also cannot be sure that our existing general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors or omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nData usage limitations, privacy and data protection concerns, evolving regulation of the internet, cross-border data transfers and other domestic or foreign regulations may limit the use and adoption of our solutions and adversely affect our business.\nOur customers can use our solutions to store contact and other personal or identifying information regarding some of their employees. As internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign governments and agencies becomes more likely. For example, increased regulation is occurring in the areas of data privacy and data protection, both in the U.S. and internationally, and privacy- and data security-related regulatory obligations are evolving. New and modified laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing, use and security of personal information could affect our or our customers\u2019 ability to use data, potentially reducing demand for our solutions, imposing greater compliance burdens on us or our customers and restricting our ability to store, process and share data with our customers.\nWe use our customers\u2019 data in an aggregated and anonymized format for our solutions. Privacy and data protection-related concerns may cause our customers\u2019 employees or contacts to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our solutions effectively. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our solutions in certain industries and in certain countries.\nWe may be subject to future foreign regulation requiring data collected or used within such foreign jurisdiction to reside there. Foreign data privacy laws and regulations, such as the EU\u2019s Data Protection Directive, and the country-specific laws and regulations that implement the directive, also govern the processing of personally identifiable data, and may be stricter than U.S. laws. The EU currently is anticipated to formally adopt a General Data Protection Regulation, to supersede the Data Protection Directive in 2018, which would cause EU data privacy laws to be more stringent and to provide for greater penalties for noncompliance. Additionally, with regard to transfers of personal data from Europe to the U.S., we historically relied on the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as agreed to by the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the EU and Switzerland, which established means for complying with certain restrictions on the transfer of personal data by U.S. companies from the EEA and Switzerland to the U.S. The Court of Justice of the EU recently issued a ruling invalidating the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework as a method of complying with restrictions in the EU Data Protection Directive (and member states\u2019 implementations thereof) regarding the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA. We are in the process of implementing appropriate changes to our practices with respect to personal data as a result of this ruling, and this ruling may serve as a basis for our personal data handling practices, or those of our customers, to be challenged and may otherwise adversely impact our business. More recently, the U.S. and the EU reached agreement upon a new\ndata transfer framework referred to as the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield, designed to replace the invalidated U.S.-EU Safe Harbor. The U.S.-EU Privacy Shield still faces reviews and other requirements before becoming effective. It is not clear that the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield will be formally adopted or that we will find it appropriate to utilize as a mechanism to legitimize data transfers from the EEA to the U.S. We are engaging in other measures to legitimize our transfers of personal data from the EEA to the U.S. in the interim. As a result of the Court of Justice of the EU\u2019s recent ruling, or if other restrictions are adopted by the EU or other jurisdictions upon the transfer of personal data to the U.S., we may have to create duplicative, and potentially expensive, information technology infrastructure and business operations in other jurisdictions, which may hinder our expansion plans in those jurisdictions or render such plans commercially infeasible. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws and regulations that are applicable to us or to the businesses of our customers may be substantial and may limit the use and adoption of our solutions and reduce overall demand, may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could compromise our ability to effectively pursue our growth strategy, or may lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance with such privacy laws or regulations.\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new or additional self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our customers or on us. If the gathering of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner, our solutions would be less effective and we would be required to work with our customers to modify such information on our solutions, which may reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business.\nWe may expand through acquisitions of, or investments in, other companies, which may divert our management\u2019s attention and result in additional dilution to our stockholders, and we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions.\nWe may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our solutions, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not the acquisitions are completed. In addition, we have limited experience in acquiring other businesses, having acquired one company in 2009. If we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies, maintain relationships with customers or partners or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We may not be able to find and identify desirable acquisition targets or be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target. We also may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities, or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product, or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, solution quality or architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee or client issues. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could impact our cash flows and subject us to restrictive covenants that could inhibit our business, any of which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations or if we are unable to successfully integrate it, our business and operating results may suffer.\nWe may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or research tax credit carryforwards, which could adversely affect our future liquidity position.\nAs of January 31, 2016, we had approximately $213.8 million and $69.8 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, which if not utilized will begin to expire in 2019 for federal purposes and began to expire in 2015 for state purposes. These net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could require additional cash expenditures for income taxes in the future. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code), our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d Under Section 382 of the Code, an \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50% over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. It is possible that prior ownership changes or any future ownership change could have a material effect on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes.\nWe are leveraged financially, which could adversely affect our ability to adjust our business to respond to competitive pressures and to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our future research and development needs, to protect and enforce our intellectual property, and to meet other needs.\nAs of January 31, 2016, we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately $15.9 million drawn under various credit facilities.\nThe degree to which we are leveraged could have negative consequences, including the following:\n\u00b7\nwe may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, less able to withstand competitive pressures and less flexible in responding to changing business and economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, litigation, general corporate or other purposes may be limited; and\n\u00b7\na substantial portion of our cash flows from operations in the future may be required for the payment of the principal amount of our existing indebtedness when it becomes due at maturity, which is currently scheduled for October 2018, with respect to indebtedness under the Amended SVB Agreement (as defined below) and September 2019 with respect to the SVB Term Loan (as defined below).\nA failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of our credit agreements could result in events of default under such agreements, which could permit acceleration of all of our outstanding indebtedness. Any required repayment of the principal amount of our existing indebtedness as a result of a fundamental change or acceleration of our existing indebtedness would reduce our cash on hand such that we would not have those funds available for use in our business.\nFinancing agreements to which we are party or may become party may contain operating and financial covenants that restrict our business and financing activities.\nOur existing credit facilities with certain lenders contain certain operating and financial restrictions and covenants, including a prohibition on the incurrence of certain indebtedness and liens, a prohibition on certain investments, a prohibition on paying dividends on our common stock, restrictions against certain merger and consolidation transactions, certain restrictions against the disposition of assets and the requirement to maintain a minimum level of liquidity. These restrictions and covenants, as well as those contained in any future financing agreements that we may enter into, restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in, expand or otherwise pursue our business activities and strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and breaches of these covenants could result in a default under our credit agreements and any future financing agreements that we may enter into. If not waived, defaults could cause our outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreement and any future financing agreements that we may enter into to become immediately due and payable.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value-added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe do not collect sales and use, value-added and similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales of our solutions or related services where we do not believe that such taxes are applicable. Sales and use, value-added and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements may adversely affect the results of our operations.\nWe may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nWe are potentially exposed to adverse movements in currency exchange rates. Although most of our revenue and expenses occur in U.S. dollars, some occur in local currencies, such as the United Kingdom and India, and the amounts in local currency may increase as we expand our international operations. An increase in the value of the\nU.S. dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the U.S., and a weakened U.S. dollar could increase the cost of our expenses, as well as overseas capital expenditures. We have not engaged in hedging transactions to reduce exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\nViolations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-bribery laws could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions prohibit companies and their intermediaries and agents from making improper payments to foreign officials, including employees of government owned businesses, as well as private organizations, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. During the last few years, the United States Department of Justice and the SEC have brought an increasing number of FCPA enforcement cases, many resulting in very large fines and deferred criminal prosecutions.\nWe have anti-corruption policies in effect to mandate compliance with the FCPA and other similar anti-bribery laws and expect to design and implement a plan that seeks to ensure compliance with those policies. However, there can be no assurance that our employees and third-party intermediaries will comply with the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws and the policies that we implement to seek to ensure compliance with them. Violations of the FCPA or other foreign anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and cause us to suffer civil and criminal financial penalties and other sanctions, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruption by manmade problems such as network security breaches, computer viruses or terrorism.\nWe rely heavily on our data centers, network infrastructure and information technology systems for our business operations. A disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a terrorist attack, online or hacker attack, earthquake, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, or other similar catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, delays in accessing our service, reputational harm and loss of critical data or could prevent us from providing our solutions to our customers. Our service is delivered from data centers operated by a third party in Virginia and California. In addition, we are headquartered and most of our employees reside in the San Francisco Bay Area, an area susceptible to earthquakes, and a major earthquake or other catastrophic event could affect our employees, who may not be able to access our systems or otherwise continue to provide our solutions to our customers. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers, or our network infrastructure or information technology systems, or access to our systems, could affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance and could subject us to litigation.\nThe trading prices of the securities of technology companies, including providers of cloud-based software, have been highly volatile. The market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations. Factors affecting the market price of our stock, many of which are beyond our control, include:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results, including as a result of the addition or loss of customers;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u00b7\nfailure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in ratings and financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of cloud-based software or other technology companies, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u00b7\nprice and volume fluctuations in the trading of our common stock and in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us with regard to the effectiveness of our internal controls and our ability to accurately report financial results;\n\u00b7\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business or our industry;\n\u00b7\nlawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u00b7\nchanges in key personnel; and\n\u00b7\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.\nIn the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price for our common stock could decline as a result of the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, a large number of shares of our common stock becoming available for sale or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares. As of January 31, 2016, we have outstanding 29,542,537 shares of common stock.\nHolders of a significant number of shares of our common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or our stockholders.\nIn addition, the shares of common stock subject to outstanding options under our equity incentive plans and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish incorrect or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. If no or few securities or industry analysts cover our company, the trading price for our stock would be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes incorrect or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit your ability to influence corporate matters, including the ability to influence the outcome of director elections and other matters requiring stockholder approval.\nOur executive officers, directors, current 5% or greater stockholders and affiliated entities together beneficially own approximately 55.1% of our common stock outstanding based on shares outstanding as of January 31, 2016. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, have significant influence over all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Corporate action might be taken even if other stockholders oppose them. This concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing.\nOur business and operations may consume resources faster than we anticipate. In the future, we may need to raise additional funds to invest in future growth opportunities. Additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to invest in future growth opportunities, which could seriously harm our business and operating results. If we incur debt, the debt holders would have rights senior to common stockholders to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations, including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity securities, stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their interest.\nThe requirements of being a public company will subject us to increased costs and may strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange. The requirements of these rules and regulations will increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, will make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems and resources.\nThe Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing the costly process of implementing and testing our systems to report our results as a public company, to continue to manage our growth and to implement internal controls. We will be required to implement and maintain various other control and business systems related to our equity, finance, treasury, information technology, other recordkeeping systems and other operations. As a result of this implementation and maintenance, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, we rely on third-party software and system providers for ensuring our reporting obligations and effective internal controls, and to the extent these third parties fail to provide adequate service including as a result of any inability to scale to handle our growth and the imposition of these increased reporting and internal controls and procedures, we could incur material costs for upgrading or switching systems and our business could be materially affected.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time-consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in\nincreased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we expect these laws, rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain appropriate levels of coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the time and resources of our management and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAs a result of becoming a public company, we are obligated to further develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe will be required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with our annual report covering the fiscal year ending January 31, 2017. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. Prior to our initial public offering (IPO), we have never been required to test our internal controls within a specified period, and, as a result, we may experience difficulty in meeting these reporting requirements in a timely manner. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC, or the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Act (JOBS Act). If we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nImplementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may require specific compliance training of our directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs in order to modify our existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase our operating costs and could materially impair our ability to operate our business. In the event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, that our internal controls are perceived as inadequate or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results and our stock price could decline.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced financial disclosure obligations, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these provisions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d upon the earliest to occur of: the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenue; the date we qualify as a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; the issuance, in any three-year period, by us of more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; and the last day of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced reporting burdens. If we take advantage of any of these reduced reporting burdens in future filings, the information that we provide our security holders may be different than you might get from other public companies in which you hold equity interests. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have chosen to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future. In addition, the Amended SVB Agreement and the SVB Term Loan prohibit us from paying cash dividends, and future financing or credit agreements may contain similar restrictions. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. Consequently, investors may need to sell all or part of their holdings of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u00b7\nauthorize \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by the board without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u00b7\ncreate a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u00b7\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of the board, the chief executive officer or the president;\n\u00b7\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent;\n\u00b7\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nprovide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u00b7\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u00b7\nspecify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors;\n\u00b7\nauthorize our board of directors to modify, alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u00b7\nrequire supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our charter documents.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us in certain circumstances.\nAny provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 15485, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "XTLY"}
