{"cik": "1592329", "company": "Clifton Bancorp Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-06-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in shares of our common stock involves various risks. Before deciding to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K and information incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following risks or by other risks that have not been identified or that we may believe are immaterial or unlikely. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nChanges in interest rates may hurt our profits and asset value and our strategies for managing interest rate risk may not be effective.\nWe are subject to significant interest rate risk as a financial institution with a high percentage of fixed rate loans and certificates of deposit on our balance sheet. During the past several years, it has been the policy of the Federal Reserve Board to maintain interest rates at historically low levels. As a result, recent market rates on the loans we have originated and the yields on securities we have purchased have been at relatively low levels. Our interest-bearing liabilities, on the other hand, likely will reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets, much of which has been booked relatively recently. Accordingly, if market interest rates increase, our net interest income may be adversely affected and may decrease, which may have an adverse effect on our future\nprofitability. Specifically, at March 31, 2017, in the event of a 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would be expected to experience a 28.2% decrease in net portfolio value and a $1.3 million, or 3.9%, decrease in net interest income. Our primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income by affecting the difference between the weighted-average yield earned on our interest-earning assets and the weighted-average rate paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, or interest rate spread, and the average life of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in interest rates also can affect: (1) our ability to originate loans; (2) the value of our interest-earning assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets; (3) our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives; and (4) the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, particularly adjustable or variable rate loans. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including government monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control.\nOur earnings may be negatively impacted as a result of our plans to grow and diversify our loan portfolio.\nOur strategy to grow and diversify our loan portfolio by increasing our multi-family and commercial real estate lending activities has resulted, and will continue to result, in increased operating expenses, mainly associated with the hiring of personnel and the addition of appropriate infrastructure. These expenses will relate to salaries and employee benefits for additional staff, increased marketing efforts, investment in technology and developing our deposit products to better serve business customers. Over time, we anticipate that we will generate additional income related to this growth and diversification strategy.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our results of operations would be negatively affected.\nIn determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we analyze our loss and delinquency experience by loan categories and we consider the effect of existing economic conditions. In addition, we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. If the results of our analyses are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would require additions to our allowance and would decrease our net income. This risk is heightened by the lack of seasoning in our multi-family and commercial real estate portfolios, which have grown materially in the past year. Our emphasis on loan growth and on increasing our portfolio of multi-family and commercial real estate loans, as well any future credit deterioration, will require us to increase our allowance further in the future.\nIn addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses and could require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur increase in multi-family and commercial real estate lending exposes us to increased lending risks and related loan losses.\nFrom March 31, 2016 to March 31, 2017 our multi-family and commercial portfolio increased $140.8 million. Our current business strategy is to continue to increase our originations of multi-family and commercial real estate loans. Multi-family and commercial real estate loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the properties and the income stream of the borrowers. These loans involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Further, we may increase our loans to individual borrowers, which would result in larger loan balances. To the extent that borrowers have more than one multi-family or commercial loan outstanding, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship could expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to four-family residential real estate loan. Moreover, if loans that are\ncollateralized by multi-family or commercial real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nIt is difficult for us to assess the future performance of newly originated multi-family and commercial real estate loans because our relatively limited experience in this type of lending does not provide us with a significant payment history from which to judge future collectability, especially under different, less robust economic environments. Accordingly, these unseasoned loans may experience higher delinquency or charge-off levels than our historical loan portfolio experience, which would adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nRegulatory emphasis on commercial and multi-family real estate lending could curtail our growth.\nIn 2006, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (collectively, the \u201cAgencies\u201d) issued joint guidance entitled \u201cConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices\u201d (the \u201cCRE Guidance\u201d). Although the CRE Guidance did not establish specific lending limits, it provides that a bank\u2019s commercial real estate lending exposure could receive increased supervisory scrutiny where total non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by apartment buildings, investor commercial real estate, and construction and land loans, represent 300% or more of an institution\u2019s total risk-based capital, and the outstanding balance of the commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the preceding 36 months. Our level of non-owner occupied commercial and multi-family estate increased from 23.5% to 103.5% of total risk-based capital from March 31, 2014 to March 31, 2017. Moreover, this portfolio increased by $225.5 million, from $40.6 million to $266.1 million, for the 36 months ended March 31, 2017.\nIn December 2015, the Agencies released a new statement on prudent risk management for commercial real estate lending (the \u201c2015 Statement\u201d). In the 2015 Statement, the Agencies, among other things, indicate the intent to continue \u201cto pay special attention\u201d to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. If the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, our primary federal regulator, were to impose restriction on the amount of commercial real estate loans we can hold in our portfolio, for reasons noted above or otherwise, our earnings would be adversely affected.\nOur concentration on residential mortgage loans exposes us to risks.\nAt March 31, 2017, $702.4 million, or 69.5%, of our loan portfolio was secured by one- to four-family real estate in New Jersey and, to lesser extent, New York, and we intend to continue this type of lending in the foreseeable future. One- to four-family residential mortgage lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. The decline in residential real estate values as a result of a downturn in the local housing market has reduced (and would reduce) the value of the real estate collateral securing these types of loans. Declines in real estate values could cause some of our residential mortgages to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss if we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral.\nThe building of market share through our banking center strategy and our investments in products and services has caused our expenses to increase.\nWe opened full-service, technologically advanced banking centers in Hoboken, New Jersey in fiscal 2016 and in Montclair, New Jersey in fiscal 2017. We may also open additional banking centers in the future. There are considerable costs involved in opening banking centers, especially in light of the capabilities needed to compete in today\u2019s environment. Moreover, new banking centers generally require a period of time to generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. Accordingly, our new banking centers have negatively impacted our earnings and can be expected to do so for some period of time. Our investments in products and services, and the related personnel required to implement new policies and procedures, take time to earn returns and can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for the foreseeable future.\nOur inability to achieve profitability on new banking centers may negatively affect our earnings.\nWe have expanded our presence throughout our market area and we intend to pursue further expansion, either by de novo or through the purchase of branches from other financial institutions. The profitability of our expansion strategy will depend on whether the income that we generate from the new banking centers will offset the increased expenses resulting from operating these banking centers. We expect that it may take a period of time before these banking centers can become profitable, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. During this period, the expense of operating these banking centers may negatively affect our net income.\nOur strategy of transitioning from higher-rate non-core deposits to lower cost core deposits will take time and may not be successful.\nCore deposits, including checking and savings accounts, are a lower cost source of funds than time deposits, and we have made a concerted effort to increase lower cost transaction and savings deposit accounts and reduce our dependence on traditionally higher cost certificates of deposit. Our current strategy is to competitively price our core deposits in order to increase core deposit relationships. In addition, we have introduced new products or offer promotional deposit rates on certain deposit products in order to attract deposits. Despite our strategy, which takes time to impact results, certificates of deposit still comprise 66% of total deposits at March 31, 2017. Certificates of deposit due within one year of March 31, 2017 totaled $258.2 million, or 30.6% of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, or we are not successful in attracting lower cost core deposits, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other certificates of deposit, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, brokered deposits and lines of credit. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on maturing certificates of deposit.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers; systems failures, interruptions and security breaches could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur third-party service providers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. We likely will expend additional resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by such security breaches or viruses. To the extent that the activities of our third-party service providers or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation costs and other possible liabilities.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information about our customers and employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We, our customers, and other financial institutions with which we interact, are subject to ongoing, continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers,\norganized criminals, and in some cases, state-sponsored organizations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such unauthorized access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties; disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers; damage our reputation; and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation. We expect to expend resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses.\nWe must keep pace with technological change to remain competitive.\nFinancial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available, as well as related essential personnel. Many of our competitors have already implemented critical technologies and have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so, due to cost, proficiency or otherwise, could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.\nImprovements in technology will increase our costs and may impact our growth strategies.\nIn order to improve our technology and competitiveness, we changed our core service/data services provider during fiscal 2015. This resulted in additional data related costs. During 2016, we added new technology including mobile banking, appointment banking, local WiFi and cash recycling. Going forward, we plan to continue to update to new technologies to enhance the customer experience and ultimately increase the efficiency of our operations. We believe such technological changes are necessary to be able to effectively compete in our marketplace. Such changes will increase expenses. In addition, we may experience delays in acquisition and implementation of new technologies, which could further increase costs and adversely impact our growth strategies.\nBecause the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, we face significant operational risks.\nWe operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or outside persons, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulations, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In the event of a breakdown in the internal control system, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, and suffer damage to our reputation.\nOur dividends could be limited or eliminated.\nOur ability to pay dividends to our stockholders is based primarily upon the ability of Clifton Savings Bank to make capital distributions to Clifton Bancorp, which in turn is dependent to a significant degree on our earnings. Under the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency safe harbor regulations, Clifton Savings Bank may distribute to Clifton Bancorp capital not exceeding net income for the current calendar year and the prior two calendar years. To the extent that we fall outside the safe harbor, our ability to upstream cash to Clifton Bancorp and thus pay a dividend could be restricted or eliminated. In addition, Clifton Bancorp\u2019s dividend rate and the continued payment of dividends will depend upon a number of other factors, including tax considerations, capital requirements and alternative uses for capital, industry standards and economic conditions. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay dividends or that we will not reduce dividends in the future.\nEconomic conditions could result in increases in our level of non-performing loans and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAlthough the U.S. economy has emerged from the severe recession that occurred in 2008 and 2009, economic growth has been slow and uneven. A return to prolonged deteriorating economic conditions could significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Further, declines in real estate values and sales volumes and elevated unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in our non-performing and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Reduction in problem assets can be slow, and the process has been exacerbated by the condition of some of the properties securing non-performing loans and the lengthy foreclosure process in New Jersey. To the extent that we must work through the resolution of assets, economic problems may cause us to incur losses and adversely affect our capital, liquidity, and financial condition.\nThe geographic concentration of our loan portfolio and lending activities makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the New Jersey and New York economies.\nWhile there is not a single employer or industry in our market area on which a significant number of our customers are dependent, a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of loans secured by property located in northern New Jersey and New York, particularly New York City. This makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy and real estate markets. Adverse conditions in the local economy such as unemployment, recession, a catastrophic event or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, which could impact our net interest income. Decreases in local real estate values caused by economic conditions or other events could adversely affect the value of the property used as collateral for our loans, which could cause us to realize a loss in the event of a foreclosure.\nStrong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow growth.\nOur profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area. We face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. We continue to face stiff competition for one- to four-family residential loans from other financial service providers, including large national residential lenders and local community banks. Other competitors for one- to four-family residential loans include credit unions and mortgage brokers which keep overhead costs and mortgage rates down by selling loans and not holding or servicing them. Our competitors for multi-family and commercial real estate loans include other community banks and commercial lenders, many of which are larger than us and have greater resources and lending limits than we have and offer services that we do not provide. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits, which reduces net interest income. We expect competition to remain strong in the future.\nActs of terrorism and other external events could impact our business.\nFinancial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising operating and communication systems. Additionally, the metropolitan New York area and northern New Jersey remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism. Such events could cause significant damage, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing repayment of our loans, and result in the loss of revenue. The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nRegulation of the financial services industry is intense, and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation, supervision and examination. Such regulation, supervision and examination govern the activities in which we may engage, and are intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and Clifton Savings Bank\u2019s depositors.\nIn 2010 and 2011, in response to the financial crisis and recession that began in 2008, significant regulatory and legislative changes resulted in broad reform and increased regulation affecting financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act has created a significant shift in the way financial institutions operate and has restructured the regulation of depository institutions by merging the Office of Thrift Supervision, which previously regulated Clifton Savings Bank, into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and assigning the regulation of savings and loan holding companies to the Federal Reserve Board. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to administer consumer protection and fair lending laws, a function that was formerly performed by the depository institution regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act contains various provisions designed to enhance the regulation of depository institutions and prevent the recurrence of a financial crisis such as that which occurred in 2008 and 2009. The Dodd-Frank Act has had and may continue to have a material impact on our operations, particularly through increased regulatory burden and compliance costs. Any future legislative changes could have a material impact on our profitability, the value of assets held for investment or the value of collateral for loans. Future legislative changes could also require changes to business practices and potentially expose us to additional costs, liabilities, enforcement action and reputational risk.\nFederal regulatory agencies have the ability to take strong supervisory actions against financial institutions that have experienced increased loan production and losses and other underwriting weaknesses. These actions include the entering into of written agreements and cease and desist orders that place certain limitations on their operations. If we were to become subject to a supervisory agreement such action may negatively impact our ability to execute our business plan, and result in operational restrictions, as well as our ability to grow, pay dividends, repurchase stock or engage in mergers and acquisitions. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision-Federal Banking Regulation-Capital Requirements\u201d for a discussion of regulatory capital requirements.\nA new accounting standard will likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for Clifton Bancorp and Clifton Savings Bank for our first fiscal year after December 15, 2019. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for loan losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are probable, which would likely require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and to greatly increase the data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses, or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulations restrict our ability to originate certain residential mortgage loans.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued a rule designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid monetary damages under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that meet this \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d definition will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. Under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s rule, a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d loan must not contain certain specified features, including (i) excessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less \u201cbona fide discount points\u201d for prime loans); (ii) interest-only-payments; (iii) negative amortization; or (iv) terms longer than 30 years. Additionally, to qualify as a \u201cqualified mortgage,\u201d a borrower\u2019s total debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a\nfully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s rule on qualified mortgages limits our ability to make certain types of loans or pursue certain borrowers, and makes it more expensive/and or time consuming to make these loans, all of which could limit our growth or profitability.\nOur equity benefit plans adversely affect our profitability and will continue to do so as such benefits are granted and vest.\nWe recognize additional annual employee compensation and benefit expenses as a result of our equity incentive plan, implemented in 2015. These additional expenses are material and will continue to adversely affect our profitability.", "PERMNO": 90080, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "CSBK"}
