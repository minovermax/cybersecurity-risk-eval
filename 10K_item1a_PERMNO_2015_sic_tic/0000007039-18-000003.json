{"cik": "7039", "company": "TRECORA RESOURCES", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global petrochemical, specialty wax and mining businesses (due to our investment in AMAK). Many of these risk factors are not within our control and could adversely affect our business, our financial and operating results or our financial condition. We discuss some of these risks in more detail below in no particular order of priority.\nDependence on a limited number of customers\nDuring 2017, sales to one customer exceeded 10 percent of SHR's revenues. See the information regarding dependence on a limited number of customers set forth in Part I, Item I Business under the caption \"United States Specialty Petrochemical Operation\". The total loss of a large volume customer could adversely affect our ability to market products on a competitive basis and generate a profit.\nIntense competition\nThe Company competes in the petrochemical industry. Accordingly, we are subject to intense competition among a large number of companies, both larger and smaller than us, many of which have financial capability, facilities, personnel and other resources greater than us. In the specialty products and solvents markets, the Company has one principal competitor in North America, Phillips 66. Multiple competitors exist when searching for new business in other parts of the world. We compete primarily on the basis of performance, price, quality, reliability, reputation, distribution, service, and account relationships. If our products, services, support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria, our operations, results and prospects could be harmed. The Company has a portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product lines. As a result, we may invest less in certain areas of our businesses than competitors do, and these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources available to them than our businesses that compete against them. Industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we compete, and competitors also may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers. We may have to continue to lower the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive, while at the same time, trying to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin.\nChanges in technology\nOur ability to maintain or enhance technological capabilities, develop and market products and applications that meet changing customer requirements, and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in a cost effective and timely manner will likely impact our future business success. We compete in a number of areas including, but not limited to, product quality, performance, and customer service. Our inability to maintain a technological edge, innovate and improve our products could cause a decline in the demand and sales of our products, and adversely impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nClimate change and greenhouse gas restrictions\nDue to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These include adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards, and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. These requirements could make our products more expensive, lengthen project implementation times, and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources such as natural gas. Current and pending greenhouse gas regulations may also increase our compliance costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions.\nVarying economic conditions\nThe demand for our products and metals correlates closely with general economic growth rates. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results. Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes in population growth rates or periods of civil unrest, also impact the demand for our products and metals. Economic conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and institutions also pose risks to us, including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to us. In addition, the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied, which makes future financial results less predictable. Our revenue, gross margin and profit vary among our products, customer groups and geographic markets; and therefore, will likely be different in future periods than currently. Overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product, customer and geographic mix reflected in that period's net revenue. In addition, newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures. Market trends, competitive pressures, increased raw material or shipping costs, regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may necessitate adjustments to our operations.\nTransportation impediments\nAlthough we try to anticipate problems with supplies of raw materials by planning ahead, any significant disruption could affect our ability to obtain raw materials at affordable costs which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe maintain a number of owned trucks and trailers and leased railcars; however, we also rely upon transportation provided by third parties (including common carriers, rail companies and trans-ocean cargo companies) to deliver products to our customers. Our access to third-party transportation is not guaranteed, and we may be unable to transport our products in a timely manner in certain circumstances or at economically attractive rates. Disruptions in transportation are common. Our inability to ship products in a timely and efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChemical plant operating risks\nAs a manufacturer of diversified chemical products, our business is subject to operating risks common to chemical manufacturing, storage, handling, and transportation. These risks include, but are not limited to, fires, explosions, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, transportation interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment, and environmental contamination. A significant limitation on our ability to manufacture products due to disruption of manufacturing\noperations or related infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nHazardous material liability and risk\nOur manufacturing and distribution of chemical products involves the controlled use of hazardous materials. Our operations, therefore, are subject to various associated risks, including chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, fires, mechanical failure, storage facility leaks and similar events. Our suppliers are subject to similar risks that may adversely impact the availability of raw materials. While we adapt our manufacturing and distribution processes to the environmental control standards of regulatory authorities, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous or regulated materials, including injury of our employees, individuals who handle our products or goods treated with our products, or others who claim to have been exposed to our products, nor can we completely eliminate the unanticipated interruption or suspension of operations at our facilities due to such events. We may be held liable for significant damages or fines in the event of contamination or injury, and such assessed damages or fines could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations.\nEnvironmental regulation\nOur industries are subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to a variety of federal and state regulations. Such environmental legislation imposes, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste. Legislation also requires us to operate and maintain our facilities to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. Costs to comply with these regulations are significant to our business. Failure to comply with these laws or failure to obtain permits may expose us to fines, penalties or interruptions in operations that could be material to our results of operations. In addition, some of the finished goods our customers produce, such as expandable polystyrene (EPS), are subject to increasing scrutiny and regulation, which could lead to a reduction in demand for our products.\nSafety, business controls, environmental and cyber risk management\nOur results depend upon management's ability to minimize the inherent risks of our operations, to control effectively our business activities and to minimize the potential for human error. We apply rigorous management systems and continuous focus to workplace safety and to avoid spills or other adverse environmental events. Substantial liabilities and other adverse impacts could result if our systems and controls do not function as intended. Business risks also include the risk of cyber security breaches. If our systems for protecting against cyber security risks prove to be insufficient, we could be adversely affected by having our business systems compromised, our proprietary information altered, lost or stolen, or our business operations disrupted.\nThe use of a new enterprise resource planning system could cause a financial statement error not to be detected\nDuring 2017 we implemented a new enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") system at SHR to replace a previous system. This was a complex process, and the new system resulted in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting, including disclosure controls and procedures. The ongoing improvements being made to the new ERP system could adversely affect the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nBorrowing ability and indebtedness\nIn 2014 we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (\"ARC\"). This agreement contains restrictive clauses which may limit our activities, and operational and financial flexibility. We may not be able to borrow under the ARC if an event of default under the terms of the facility occurs. The ARC contains a number of restrictions that limit our ability, among other things, and subject to certain limited exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness, pledge our assets as security, guarantee obligations of third parties, make investments, undergo a merger or consolidation, dispose of assets or materially change our line of business.\nIn addition, the ARC requires us to meet certain financial ratios, including fixed charge coverage, total leverage ratio, and asset coverage. These non-GAAP measures of liquidity are defined in the ARC. Our ability to meet these financial covenants depends upon the future successful operating performance of the business. If we fail to comply with financial covenants, we would be in default under the ARC and the maturity of our outstanding debt could be accelerated unless\nwe were able to obtain waivers from our lenders. If we were found to be in default under the ARC, it could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nRegulatory and litigation\nEven in countries with well-developed legal systems where we do business, we remain exposed to changes in law that could adversely affect our results, such as increases in taxes, price controls, changes in environmental regulations or other laws that increase our cost of compliance, and government actions to cancel contracts or renegotiate items unilaterally. We may also be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or other legal proceedings, especially in countries such as the United States in which very large and unpredictable punitive damage awards may occur. AMAK's mining and exploration leases are subject to the risk of termination if AMAK does not comply with its contractual obligations. Further, our investment in AMAK is subject to the risk of expropriation or nationalization. If a dispute arises, we may have to submit to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or panel or may have to enforce the judgment of a foreign court or panel in that foreign jurisdiction. Because of our substantial international investment, our business is affected by changes in foreign laws and regulations (or interpretation of existing laws and regulations) affecting our industries, and foreign taxation. We will be directly affected by the adoption of rules and regulations (and the interpretations of such rules and regulations) regarding the exploration and development of mineral properties for economic, environmental and other policy reasons. We may be required to make significant capital expenditures to comply with non-U.S. governmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to our operating costs or may significantly limit our business activities. Additionally, our ability to compete in the international market may be adversely affected by non-U.S. governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of leases, concessions and other contracts or exploration licenses to local contractors or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. We are not currently aware of any specific situations of this nature, but there are always opportunities for this type of difficulty to arise in the international business environment.\nLoss of key personnel and management effectiveness\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial, technical, sales, and marketing positions. We must also keep employees focused on our strategies and goals. The failure to hire, or loss of, key employees could have a significant adverse impact on operations. An important component of our competitive performance is our ability to operate efficiently including our ability to manage expenses and minimize the production of low margin products on an on-going basis. This requires continuous management focus including technological improvements, cost control and productivity enhancements. The extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition.\nRisk associated with extraordinary transactions\nAs part of our business strategy, we sometimes engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures and outsourcing transactions (\"extraordinary transactions\") and enter into agreements relating to such extraordinary transactions in order to further our business objectives. In order to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete extraordinary transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees. Integration and other risks of extraordinary transactions can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions, or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously. If we fail to identify and complete successfully extraordinary transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our revenue, gross margin and profitability. Integration issues are complex, time-consuming and expensive and, without proper planning and implementation, could significantly disrupt our business. The challenges involved in integration include:\n\u2022\nCombining product offerings and entering into new markets in which we are not experienced;\n\u2022\nConvincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus, preventing customers and distributors from deferring purchasing decisions or switching to other suppliers (which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty), and coordinating sales, marketing and distribution efforts;\n\u2022\nMinimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022\nPersuading employees that business cultures are compatible, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, engaging with employee works councils representing an acquired company's non-U.S. employees, integrating employees into the Company, correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs;\n\u2022\nCoordinating and combining administrative, manufacturing, and other operations, subsidiaries, facilities and relationships with third parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures;\n\u2022\nAchieving savings from supply chain integration; and\n\u2022\nManaging integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions.\nWe periodically evaluate and enter into significant extraordinary transactions on an ongoing basis. We may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any extraordinary transaction, and the timeframe for achieving benefits of an extraordinary transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees, suppliers or other third parties. In addition, the pricing and other terms of our contracts for extraordinary transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts, and, during the course of our due diligence, we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate our costs accurately. Any increased or unexpected costs, unanticipated delays or failure to achieve contractual obligations could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable. Managing extraordinary transactions requires varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. These extraordinary transactions also have resulted and in the future may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings. Moreover, we have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with extraordinary transactions, and, to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives acquired in connection with an extraordinary transaction becomes impaired, we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. In order to complete an acquisition, we may issue common stock, potentially creating dilution for existing stockholders, or borrow, affecting our financial condition and potentially our credit ratings. Any prior or future downgrades in our credit rating associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow and result in more restrictive borrowing terms. In addition, our effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain, and extraordinary transactions could impact our effective tax rate. We also may experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing an extraordinary transaction and the risk that an announced extraordinary transaction may not close. As a result, any completed, pending or future transactions may contribute to financial results that differ from the investment community's expectations in a given quarter.\nGuaranteeing performance by others\nFrom time to time, we may be required or determine it is advisable to guarantee performance of loan agreements by others in which we maintain a financial interest. In such instances, if the primary obligor is unable to perform its obligations, we might be forced to perform the primary obligor's obligations which could negatively impact our financial interests.\nInternational market challenges\nAlthough we do not have production operations and assets outside of the US, we do have a global portfolio of customers and thus we are subject to a variety of international market risks including, but not limited to, credit risk and financial conditions of local customers and distributors; potential difficulties in protecting intellectual property; new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions and civil unrest in response to local political conditions.\nAdditional tax liabilities\nWe are subject to income taxes and state taxes in the United States. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different to that which is reflected in our consolidated financial\nstatements. Should any tax authority take issue with our estimates, our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nPublic Law No. 115-97 known as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") was enacted on December 22, 2017, and introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Accounting Standards Codification 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires companies to recognize the effects of tax law changes in the period of enactment. Effective in 2018, the TCJA made a number changes, such as reducing the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35.0% to 21.0%, creating new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings and certain related-party payments, which are referred to as the global intangible low taxed income tax and the base erosion tax, respectively, establishing a dividends received deduction for dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries to the U.S., the elimination or limitation of certain deductions, and imposing a mandatory tax on previously unrepatriated earnings accumulated offshore. Due to the timing of the new tax law provided in the TCJA and the substantial changes it brings, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provides registrants with a measurement period to report the impact of the new US tax law. As a result, the recorded and estimated impacts of the TCJA may change in future periods, which may adversely affect our estimates, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nRisk associated with activist shareholders\nWhile we seek to actively engage with our shareholders and consider their views on business and strategy, we could be subject to actions or proposals from our shareholders that do not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other shareholders. Responding to these shareholders could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our business and operations, and divert the attention of our senior management. Furthermore, uncertainties associated with such activities could negatively impact our ability to execute our strategic plan, retain customer and skilled personnel and affect long-term growth. In addition, such activities may cause our stock price to fluctuate based on temporary or speculative market perceptions that do not necessarily reflect our business operations.\nEconomic and political instability; terrorist acts; war and other political unrest\nThe conflict and hostilities in Yemen could disrupt or interfere with the operations of AMAK whose corporate offices and mining assets are located in Najran province of Saudi Arabia. In addition, the potential for additional future terrorist acts and other recent events, including ISIS terrorist related activities and civil unrest in the Middle East, have caused uncertainty in the world's financial markets and have significantly increased global political, economic and social instability, including in Saudi Arabia, a country in which we have a substantial investment. It is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the United States domestically or abroad, and such acts of terrorism could be directed against our investment in those locations. Such economic and political uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, they could result in a decrease in demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers, create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions. We are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts, conflicts and wars. Our future revenue, gross margin, expenses and financial condition also could suffer due to a variety of international factors, including:\n\u2022 Ongoing instability or changes in a country's or region's economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;\n\u2022 Longer accounts receivable cycles and financial instability among customers;\n\u2022 Trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production, pricing and marketing of products;\n\u2022 Local labor conditions and regulations;\n\u2022 Geographically dispersed workforce;\n\u2022 Changes in the regulatory or legal environment;\n\u2022 Differing technology standards or customer requirements;\n\u2022 Import, export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments, which could affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for labor and raw materials or lead to penalties or restrictions;\n\u2022 Difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner and changes in tax laws; and\n\u2022 Fluctuations in freight costs and disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments.\nBusiness disruption\nBusiness disruptions could harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for some of which we may be self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could harm our revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nExcess products\nAn important component of our competitive performance is our ability to minimize the production of low margin products on an on-going basis. Although the hydrocarbon constituents comprising the petrochemical feedstock we use may vary somewhat over time, they tend to fall into relatively narrow percentage bands as compared to overall feedstock composition. By nature of the fractionation process that we utilize, if we make one product, we make them all; therefore, when we receive a significant order for a particular finished product, additional products may be manufactured necessitating sales into secondary, lower margin markets. We continue to investigate options to maintain or improve margins. We are in the process of constructing an advanced reformer unit with a capacity of 4,000 barrels per day which will allow us to upgrade the value of our byproducts in order to maximize margins. The unit is expected to start up during the third quarter of 2018.\nAn impairment of goodwill could negatively impact our financial results\nAt least annually, we assess goodwill for impairment. If an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, additional quantitative testing is performed. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to quantitative testing. If the quantitative testing indicates that goodwill is impaired, the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value with a charge against earnings. Since we utilize a discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of our operating units, continued weak demand for a specific product line or business could result in an impairment charge. Accordingly, any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill could negatively impact our results of operations.\nDependence on AMAK management\nWe rely upon AMAK's management and Board to employ various respected engineering and financial advisors to assist in the development and evaluation of the mining projects in Saudi Arabia. Notwithstanding the utilization of any outside consultants, our risk will continue to and will ultimately depend upon AMAK's ability to use consultants and experienced personnel to manage the operation in Saudi Arabia.\nInability to control AMAK activities\nAlthough we believe that we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of AMAK, we do not control AMAK's activities. The extent to which we are able to influence specific operating and financial decisions depends on our ability to persuade other AMAK board members and management regarding these policies. Our ability to persuade them may be adversely affected by cultural differences, differing accounting and management practices, differing governmental laws and regulations, and the fact that the AMAK mining project is halfway around the world from our main base of operations in the United States.\nFurther, as described above under \"Item 1: Business\", the Company was required to execute and deliver a limited corporate guarantee to SIDF in connection with AMAK's Loan from SIDF to fund mining operations. If AMAK\nwere to default on its payment obligations under the Loan, the Company may be required to make payments to SIDF under the limited corporate guarantee.\nInability to recoup investment in AMAK\nWe will only recover our investment in AMAK through the receipt of dividends from AMAK or the sale of part or all of our interest in AMAK. There is a risk that we will be unable to recover our investment in AMAK if AMAK is not profitable, or if AMAK's Board of Directors chooses not to declare dividends even if AMAK is profitable. With respect to the sale of part or all of our interest in AMAK, under Saudi Arabian law, AMAK must sell a portion of its equity to the public once AMAK has been profitable for two years. While the proceeds of such a sale might allow us to recover our investment in AMAK, there is no assurance that AMAK will achieve the profitability required for such a public sale, or that the market conditions for any such public sale will be favorable enough to allow us to recover our investment.\nAMAK's inability to provide timely financial information\nIn the event that AMAK is unable to provide timely, accurate financial information to us, our ability to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission within required deadlines could be affected and our standing on the New York Stock Exchange and in the investment community could suffer.\nCancellation of the current mining leases held by AMAK\nIn the event that the Saudi Ministry of Petroleum and Minerals cancels the current leases, AMAK shareholders including us could lose their investment or be forced to sell for a loss.\nAMAK could suffer sustained operational difficulties\nOperating difficulties are many and various, ranging from unexpected geological variations that could result in significant ground or containment failure to breakdown of key capital equipment. Reliable roads, rail networks, ports, power generation and transmission, and water supplies are required to access and conduct AMAK's operations. AMAK transports all of its products first by truck and then by sea. Limitations or interruptions in transport infrastructure could impede its ability to deliver products. Although going forward, operations will be owner-managed, availability of sufficiently skilled operators, engineers, geologists and maintenance technicians in Saudi Arabia can from time to time be severely limited.\nAMAK may have fewer mineral reserves than its estimates indicate\nAMAK's reserves estimations may change substantially if new information subsequently becomes available. Fluctuations in the price of commodities, variation in production costs or different recovery rates may ultimately result in AMAK's estimated reserves being revised. If such a revision were to indicate a substantial reduction in proven or probable reserves at one or more of AMAK's projects, it could negatively affect our investment in AMAK.\nCost pressures could negatively impact AMAK's operating margins and expansion plans\nCost pressures may continue to occur across the resources industry. As the prices for AMAK's products are determined by the global commodity markets in which it operates, AMAK does not generally have the ability to offset these cost pressures through corresponding price increases, which can adversely affect its operating margins or require changes in operations, including, but not limited to, temporary planned shutdowns. Notwithstanding AMAK's efforts to reduce costs and a number of key cost inputs being commodity price-linked, the inability to reduce costs and a timing lag may adversely impact AMAK's operating margins for an extended period.", "PERMNO": 14761, "SIC": 2911, "TIC": "TREC"}
