RISK FACTORS\nThe Corporation is exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the banking business. The more significant of these are addressed by the Corporation\u2019s written policies and procedures. While management is responsible for identifying, assessing and managing risk, the Board of Directors is responsible for risk oversight. The Board fulfills its risk oversight responsibilities largely through its committees. The risks faced by the Corporation include, among others, credit risk, allowance for loan loss risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, market risk for its common stock, economic conditions risk, operational risk, technology risk, key personnel risk, regulatory and legislative risk, income tax risk, external events risk and competitive risk. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Corporation, or that the Corporation currently deems to be immaterial, could also have a material impact on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nCredit Risk\nFor investment securities, loans and bank-owned life insurance, there is always the risk that the Bank will be unable to realize their full carrying value. Credit risk in the Bank\u2019s securities and bank-owned life insurance portfolios has been addressed by adopting a board committee approved investment policy that, among other things, limits terms, types and amounts of holdings, and specifies minimum required credit ratings. Allowable investments include direct obligations of the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated obligations of states and political subdivisions, highly rated corporate obligations and bank-owned life insurance policies issued by highly rated insurance carriers. At the time of purchase, bonds of states and political subdivisions must generally be rated AA or better, notes of states and political subdivisions must generally be rated MIG-1 (or equivalent), commercial paper must be rated A-1 or P-1, and corporate bonds must be rated AA or better. Bank-owned life insurance may only be purchased from insurance carriers rated A or better. For carriers rated AA or better, cash surrender value is limited to 15% of Tier 1 Capital, and for those carriers rated below AA, the limitation is 10% of Tier 1 Capital. Management periodically reviews the creditworthiness of all securities in the Bank\u2019s portfolio other than those issued by the U.S. government or its agencies, and all bank-owned life insurance carriers. Any significant deterioration in the creditworthiness of an issuer or carrier will be analyzed and action taken if deemed appropriate.\nCredit risk in the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio has been addressed by adopting a board committee approved loan policy and by maintaining independent loan and appraisal review functions and an independent credit department. The loan policy contains what the Corporation believes to be prudent underwriting guidelines, which include, among other things, specific loan approval requirements, maximum loan terms, loan to appraised value and debt service coverage limits for mortgage loans, credit score minimums and environmental study requirements.\nThe credit risk within the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio primarily stems from factors such as borrower size, geographic concentration, industry concentration, real estate values, local and national economic conditions and environmental contamination. The Bank\u2019s commercial loans, including those secured by mortgages, are primarily made to small and medium-sized businesses. Such loans sometimes involve a higher degree of risk than those to larger companies because such businesses may have shorter operating histories, higher debt-to-equity ratios and may lack sophistication in internal record keeping and financial and operational controls. In addition, most of the Bank\u2019s loans are made to businesses and consumers on Long Island and in the boroughs of New York City, and a large percentage of these loans are mortgage loans secured by properties located in those areas. At December 31, 2015, multifamily loans amounted to approximately $572 million and comprised approximately 55% of the Bank\u2019s total commercial mortgage portfolio and approximately 27% of the Bank\u2019s total loans secured by real estate. The primary source of repayment for multifamily loans is cash flows from the underlying properties, a substantial portion of which are rent stabilized or rent controlled. Such cash flows are dependent on the strength of the local economy.\nAlthough the economy has improved somewhat, national and local economic conditions continue to be suboptimal. These conditions have caused some of the Bank\u2019s borrowers to be unable to make the required contractual payments on their loans and could cause the Bank to be unable to realize the full carrying value of such loans through its collection efforts. Environmental impairment of properties securing mortgage loans is also a risk. However, at the present time, the Bank is not aware of any existing loans in the portfolio where there is environmental pollution originating on or near the mortgaged properties that would materially affect the value of the portfolio.\nAllowance for Loan Loss Risk\nThe Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses in an amount believed to be adequate to absorb probable incurred losses in its loan portfolio. The maintenance of the allowance for loan losses is governed by a board committee approved allowance for loan and lease losses policy. In arriving at the allowance for loan losses, an impairment analysis is performed on each loan where it is probable that the borrower will not be able to make all required principal and interest payments according to contractual terms. In addition, incurred losses for all other loans in the Bank\u2019s portfolio are determined on a pooled basis taking into account, among other things, historical loss experience, delinquencies, economic conditions, trends in nature and volume of loans, concentrations of credit, changes in lending policies and procedures, experience, ability and depth of lending staff, changes in quality of the loan review function, environmental risks and loan risk ratings. Because estimating the allowance for loan losses is highly subjective in nature and involves a variety of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain, there is the risk that management\u2019s estimate may not accurately capture probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The Bank\u2019s allowance may need to be increased based on, among other things, additional information that comes to light after the estimate is made, changes in circumstances, a recommendation by bank regulators based on their review of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio or the issuance of new accounting standards, such as the finalization and implementation of the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2012-260 - \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses.\u201d The impact of one or more of these factors on the Bank\u2019s allowance could result in the need for a significant increase in the Bank\u2019s provision for loan losses and have a material adverse impact on the Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Bank\u2019s results of operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations generally and having assets and liabilities that have different maturity, repricing and prepayment/withdrawal characteristics. The Bank defines interest rate risk as the risk that the Bank's net interest income and/or economic value of equity (\u201cEVE\u201d) will change when interest rates change. The Bank has addressed interest rate risk by adopting a board committee approved interest rate risk policy which sets forth quantitative risk limits and calls for monitoring and controlling interest rate risk through a variety of techniques including the use of interest rate sensitivity models and traditional repricing gap analysis. Management utilizes a consultant with expertise in bank asset liability management to aid them in these efforts.\nA sustained period of low interest rates could adversely affect the Bank\u2019s earnings. When interest rates are low, as they currently are, borrowers tend to refinance higher rate loans at lower rates and prepayments on mortgages and mortgage securities are elevated. Under those circumstances, the Bank may not be able to reinvest the resulting cash flows in new interest-earning assets with rates as favorable as those on the prepaid loans or investment securities. In addition, subject to the floors contained in many of the Bank\u2019s loan agreements, the Bank\u2019s loans at variable interest rates adjust to lower rates at their reset dates. The positive impact of lower interest rates on the Bank\u2019s cost of funds is currently constrained because many of the Bank\u2019s deposit products are at historically low rates with little if any room for further reductions, and because the Bank funds a significant portion of its average interest-earning assets with noninterest bearing checking deposits and capital.\nIncreases in the federal funds target rate could exert upward pressure on non-maturity deposit liability rates. In a period of rising interest rates, the Bank\u2019s loans and investment securities could reprice slower than its interest-bearing liabilities, which could initially have a negative effect on net interest income. Over a longer period of time, the effect on the Bank\u2019s earnings should be positive primarily because with the passage of time more loans and investment securities will reprice at the higher rates and there will be no offsetting increase in interest expense for those interest-earning assets funded by noninterest-bearing checking deposits and capital.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Bank will not have sufficient funds to accommodate loan growth, meet deposit outflows or make contractual payments on borrowing arrangements. The Bank has addressed liquidity risk by adopting a board committee approved Liquidity Policy and Liquidity Contingency Plan that set forth quantitative risk limits and a protocol for responding to liquidity stress conditions should they arise. The Bank encounters significant competition in its market area from branches of larger banks, various community banks, credit unions and other financial services organizations. This, in addition to renewed consumer confidence in the equity markets, could cause deposit outflows, and such outflows could be significant.\nThe Bank has both internal and external sources of liquidity that can be used to fund loan growth and accommodate deposit outflows. The Bank\u2019s primary internal sources of liquidity are overnight investments, investment securities designated as available-for-sale, maturities and monthly payments on its investment securities and loan portfolios and operations.\nThe Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (\u201cFRB\u201d) and the FHLB of New York, has repurchase agreements in place with a number of brokerage firms and commercial banks and has a federal funds line with a commercial bank. In addition to customer deposits, the Bank\u2019s primary external sources of liquidity are secured borrowings from the FRB, FHLB of New York and repurchase agreement counterparties. In addition, the Bank can purchase overnight federal funds under its existing line. However, the Bank\u2019s FRB membership, FHLB of New York membership, repurchase agreements and federal funds lines do not represent legal commitments to extend credit to the Bank. The amount that the Bank can potentially borrow is currently dependent on, among other things, the amount of unencumbered eligible securities and loans that the Bank can use as collateral and the collateral margins required by the lenders.\nMarket Risk for the Corporation\u2019s Common Stock\nThe Corporation\u2019s common stock is included in the Russell 3000 and Russell 2000 Indexes, which are reconstituted annually. Upon reconstitution in May 2015, the average market capitalization of companies in the Russell 2000 Index was $1.9 billion, the median market capitalization was $805 million, the capitalization of the largest company in the index was $4.3 billion and the capitalization of the smallest company in the index was $177 million. The Corporation\u2019s market capitalization on December 31, 2015 was approximately $424 million. The Corporation believes that inclusion in the Russell indexes has positively impacted the price, trading volume and liquidity of its common stock. Conversely, if the Corporation\u2019s market capitalization falls below the minimum necessary to be included in the indexes at any future reconstitution date, the opposite could occur.\nEconomic Conditions Risk\nAlthough the economy has improved somewhat, national and local economic conditions continue to show signs of weakness. This poses risks to both the Corporation\u2019s business and the banking industry as a whole. Specific risks include reduced loan demand from quality borrowers; increased competition for loans; increased loan loss provisions resulting from deterioration in loan quality; reduced net interest income and net interest margin caused by a sustained period of low interest rates; interest rate volatility; price competition for deposits due to liquidity concerns or otherwise; volatile equity markets; and higher cost to attract capital to support growth.\nIn addition to the significant risks posed by unfavorable economic conditions, the Corporation could experience deposit outflows as national and local economic conditions improve and investors pursue alternative investment opportunities.\nOperational Risk\nThe Corporation relies on its system of internal controls and the internal controls of its third-party service providers (\u201cTPSPs\u201d) to ensure that transactions are captured, recorded, processed and reported properly; confidential customer information is safeguarded; and fraud by employees and persons outside the Corporation is detected and prevented. The Corporation\u2019s internal controls and/or those of its TPSPs may prove to be ineffective or employees of the Corporation and/or its TPSPs may fail to comply with or override the controls, either of which could result in significant financial loss to the Corporation, adverse action by bank regulatory authorities or the SEC and damage to the Corporation\u2019s reputation.\nTechnology Risk\nThe delivery of financial products and services has increasingly become technology-driven. The Bank\u2019s ability to competitively meet the needs of its customers in a cost-efficient manner is dependent on its ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Bank outsources most of its data processing to TPSPs. If TPSPs encounter difficulties, or if the Bank has difficulty communicating with them, the Bank\u2019s ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions could be affected, and the Bank\u2019s business operations could be adversely impacted. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through TPSPs. The Bank\u2019s website and online banking products have been the target of cyber attacks in the past. While the Bank and its TPSPs believe they have successfully blocked attempts to infiltrate the Bank\u2019s systems, there is always the possibility that successful attacks have not yet been identified.\nThe Bank has established board committee approved policies to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures, interruptions and security breaches and relies on commonly used security and processing systems to provide the security and authentication necessary for the processing of data. The Bank makes use of logon and user access controls, multifactor and out of band authentication, transaction limits, firewalls, antivirus software, intrusion protection monitoring, vulnerability scans and independent penetration testing. System failures or interruptions are addressed in the Bank\u2019s emergency and disaster recovery policy and its incident response and business continuity plans. In addition, for TPSPs of data processing and other significant services, the Bank obtains and reviews audit reports prepared by independent registered public accounting firms regarding their financial condition and the effectiveness of their internal controls.\nThese precautions may not protect our systems from all compromises or breaches of security and there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. The Bank carries a cyber liability insurance policy to mitigate the amount of any financial loss. However, the occurrence of any systems failure, interruption or breach of security could damage the Bank\u2019s reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject the Bank to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose the Bank to civil litigation and possible financial liability beyond any insurance coverage. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nKey Personnel Risk\nThe Corporation\u2019s future success depends in part on the continued service of its executive officers and other key members of management and its staff, as well as its ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain additional highly qualified employees. The loss of services of key personnel could have an adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition because their skills, knowledge of the Bank\u2019s market and years of industry experience may be difficult to replace.\nRegulatory and Legislative Risk\nThe Corporation and the Bank are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by, among others, the Federal Reserve Board, OCC and FDIC, which also insures the Bank\u2019s deposits. Regulation and supervision govern the activities in which a bank and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of depositors. Regulatory requirements affect virtually all aspects of the Corporation\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s business, including investment practices, lending practices, deposit offerings and capital levels. The regulators have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including imposing restrictions on bank operations and expansion plans, imposing deposit insurance premiums and other assessments, setting required levels for the allowance for loan losses and capital, and imposing restrictions on the ability to pay cash dividends and other capital distributions to stockholders. Changes in laws, regulations and supervisory guidance, or the Corporation\u2019s and the Bank\u2019s compliance with these laws and regulations as judged by the regulators, could have a significant negative impact on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The Corporation manages the risk of noncompliance with laws and regulations by having board committee approved compliance policies, hiring and retaining employees with the experience and skills necessary to address compliance on an ongoing basis, and consulting, when necessary with legal counsel and other outside experts on compliance matters.\nIncome Tax Risk\nThe Corporation is subject to income tax under Federal, New York State and New York City laws and regulations. Changes in such laws and regulations, including laws and regulations associated with having a captive REIT, could increase the Corporation\u2019s tax burden and such increase could have a material negative impact on its results of operations.\nExternal Events Risk - Weather and Terrorism\nWeather-related events have adversely impacted our market area, especially areas located near coastal waters and flood prone areas. Significant flooding and other storm-related damage may become more common in the future. Financial institutions have been, and continue to be, targets of terrorist threats aimed at compromising operating and communication systems, and the metropolitan New York area remains a central target for potential acts of terrorism. Weather-related and terrorist events could cause significant damage, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional operating expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing repayment of our loans and result in the loss of revenue. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCompetitive Risk\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with numerous commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokers, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business. In addition, large competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do. Competitive forces may limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area.
