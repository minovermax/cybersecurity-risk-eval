we fail to maintain and grow our relationships with media companies and advertisers, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn our digital commercial partnerships business, we act as an intermediary between primarily global media companies and advertisers in 30 countries. Our continued success depends, among other things, on our ability to maintain existing relationships with these entities and develop new relationships with such entities.\nWe must maintain existing relationships with media companies and the digital platforms they own and operate, as well as develop new relationships with such media companies. We currently have commercial agreements, many of which are exclusive, with Meta, Spotify, TikTok, Twitter and certain other digital platforms. Some of these agreements provide that we are the only authorized intermediary for advertisers to acquire digital advertising inventory for that platform in a specific geographic market. The agreements we have entered into with these media companies provide, among other things, that we act as their representative and sell their digital advertising inventory, and achieve certain minimum target sales during specified periods of time. These commercial agreements typically have a one- to three-year term and are subject to renewal upon expiration. The commercial terms under these agreements, including but not limited to the amount of revenue we earn, are subject to renegotiation when they are renewed. Additionally, many of these agreements may be terminated upon notice or upon our failure to sell a minimum amount of digital advertising inventory, at our partners\u2019 discretion. Any such changes of terminations could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations, alter or result in the termination of our relationship with such media company and/or result in our withdrawal from a given geographic market.\nOur advertising customers consist of businesses and sometimes the ad agencies that place advertisements for these businesses. The agreements we typically enter into with our advertising customers or their ad agencies typically provides for a range of services, including securing advertising insertions on a digital platform, and may provide for certain managed services. Since these agreements typically do not require our advertising customers or their ad agencies to use our services exclusively, they may use other digital advertising companies - our competitors - or place ads directly with those media companies that provide such option in target markets. We must also provide our services in a way that satisfies our advertising customers or their ad agencies. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our existing relationships with our advertising customers or their ad agencies, or develop new relationships with advertising customers or their ad agencies. They may also allocate advertising budgets towards digital\nplatforms with which we do not have commercial agreements. If we fail to retain or expand our existing advertiser base or increase the amount of advertising purchases they make through us, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to respond to changes in the digital advertising industry, our business may become less competitive.\nOur business depends not only on our ability to effectively service the existing media companies and advertisers with which we have relationships, but to develop new solutions services in order to meet the changing needs of media companies and advertisers. Digital platforms are quickly evolving, while both media companies and advertisers are learning more about the digital advertising industry. As advertisers further develop their own technological knowledge that would allow them to navigate the digital advertising market themselves, and to the degree that digital platforms become more directly accessible to advertisers, our role as an intermediary between media companies and advertisers could become less attractive.\nWe compete with media companies themselves, as well as with other digital advertising companies.\nWe compete both with other digital advertising companies and with large media companies themselves that sell their own advertising inventory directly to advertisers. The decision of such media companies to compete with us may be unrelated to the results we achieve under the commercial agreements we have with such companies.\nFurthermore, if we fail to respond to changes in the rapidly evolving digital advertising industry, our business model may become less attractive to media companies. Although historically global media companies have been slow to open offices in small, emerging economies, they may elect to do so in the future, which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe digital advertising market is relatively new and depends on acceptance in the emerging economies in which we our digital operations are primarily focused.\nThe digital advertising market is relatively new and may not sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. While display advertising, such as print advertising, has been used successfully for decades, digital advertising on mobile, social media and other devices and platforms, is less well established. We depend, in part, on a broad level of acceptance and expansion of digital advertising, especially in the emerging economies which are the focus of our digital operations. If demand for digital advertising does not continue to grow or if digital advertising solutions do not achieve widespread acceptance, our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe must access digital advertising inventory on a regular basis to grow our business.\nOur revenue derives from placing digital advertisements on third-party digital platforms. We do not own or operate the platforms, or the advertising inventory, upon which these advertisements are placed. The commercial agreements we enter into with media companies for which we act as commercial partner do not include long-term obligations requiring them to make their inventory available to us for sale to our advertising customers or their ad agencies. Moreover, many of these agreements may be terminated upon notice or upon our failure to sell a minimum amount of digital advertising inventory, at our partners\u2019 discretion. Even though digital advertising inventory has tended to exceed the demand for digital advertising, leading to excess inventory available to advertisers, we cannot guarantee that, if demand for digital advertising continues to grow, we will continue to have ready access to adequate levels of digital advertising inventory to satisfy customer demand.\nTo date, we have relied, and currently expect to continue to rely, on commercial partnerships with a small number of large media companies for the majority of our digital segment revenue.\nWe derive the majority of our digital segment revenues from a small number of media companies for which we act as commercial partner. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, revenue from the top five media companies for which we act as commercial partner accounted for 61% and 26% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, Meta alone accounted for 55% and 24% of our consolidated revenue, respectively.\nWe expect that we will continue to depend upon a relatively small number of media companies for a majority of our digital segment revenue for at least the foreseeable future. The loss of any relationship with one of our existing media company customers, for any reason, could result in a loss of substantial revenue in the foreseeable future, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCompetition in the geographic markets in which we currently operate and in the future may operate may increase, and existing or new competitors could enter these markets.\nCompetition in the geographic markets in which we operate, in some of which where we have exclusive commercial agreements as commercial partner, may increase in the future. Our primary competitors are other advertising representation companies and, to an increasing degree, media companies themselves. Certain competitors may seek to gain market share by providing enhanced managed\nservices or offering discount pricing, in response to which we may be required to lower our own fees or may lose business to new competitors. Such developments could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn certain cases, we have guaranteed payment of fees to the media companies for which we act as commercial partner, creating a significant financial risk for us.\nSome of the commercial agreements we have entered into with media companies for which we act as commercial partner obligate us to guarantee fees to be paid to these media companies. This puts significant financial risk on us if we are unable to collect fees in full from our advertising customers or their ad agencies.\nFor example, we allocate each of our advertisers a budget that they can use to purchase digital advertising inventory. We base this budget on financial and credit information, including information provided by our advertisers. If an advertiser were to send us inaccurate information, or if we were to fail to analyze the credit worthiness of any customer accurately, we may grant an advertiser more favorable credit or payment terms than are warranted, resulting in its difficulty in fulfilling its financial obligations to us.\nOur systems and IT infrastructure may be subject to security breaches and other cybersecurity incidents.\nWe rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our IT systems, some of which are managed or hosted by third parties, and our business operations may involve the transmission and/or storage of data, including in certain instances counterparties\u2019 and employees\u2019 business and personally identifiable information. Maintaining the security of computers, computer networks and data storage resources is a critical issue for us and our counterparties, as security breaches, including computer viruses and malware, denial of service actions, misappropriation of data and similar events through the Internet (including via devices and apps connected to the Internet), and through email attachments and persons with access to these information systems, could result in vulnerabilities and loss of and/or unauthorized access to confidential information. We may face attempts by hackers, cybercriminals or others with authorized access to our systems to misappropriate our proprietary information and technology, interrupt our business and/or gain unauthorized access to confidential information. The reliability and security of our IT infrastructure and software, and our ability to expand and update technologies in response to our changing needs and the changing needs of our customers, is critical to our business. To the extent that any disruptions or security breaches result in a loss or damage to our data, it could cause harm to our reputation, potentially impair our advertisers\u2019 access to Smadex and could potentially cause operational delays and other detrimental impacts on our operations. In addition, we could face enforcement actions by governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate, which could result in fines, penalties and/or other liabilities, which may cause us to incur legal fees and costs and/or additional costs associated with responding to a cyberattack.\nIncreased regulation regarding cybersecurity may increase our costs of compliance, including fines and penalties, as well as costs of cybersecurity audits and associated repairs or updates to infrastructure, physical systems or data processing systems. Any of these actions could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Although we maintain insurance coverage to protect us against some of these risks, such coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the event we experience a cybersecurity incident, data breach or disruption, unauthorized access or failure of systems.\nWe are subject to new and rapidly evolving regulations in respect of protection of personal data and any failure by us to comply with these regulations could result in loss of business and/or fines.\nThe handling and protection of PII is regulated in many jurisdictions where we operate, including but not limited to the CCPA in California, the LGPD in Brazil and the GDPR in the EU. These privacy and data-protection related laws and regulations are evolving rapidly, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations. In particular, the GDPR, which became effective in 2018, poses increased compliance challenges both for companies operating within the E.U. and non-E.U. companies that administer or process certain personal data of E.U. residents. The implementation of the GDPR prompted various other countries to implement or update their own data protection laws and regulations.\nAny failure to comply with applicable data protection laws and regulations in any of the jurisdiction where we do business could subject us to significant penalties, negative publicity and reputational damage with our advertising customers or the media companies for which we act as commercial partner, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international operations subject us to significant costs and risks, which risks may increase if and as our overseas operations continue to expand.\nOur international digital operations subject us to many risks associated with supporting a rapidly growing business across many cultures, customs, monetary, legal and regulatory systems, primarily in emerging economies. We currently have employees in 28 countries on five continents, and the countries in which our personnel are located and in which we operate includes primarily emerging economies. Such general risks include but are not limited to geopolitical concerns, local politics, governmental instability, socioeconomic disparities, fiscal policies, high inflation and hyper-inflation, currency fluctuations, currency exchange controls, restrictions on repatriating foreign-derived profits to the United States, local regulatory compliance, punitive tariffs, unstable local tax policies, trade embargoes, import and export license requirements, trade restrictions, greater difficulty collecting accounts receivable, unfamiliarity with local laws and regulations, differing legal standards in enforcing or defending our rights in courts or otherwise, the possibility of less favorable intellectual property protection than is provided in the United States, changes in labor conditions, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, difficulties in finding personnel locally who are capable of complying with the financial and reporting requirements of U.S. reporting companies, actions taken by foreign governments to respond to localized public health emergencies, such as recent quarantines and travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other cultural differences. Foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the U.S. economy in growth of gross domestic product, rate of inflation, market development, rate of savings, capital investment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payments positions, and in many other respects.\nSome of the key specific risks to which we are subject as a result of our international operations in those markets where we currently operate, and those markets where we may expand our operations in the future, include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022significant management, travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with having multiple international operations;\n\u2022potential difficulty in enforcing contracts, pursuing collections and asserting other legal rights due to different legal systems compared to the United States;\n\u2022regulatory and legal compliance, including with anti-bribery laws, import and export control laws, potential economic sanctions and other regulatory limitations or obligations on our operations;\n\u2022significant administrative costs and risks associated with compliance with local laws and regulations, including relating to privacy and data security such as the GDPR in the EU and the LGPD in Brazil;\n\u2022reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022compliance with the laws of numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions, including withholding obligations, and overlapping of different tax regimes.\n\u2022increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities, including risks of maintaining internal controls and procedures, which we have experienced in the past and might experience in the future;\n\u2022concerns regarding unstable or changing politic and/or economic conditions in the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022the impact of global and regional recessions and economic instability;\n\u2022heightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements;\n\u2022reduced protection of free speech and potential restrictions on access to social media and the Internet;\n\u2022difficulties in invoicing and collecting in foreign currencies and associated foreign currency exposure;\n\u2022difficulties in repatriating or transferring funds from or converting currencies;\n\u2022administrative difficulties, costs and expenses related to various local languages and cultural differences; and\n\u2022varied labor and employment laws, including those relating to termination of employees.\nAs a result of the breadth of our rapidly growing international digital operations, we may incur significant operating expenses, especially measured as a percentage of revenue generated in some of the markets in which we operate and may operate in the future. Our failure to manage successfully our growth internationally could adversely affect our result of operations and financial condition.\nExchange controls and other restrictions on the movement of capital out of certain jurisdictions or otherwise may adversely affecting our ability to repatriate funds.\nIn certain jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to the risk that regulatory authorities impose exchange controls or restrictions on the movement of capital, including restrictions on repatriation of funds or repatriation of profits. These controls may take different forms, but may include restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred or dividends that can be paid upstream\nto us from such jurisdictions. For example, in certain jurisdictions, including Argentina, India and South Africa, we must obtain regulatory approval prior to the repatriation of funds from these jurisdictions. We work to obtain applicable approvals in the jurisdictions that impose these controls and restrictions, but we cannot provide any assurance that such approvals will be obtained in a timely manner, or at all. These exchange control measures may also prevent or restrict the ability to hold foreign currency in cash within the relevant jurisdiction. If we are unable to transfer such amounts from such jurisdictions when and as needed, we will remain subject to foreign exchange risk relating to such retained funds denominated in local currencies, to the extent we cannot convert such funds into other currencies (whether as a result of foreign exchange restrictions in such jurisdictions or any restrictions on transferring funds out of such jurisdictions). This may subject us to significant foreign exchange risk, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nIn addition, repatriations of funds from other jurisdictions may be subject to withholding, income and other taxes under the laws of those jurisdictions. If our international locations are unable to repatriate funds and/or make other payments or transfers of funds to us when needed, we may be unable to satisfy certain of our financial obligations, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flow.\nPolitical instability and greater government control of society and local economies are not uncommon in many emerging economies, including some of the markets in which we operate and may operate in the future.\nWe operate in 30 countries. The governments of some of the countries in which we operate, primarily emerging economies, often exercise significant influence or control over such countries\u2019 economies. In addition, due to a certain level of political instability, changes in government, regimes or political philosophy as a result of democratic or non-democratic actions, may result in changes in policy and regulations. These changes could be sudden and fundamental. Some of such actions and resulting changes may include, among other things:\n\u2022blocking access to bank accounts;\n\u2022growth or downturn of the economy of the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022interest rates and monetary policies;\n\u2022exchange rates and currency fluctuations;\n\u2022restrictions on capital and funds expatriation;\n\u2022exchange control policies and restrictions on remittances abroad and repatriation of funds;\n\u2022inflation;\n\u2022currency devaluations;\n\u2022hyperinflation;\n\u2022wage and price controls;\n\u2022liquidity of the domestic capital and lending markets;\n\u2022blocked access to, or freezes on, bank accounts;\n\u2022bank failures without adequate bank deposit insurance protection;\n\u2022modifications to laws and regulations, sometimes radical changes, according to political, social and economic interests;\n\u2022fiscal policy, monetary policy and changes in tax laws or rates;\n\u2022economic, political and social instability, including general strikes, mass demonstrations and civil strikes;\n\u2022high levels of unemployment and underemployment;\n\u2022labor and social security regulations;\n\u2022public health crises, including but not limited to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022limited infrastructure, including access to telecommunications and Internet services;\n\u2022energy and water shortages and rationing;\n\u2022commodity prices;\n\u2022high levels of organized crime activity;\n\u2022government intervention in the private sector, including through potential nationalization or expropriation of private enterprises, and\n\u2022other political, diplomatic, social and economic developments in or affecting the countries in which we operate.\nWe have no control over and cannot predict what measures or policies any governments may take in the future. However, any such changes, or combination of changes, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be exposed to certain risks enforcing our legal rights generally in some of the countries in which we operate.\nUnlike the United States, most of the countries in which we operate have a civil law system based on written statutes in which judicial decisions have limited precedential value. While we believe that most or all the countries in which we operate have enacted laws and regulations to deal with economic matters such as corporate organization and governance, foreign investment, intellectual property, commerce, taxation and trade, our experience in interpreting and enforcing our rights under these laws and regulations is limited, and our future ability to enforce commercial claims or to resolve commercial disputes in any of these countries is therefore unpredictable. These matters may be subject to the exercise of considerable discretion by national, provincial or municipal governments, agencies and/or courts, and forces and factors unrelated to the legal merits of a particular matter or dispute may influence their determination.\nInfrastructure and Internet connectivity in the countries in which we operate may impact our operations.\nThe emerging economies in which we operate, and in which we may operate in the future, may be prone to weakness in infrastructure, including potential energy shortages and/or outages, inadequate or unreliable telecommunications, and lack of adequate Internet connectivity and bandwidth. Any of these factors could adversely affect the success of an advertiser's advertising campaigns or the perceived benefit to it placing, or continuing to place, digital advertisements in those markets.\nIn the past we have experienced, and we may in the future experience, difficulty establishing adequate management and financial controls in some of the countries in which we operate.\nCertain of the countries in which we operate historically have been deficient in U.S.-style local management and concepts of internal control over financial reporting, or ICFR, as well as in modern banking and other control systems. As our digital operations have grown, we have experienced these problems and may experience them in new markets in which we may operate or with companies we have recently acquired or may acquire in the future. We have had, and we may have, difficulty in hiring and retaining a sufficient number of locally-qualified employees to work in such countries who are capable of satisfying all the obligations of a U.S. public reporting company, including ICFR. As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing adequate management and financial controls (including ICFR), collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records and instituting business practices in such countries in order to meet the requirements of U.S. GAAP and the rules and regulations of the SEC as in effect from time to time that are applicable to reporting companies.\nRevenue in our digital segment depends significantly on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technology, as well as client preferences and expectations as a result thereof.\nOur industry is subject to rapid and frequent changes in technology, evolving client needs and interests and the frequent introduction by our competitors of new and enhanced services. We must constantly make investment decisions regarding services and technology to meet client demand and evolving industry standards. If new or existing competitors have more attractive services, we may lose advertising clients or advertising clients may decrease their use of our services. New client demands, superior competitive services or new industry standards could require us to make unanticipated and costly changes to our digital platforms or business model. If we fail to adapt to our rapidly changing industry or to evolving client needs, demand for our services could decrease and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to generate revenue in our digital segment depends, in part, on our ability to collect data from various sources, which may be restricted by a number of factors, including restrictions imposed by third party technology companies.\nOur ability to optimize the delivery of digital advertisements depends on our ability to successfully leverage data, including data that we collect from advertisers, publishers and third parties, as well as our own operating history. Using cookies and non-cookie based mechanisms, we collect information about the interactions of users with advertisers and publishers\u2019 digital properties, including, for example, information about the placement of advertisements and users\u2019 interactions with our clients\u2019 websites or advertisements. Our ability to successfully leverage such data depends, in part, on our continued ability to access and use such data, which could be restricted by a number of factors, including new developments in, or new interpretations of, laws, regulations and industry standards, consumer choice, changes in technology, including changes in web browser technology, increased visibility of consent or \u201cdo not\ntrack\u201d mechanisms or \u201cad-blocking\u201d software, and restrictions imposed by large software companies and platform providers, web browser developers or other software developers. For example, mobile operating system and browser providers have announced product changes as well as future plans to limit the ability of app developers to collect and use data to target and measure advertising. Today, three major web browsers - Apple\u2019s Safari, Mozilla\u2019s Firefox and Microsoft\u2019s Edge - block third-party cookies by default. Google has introduced new controls over third-party cookies in its Chrome web browser and has announced plans to phase out support for third-party cookies in Chrome by 2023. Last year Apple announced that it plans to make certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with the release of its iOS 14 operating system that will reduce the ability to target and measure advertising. These types of restrictions could reduce the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms, and as a result could have an adverse effect on the results of our digital operations.\nThe technology on which we rely may not be protectable, which could result in competition from others who may utilize the same, or similar technology.\nWe rely on various technologies in our business, including but not limited to our Smadex ad purchasing platform, and the aggregation and analysis of data collected about online users in our digital ad solutions operations. While much of this technology is proprietary, we have not determined the extent to which this technology is protectable. To the extent that such technology is not protectable, others could use the same, or similar, technology in competition with us. Such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and results of operations.\nGeneral Operational Risks\nWe operate in highly competitive industries subject to changing technologies, and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries. Our television stations and radio stations compete for audiences and advertising with other television stations, radio stations and digital media platforms, as well as with other forms of media and content delivery. Advances in technologies or alternative methods of content delivery, as well as changes in audience or advertiser expectations driven by changes in these or other technologies and methods of content delivery across our segments, could have a negative effect on our business. Examples of such advances in technologies include video-on-demand, satellite radio, video games, text messaging, streaming video and downloaded content from mobile phones, tablets and other personal video and audio devices. For example, streaming services and devices that allow users to view or listen to television or radio programs on a time-shifted, on-demand basis, and technologies which enable users to fast-forward or skip advertisements altogether, such as DVRs and mobile devices, are causing changes in consumer behavior that could affect the perceived attractiveness of our services to advertisers, and could adversely affect our advertising revenue and our results of operations. In addition, further increases in the use of mobile devices which allow users to view or listen to content of their own choosing, in their own time, while avoiding traditional commercial advertisements, could adversely affect our advertising revenue and our results of operations. Additionally, MVPDs, direct-to-home satellite operators, and other sources have implemented OTT services (operated by MVPDs and others, including Dish Network, AT&T/DirecTV, YouTube and Sony) that allow them to transmit targeted programming or limited bundles of broadcast and non-broadcast programming that may or may not include our stations over the Internet to audiences, potentially leading to increased competition for viewers in our markets. New technologies and methods of buying advertising present an additional competitive challenge, as competitors offer products and services such as the ability to purchase advertising programmatically or bundled offline and online advertising, aimed at capturing advertising spend that previously went to broadcasters.\nOur inability, for technological, business or other reasons, to adapt to changes in program offerings and technology on a timely and effective basis, exploit new sources of revenue from these changes, or to enhance, develop, introduce and deliver compelling advertising solutions in response to changing market conditions and technologies or evolving expectations of advertisers may adversely affect our business prospects and results of operations.\nChanges in the competitive landscape or technology may impact our ability to monetize our spectrum assets.\nWith the proliferation of mobile devices, new and expanding mechanisms for the distribution of video programming, and advances in technology that have freed up spectrum capacity, the monetization of our spectrum usage rights has become an integral part of our business in recent years. We rely on the demand to broadcast multicast networks and demand from telecommunications operators to operate interference free in our markets in order to monetize our spectrum. There are no assurances that this demand will continue in future periods. Additionally, program offerings and how they are made available as well as technology involving the utilization of spectrum are evolving rapidly. If we were not able, for technological, business or other reasons, to adapt to these changes in technology on a timely and effective basis, our ability to monetize our spectrum assets could be affected and have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe do not have long-term commitments from our advertisers, and we may not be able to retain or attract new advertisers or their ad agencies.\nMost of our advertising customers or their ad agencies do business with us by requesting that we place insertion orders for advertising. Typically, these insertion orders may be cancelled by our customers or their ad agencies prior to the completion of the campaign without penalty, subject to payment for advertisements that have already been delivered. Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to secure repeat business from existing advertisers, while expanding the number of advertisers for which we provide services. Because we do not have long-term agreements with advertisers, we cannot guarantee that our current advertisers will continue to use our services, or that we will be able to replace advertisers who cease using our services with new advertising customers. These events, were they to occur, would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations, especially if we are unable to replace such advertising purchases. Many of our expenses are based, at least in part, on our expectations of future revenue and are therefore relatively fixed once budgeted. Therefore, weakness in advertising sales would adversely impact both our revenue and our results of operations.\nWe could be adversely affected by a competing radio station's format in a given market in which we operate.\nIf a competing radio station within a market converts to a format similar to that of one of our stations, or if one of our competitors upgrades its stations, we could suffer a reduction in ratings and advertising revenue in that market.\nOur business is exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key advertisers and other strategic business partners.\nThe current economic crisis resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may result in financial instability or other adverse effects for many of our advertisers and other strategic business partners. Disruption of the credit markets, a prolonged recession and/or sluggish economic growth in future periods could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to access credit which supports the continuation and expansion of their businesses and could result in advertising or broadcast cancellations or suspensions, payment delays or defaults by our customers.\nWe are a party to various retransmission consent agreements that may be terminated or not extended following their current termination dates.\nIf our retransmission consent agreements are terminated or not extended following their current termination dates, our ability to reach MVPD subscribers and, thereby, compete effectively, may be adversely affected, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRetransmission consent revenue may not continue to grow at recent rates and are subject to reverse network compensation.\nWhile we expect the amount of revenues generated from our retransmission consent agreements to continue to grow in the near-term and beyond, the rate of growth of such revenue may not continue at recent or current rates and may be detrimentally affected by a variety of factors. The principal factor is the reduction in subscribers as existing subscribers elect to terminate service, thereby reducing the subscriber base on which retransmission consent payments are determined. Other factors that may have an adverse effect on such revenues are network program suppliers seeking reverse network compensation, the growing concentration in the MVPD industry, and the resistance of MVPDs to continue to compensate broadcasters adequately for the programming that they deliver. All of these factors may result in the amounts that MVPDs are willing or able to pay for our programming being detrimentally affected.\nWe may be unable to integrate any acquisitions that we undertake successfully, which could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial conditions and result in operations.\nSubject to certain restrictions contained in the 2017 Credit Agreement, we plan to continue to evaluate opportunities to make future acquisitions as opportunities present themselves, in a manner that is consistent with our overall acquisition strategy. We cannot accurately predict the timing, size, and success of any currently planned or future acquisitions. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to complete the acquisitions of candidates that we identify. Additionally, unforeseen expenses, delays and competition frequently encountered in connection with pursuing acquisition targets could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our operating results.\nWe also may be unable to effectively complete an integration of the acquired businesses with our own or achieve our desired operating, growth, and performance goals for acquired businesses. The integration of acquired businesses involves numerous risks, including:\n\u2022the potential disruption of our core business;\n\u2022the potential strain on our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures;\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business;\n\u2022costs relating to liabilities which we agree to assume;\n\u2022unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u2022problems assimilating the purchased operations or technologies;\n\u2022risks associated with entering markets and businesses in which we have little or no prior experience;\n\u2022failure of acquired businesses to achieve expected results;\n\u2022adverse effects on existing business relationships;\n\u2022the risk of impairment charges related to potential write-downs of acquired assets; and\n\u2022the potential inability to create uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies, and information systems.\nWe cannot assure you that we would be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions, and our inability to do so could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nTelevisaUnivision\u2019s ownership of our Class U common stock may make some transactions difficult or impossible to complete without TelevisaUnivision\u2019s consent.\nTelevisaUnivision is the holder of all of our issued and outstanding Class U common stock. Although the Class U common stock has limited voting rights and does not include the right to elect directors, we may not, without the consent of TelevisaUnivision, merge, consolidate or enter into a business combination, dissolve or liquidate or dispose of any interest in any FCC license with respect to television stations which are affiliates of TelevisaUnivision, among other things. TelevisaUnivision\u2019s ownership interest may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible to complete without TelevisaUnivision\u2019s support or due to TelevisaUnivision\u2019s then-existing media interests in applicable markets.\nIf our affiliation or other contractual relationships with broadcast networks, including but not limited to TelevisaUnivision, change in an adverse manner, it could negatively affect our television ratings, business, revenue and results of operations.\nOur affiliations and other contractual relationships television networks, particularly TelevisaUnivision, have a significant impact on our business, revenue and results of operations of our television stations. If our affiliation agreements or another contractual relationship with a network, especially in the case of the TelevisaUnivision network, were terminated, in whole or in part, or if a network, such as TelevisaUnivision, were to stop providing programming to us for any reason and we were unable to obtain replacement programming of comparable quality, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and results of operations. We regularly engage in discussions with our network partners regarding various matters relating to our contractual relationships. If our network partners were to not continue to provide programming, marketing, available advertising time and other support to us on the same basis as currently provided, or if our affiliation agreements or another contractual relationships with them were to otherwise change in an adverse manner, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and results of operations.\nOur television stations compete for audiences and advertising revenue primarily on the basis of programming content and advertising rates. Audience ratings are a key factor in determining our television advertising rates and the revenue that we generate. If our network partners\u2019 programming success or ratings were to decline, it could lead to a reduction in our advertising rates and advertising revenue on which our television business depends. Additionally, by aligning ourselves closely with TelevisaUnivision, we might forego other opportunities that could diversify our television programming and avoid dependence on TelevisaUnivision\u2019s television networks.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property rights claims by third parties, which may be extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.\nThird parties may assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights in proprietary technology against us for which we may be liable. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from operating our business. Although third parties may offer a license to their technology, the terms of any offered license may not be satisfactory to us and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be materially and adversely affected. In addition, some licenses may be non-exclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and ultimately may not be successful. Furthermore, a successful claimant could secure a judgment or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or that requires us to pay substantial damages, including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed such claimant's patents or copyrights, royalties or other fees. Any of these events could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity threats which could lead to business disruptions or data breaches that could damage our reputation, harm our business, expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may be subject to disruptions, breaches or cyber-attacks of our secured networks and information technology systems caused by illegal hacking, criminal fraud or impersonation, computer viruses, ransomware, acts of vandalism or terrorism or employee error, and our security measures or those of any third party service providers we use may not detect or prevent such security breaches. Malicious state actors have increased their cyberattacks not only on private and public entities but increasingly are using supply chain attacks to broadly infiltrate numerous users of compromised systems. We may incur significant costs to investigate, eliminate, remediate or alleviate cybersecurity breaches and vulnerabilities and to improve our information security capabilities, which could be significant, and our efforts to protect against such breaches or vulnerabilities may not be successful. Any such compromise of our information security or the third-party providers on which we rely could also result in the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information or the unauthorized release of customer or employee data or a violation of privacy or other laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such incidents could subject us to substantial governmental fines and civil liability in ensuing litigation. Any of the foregoing could irreparably damage our reputation and business and/or expose us to material monetary liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on key personnel.\nOur business is managed by a small number of key management and operating personnel, and the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that our future success will also depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel and to effectively train and manage our employee base.\nFinancial Risks\nOur substantial level of debt could limit our ability to grow and compete.\nOur total indebtedness was approximately $214.2 million as of December 31, 2021. A significant portion of our cash flow from operations is and will continue to be used to service our debt obligations, and our ability to obtain additional financing is limited by the terms of the 2017 Credit Agreement. We may not have sufficient future cash flow to meet our debt payments, or we may not be able to refinance any of our debt at maturity. We have pledged all of our domestic assets and our existing and future domestic subsidiaries to our lenders as collateral. Our lenders could proceed against the collateral to repay outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations. If amounts outstanding under the 2017 Credit Agreement were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full the obligation owed to such lender.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including without limitation:\n\u2022preventing us, under the terms of the 2017 Credit Agreement, from obtaining additional financing to grow our business and compete effectively;\n\u2022limiting our ability, as a practical matter, to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our growth strategy or other purposes; and\n\u2022placing us at a disadvantage compared to those of our competitors who have less debt.\nHistorically, we have a history of net losses in some periods and net income in other periods. We have a significant accumulated deficit. Were we to experience net losses again, our ability to comply with the 2017 Credit Agreement and continue to operate our business as it is presently conducted, could be jeopardized.\nWe reported net income attributable to common stockholders of $29.3 million and had positive cash flow from operations of $65.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. We reported net loss attributable to common stockholders of $3.9 million and had positive cash flow from operations of $63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $522.5 million. If we were to experience net losses and/or declining net revenue over a period of time, there could be an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources. In addition, if events or circumstances occur such that we were not able to generate positive cash flow and operate our business as it is presently conducted, we may be required to obtain additional equity or debt financing, refinance our existing debt, sell assets and/or curtail certain operations. There is no assurance that any such transactions, if required, could be consummated on terms satisfactory to us or at all. Any default under our 2017 Credit Facility, or inability to renegotiate such agreements or obtain additional financing if needed, would have a material adverse effect on our overall business and financial condition.\nOur ability to generate the significant amount of cash needed to service our indebtedness and financial obligations and our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing depends on many factors beyond our control. In addition, we may not be able to pay amounts due on our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding total indebtedness of approximately $214.2 million. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness, including the amounts borrowed under our 2017 Credit Facility and other financial obligations, and to fund our operations, depends on our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow. Our cash flow generation will depend on our future performance, which is subject to many factors, including prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available to us under our 2017 Credit Facility or otherwise, in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness, including the borrowings under our 2017 Credit Facility, or to fund our other liquidity needs. If events or circumstances occur such that we are not able to generate positive cash flow and operate our business as it is presently conducted, we may be required to refinance our existing indebtedness, sell assets, curtail certain operations and/or obtain additional equity or debt financing. There is no assurance that any such transactions, if required, could be consummated on terms satisfactory to us or at all. Because of these and other factors beyond our control, we may be unable to pay the principal, premium, if any, interest or other amounts on our indebtedness.\nIf we cannot raise required capital, we may have to reduce or curtail certain existing operations.\nWe require significant additional capital for general working capital and debt service needs. If our cash flow and existing working capital are not sufficient to fund our general working capital and debt service requirements, we will have to raise additional funds by selling equity, issuing debt, refinancing some or all of our existing debt, selling assets or subsidiaries and/or curtailing certain operations. None of these alternatives for raising additional funds may be available, or available on terms satisfactory to us, in amounts sufficient for us to meet our requirements. In addition, our ability to raise additional funds and engage in acquisitions and divestitures is limited by the terms of the 2017 Credit Agreement. Our failure to obtain any required new financing may, if needed, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur advertising revenue can vary substantially from period to period based on many factors beyond our control, including but not limited to those discussed herein. This volatility affects our operating results and may reduce our ability to repay indebtedness or reduce the market value of our securities.\nWe rely on sales of advertising time for most of our revenues and, as a result, our operating results are sensitive to the amount of advertising revenue we generate. If we generate less revenue, it may be more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness and the value of our business may decline. Our ability to sell advertising time depends on:\n\u2022the levels of advertising, which can fluctuate between and among industry groups and in general, based on industry and general economic conditions;\n\u2022for our television and audio segment, the health of the economy in the markets where our television and radio stations are located and in the nation as a whole, and for our digital segment, the health of the economy in the markets where our digital advertising customers, publishers and audiences are located, and globally as a whole;\n\u2022the popularity of our programming and that of our competition;\n\u2022changes in the makeup of the population in the markets where our stations are located;\n\u2022the activities of our competitors, including increased competition from other forms of advertising-based mediums, such as other broadcast television stations, radio stations, MVPDs, Internet and broadband content providers, and publishers and digital advertising technology companies serving in the same markets;\n\u2022changes in advertising choices and placements in different media, such as new media, compared to traditional media such as television and radio;\n\u2022revenue in our digital segment depends significantly on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technology, as well as consumer preferences and expectations as a result thereof; and\n\u2022other factors that may be beyond our control.\nThe 2017 Credit Agreement contains various covenants that limit management\u2019s discretion in the operation of our business and could limit our ability to grow and compete.\nSubject to certain exceptions, the 2017 Credit Agreement contains covenants that limit the ability of us and our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022incur liens on our property or assets;\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022consummate any merger, dissolution, liquidation, consolidation or sale of substantially all our assets;\n\u2022make certain acquisitions;\n\u2022dispose of certain assets;\n\u2022make certain restricted payments;\n\u2022enter into substantially different lines of business;\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022use loan proceeds to purchase or carry margin stock or for any other prohibited purpose;\n\u2022change or amend the terms of our organizational documents or the organization documents of certain restricted subsidiaries in a materially adverse way to the lenders, or change or amend the terms of certain indebtedness;\n\u2022enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022make prepayments of any subordinated indebtedness, subject to certain conditions; and\n\u2022change our fiscal year, or accounting policies or reporting practices.\nMoreover, if we fail to comply with certain customary terms of default under the 2017 Credit Agreement, our lenders could:\n\u2022elect to declare all amounts borrowed to be immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest; and/or\n\u2022terminate their commitments, if any, to make further extensions of credit.\nAny such action by our lenders would have a material adverse effect on our overall business and financial condition.\nUncertain or adverse economic conditions may have a negative impact on our industry, business, results of operations or financial position.\nUncertain or adverse economic conditions could have a negative effect on the fundamentals of our business, results of operations and/or financial position. These conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industry of those customers who advertise on our stations, including, among others, the automotive, services, healthcare, retail, travel, restaurants, and telecommunications industries, which provide a significant amount of our advertising revenue. There can be no assurance that we will not experience any material adverse effect on our business as a result of current or future economic conditions or that the actions of the United States Government, Federal Reserve or other governmental and regulatory bodies for the purpose of stimulating the economy or financial markets will achieve their intended effect. Additionally, some of these actions may adversely affect financial institutions, capital providers, advertisers or other consumers or our financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our securities. Potential consequences of the foregoing include:\n\u2022the financial condition of companies that advertise on our stations, including, among others, those in the automotive, services, healthcare, retail, travel, restaurants, and telecommunications industries, which may file for bankruptcy protection or face severe cash flow issues, may result in a further significant decline in our advertising revenue;\n\u2022our ability to borrow capital on terms and conditions that we find satisfactory, or at all, may be limited, which could limit our ability to refinance our existing debt;\n\u2022potential increased costs of borrowing capital if interest rates rise;\n\u2022our ability to pursue permitted acquisitions or divestitures of television or radio assets may be limited, both as a result of these factors and, with respect to acquisitions and dispositions, limitations contained in the 2017 Credit Agreement;\n\u2022the possible further impairment of some or all of the value of our syndicated programming, goodwill and other intangible assets, including our broadcast licenses; and\n\u2022the possibility that our lenders under our 2017 Credit Facility could refuse to fund its commitment to us or could fail, and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lender on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nActual or perceived difficulties in the global capital and credit markets have adversely affected, and uncertain or adverse economic conditions may negatively affect, our business, as well as the industries of many of our customers, which are cyclical in nature.\nSome of the markets in which our advertisers operate, such as the services, telecommunications, automotive, fast food and restaurants, and retail industries, are cyclical in nature, thus posing a risk to us which is beyond our control. A decline in consumer and business confidence and spending, together with significant reductions in the availability and increases in the cost of credit and volatility in the capital and credit markets, could adversely affect the business and economic environment in which we operate, which in turn can affect the profitability of our business. Our business is significantly exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our key advertisers and other strategic business partners. These conditions have resulted, from time to time in the past, and could again result, in financial instability or other adverse effects at many of our advertisers and other strategic business partners. The consequences of such adverse effects could include the delay or cancellation of customer advertising orders, cancellation of our programming and termination of facilities that broadcast or re-broadcast our programming. The recurrence of any of these conditions may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability and financial condition. Future disruption of the credit markets, increases in interest rates and/or sluggish economic growth in future periods could adversely affect our customers\u2019 access to or cost of credit, which supports the continuation and expansion of their businesses, and could result in advertising cancellations or suspensions, payment delays or defaults by our customers.\nThe current uncertain economic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the continuing effects of the pandemic may have an adverse impact on our industry, business, results of operations and financial position.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a severe interruption in daily life and business throughout the United States and around the world, causing concerns about the extent and duration of the resulting economic environment. The continuation or worsening of current economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the fundamentals of our business, results of operations and financial position. These conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industry of those customers who advertise on our stations, including, among others, the automotive, services, healthcare, retail, travel, restaurant and telecommunications industries, which provide a significant amount of our advertising revenue, or who advertise through the purchase of digital advertising in our digital segment. There can be no assurance that we will not experience any further material adverse effect on our business as a result of the current economic environment or that the actions of the United States Government, Federal Reserve or other U.S. or foreign governmental and regulatory bodies for the purpose of addressing any resurgence of the pandemic, or stabilizing economies or financial markets will achieve their intended effect.\nPotential consequences of the foregoing include:\n\u2022the financial condition of companies that advertise on our stations, including, among others, those in the automotive, services, healthcare, retail, travel, restaurants, and telecommunications industries, which may file for bankruptcy protection or face severe cash flow issues, may result in a further significant decline in our advertising revenue;\n\u2022the financial condition of companies that advertise on our stations, including, among others, those in the automotive, services, healthcare, retail, travel, restaurant and telecommunications industries, which may file for bankruptcy protection or face severe cash flow problems, may result in a significant decline in our advertising revenue;\n\u2022the financial condition of advertising customers or their ad agencies that purchase digital advertising from us in our digital segment;\n\u2022our ability to borrow capital on terms and conditions that we find acceptable, or at all, may be limited as a result of liquidity restrictions at financial institutions and others, which could limit our ability to meet our expenses as they become due;\n\u2022the possible further impairment of some or all of the value of our tangible assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, including our digital assets and broadcast licenses;\n\u2022our ability to pursue permitted acquisitions or divestitures may be limited, both as a result of these factors and due to restrictions contained in the 2017 Credit Agreement; and\n\u2022the possibility that one or more of the lenders under our 2017 Credit Facility could refuse to fund its commitment to us or could fail, and we may not be able to replace the financing commitment of any such lenders on favorable terms, or at all.\nThe current economic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the continuing effects of that environment, and its impact on consumer and general business confidence, could negatively affect us.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created increasingly difficult operational and financial conditions for companies globally. If the current and possible continuing conditions are similar to previous recessions and severe economic downturns, consumer confidence could decline, and business and consumer spending could be curtailed, and could remain so, for an extended period. Consumer purchases of advertising time are sensitive to these conditions and may decline in future periods where disposable income is adversely affected or there is economic uncertainty. The tightening of credit in financial markets also adversely affects the ability of our customers to obtain financing for advertising purchases.\nAdverse or uncertain general economic conditions may cause potential customers to cancel, defer or forgo the purchase of advertising time. The consequences of such adverse or uncertain conditions could also include cancellation of our programming and termination of facilities that broadcast or re-broadcast our programming. Moreover, insolvencies associated with the economic crisis resulting from the pandemic could adversely affect our business through the loss of carriers and clients or by hampering our ability to sell advertising or generate retransmission consent revenue. Additionally, reduced levels of staffing due to possible layoffs could also have a negative impact on our business by spreading our personnel resources too thinly and not being able to cover all of our customer markets as effectively as in most economically robust periods. The occurrence of any one or more of these conditions may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, profitability and financial condition.\nCurrent uncertain economic conditions may affect our financial performance or our ability to forecast or budget for our business with accuracy.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on U.S. and, increasingly, international, economic conditions and their impact on purchases of advertising by our customers. As a result of the economic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, general economic conditions may not improve, or even deteriorate significantly, through future periods in 2022 and possibly beyond, depending upon the extent and duration of the pandemic and the rate at which economies recover. As a result, economic conditions may remain volatile and uncertain for the foreseeable future.\nWe believe that if this uncertainty continues in future periods, our customers may alter their purchasing activities in response to the new economic reality, and, among other things, our customers may change or scale back future purchases of advertising. This uncertainty may also affect our ability to prepare accurate financial forecasts or meet specific forecasted results. It is currently unclear as to what overall effect the current economic conditions and uncertainties will continue to have on the marketplace and our future business. If we are unable to adequately respond to or forecast further changes in demand for advertising if current economic conditions persist or deteriorate further, our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets.\nGoodwill and intangible assets totaled $344.8 million and $324.1 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily attributable to acquisitions in prior years. At the date of these acquisitions, the fair value of the acquired goodwill and intangible assets equaled its book value.\nGoodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are tested annually on October 1 for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that our assets might be impaired. Such circumstances may include, among other things, a significant decrease in our operating performance, decrease in prevailing broadcast transaction multiples, deterioration in broadcasting industry revenues, adverse market conditions, a significant decrease in our market capitalization, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the products or services sold by our businesses and a variety of other factors. Appraisals of any of our reporting units or changes in estimates of our future cash flows could affect our impairment analysis in future periods and cause us to record either an additional expense for impairment of assets previously determined to be impaired or record an expense for impairment of other assets. Depending on future circumstances, we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets. Any determination of impairment of our goodwill or other intangibles could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and operating results.\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and our financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenue\nand expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those relating to the valuation of intangible assets, investments, income taxes, stock-based compensation, reserves, litigation and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable at the time we make those assumptions, based on specific circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from our estimated results. Additionally, changes in accounting standards, assumptions or estimates may have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe expect to experience fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in our overseas operations, which may increase if and as our overseas operations expand.\nOur digital segment engages in business operations involving a large number of currencies.\nOur consolidated financial statements of our operations outside the United States are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period. To the extent that the U.S. Dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currencies denominated transactions will result in reduced revenue, operating expenses and net income for our international operations. Similarly, to the extent that the U.S. Dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased revenue, operating expenses and net income for our international operations. We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign operations into U.S. Dollars in consolidation. In addition, we may have certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity\u2019s functional currency. Changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations that will lead to a transaction gain or loss. Moreover, some of the countries in which our digital segment operates, including Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, have experienced significant and sometimes sudden devaluations of their currency over time, which could magnify these fluctuations, should they happen again in the future.\nRegulatory Risks\nLegislation and regulation of digital media businesses, including privacy and data protection regimes, could create unexpected costs, subject us to enforcement actions for compliance failures, or cause us to change our digital media technology platform or business model.\nU.S. and foreign governments have enacted, considered or are currently considering legislation or regulations that relate to digital advertising, including, for example, the online collection and use of anonymous user data and unique device identifiers, such as IP address or unique mobile device identifiers, geo-location data, biometric data, and other privacy and data protection regulation. Some authorities have applied competition rules to regulate digital advertising practices which may result in structural changes to advertising practices. Congress in the United States and legislatures in other countries and communities are considering legislation that would structurally regulate digital advertising and the platforms that support such advertising, potentially disrupting the current markets for digital advertising services. Such legislation or regulations could increase the costs of doing business online, and could reduce the demand for our digital solutions or otherwise adversely affect our digital operations. For example, a wide variety of state, national and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. While we take measures to protect the security of information that we collect, use and disclose in the operation of our business, such measures may not always be effective. Data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and could result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. In addition, it is possible that these laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our business practices. These laws and regulations may impose obligations that are inconsistent with or interfere with our ability to comply with other legal obligations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with U.S. federal, state, or international laws, including laws and regulations governing privacy, data security or consumer protection, could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities, consumers or others. Any such proceedings could force us to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract our management, result in fines or require us to pay significant monetary damages, damage our reputation, adversely affect the demand for our services, increase our costs of doing business or otherwise cause us to change our business practices or limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our digital operations. Because we, at times, rely on third parties to perform functions on our behalf, non-compliance by these third parties with laws and regulations relating to the services they provide to us, as well as their failure to secure adequately the information that we entrust to them, may subject us to additional legal exposure. The increased regulatory scrutiny of data practices has complicated the process of engaging third party service providers and performing due diligence and supplier management processes, and limited some parties\u2019 willingness to share, process or store data that supports consumer marketing and advertising, adversely affecting the financial results of such business activities.\nIf we cannot renew our FCC broadcast licenses, our broadcast operations would be impaired.\nOur television and radio businesses depend upon maintaining our broadcast licenses, which are issued by the FCC. The FCC has the authority to renew licenses, not renew them, renew them only with significant qualifications, including renewals for less than a full term, or revoke them. Although we have to date renewed all our FCC licenses in the ordinary course, we cannot assure investors that our future renewal applications will be approved, or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications that could adversely affect our operations. Failing to renew any of our stations\u2019 main licenses would prevent us from operating the affected stations, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we renew our licenses with substantial conditions or modifications (including renewing one or more of our licenses for less than the standard term of eight years), it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure to maintain our FCC broadcast licenses could cause a default under our 2017 Credit Facility and cause an acceleration of our indebtedness.\nOur 2017 Credit Facility requires us to maintain our FCC licenses. If the FCC were to revoke any of our material licenses, our lender could declare all amounts outstanding under the 2017 Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to pay the amounts owed.\nDisplacement of any of our low-power television stations (other than Class A stations) could cause our ratings and revenue for any such station to decrease.\nWe own and operate a number of television stations in the FCC\u2019s low-power television service. Our low-power television stations operate with less power and coverage than our full-power stations. The FCC rules under which we operate provide that low-power television stations (but not our Class A television stations) are treated as a secondary service. If any or all of our low-power stations are found to cause interference to full-power stations or sufficient channels become unavailable to accommodate incumbent broadcast television stations, owing to the relocation of full-power stations to fewer channels as part of the incentive auction repacking process, we could be required to eliminate the interference, terminate service, or consider other options, including channel sharing arrangements. In a few urban markets where we operate, including San Diego, there are a limited number of alternative channels to which our low-power television stations can migrate. As a result of the elimination of part of the broadcast spectrum or otherwise, we conducted a review of our low-power television stations that resulted in the return of certain of our licenses as we sort to optimize our low-power station portfolio.\nBecause our full-power television stations rely on retransmission consent rights to obtain MVPD carriage, new laws or regulations that eliminate or limit the scope of our MVPD carriage rights or affect how we negotiate our agreements, could have a material adverse impact on our television operations.\nWe no longer rely on \u201cmust carry\u201d rights to obtain the retransmission of our full-power television stations on MVPDs. New laws or regulations could affect retransmission consent rights and the negotiating process between broadcasters and MVPDs and this may affect our negotiating strategies and the economic results we achieve in such negotiations. For instance, the inability of non-common owners of television stations in a television market to negotiate with MVPDs has an impact on our negotiating arrangements with TelevisaUnivision.\nAs we have come to the end of the term of our carriage agreement with TelevisaUnivision, for certain of our markets, we have had to confront retransmission consent agreements that are conditioned on the carriage of Univision or UniM\u00e1s Network programming. In the absence of such programming, our stations in affected markets have faced the loss of carriage on MVPDs until the commencement of the next carriage election cycle, where we may choose to elect must carry treatment.\nOur low-power television stations do not have MVPD \u201cmust carry\u201d rights. Some of our low-power television stations are carried on MVPDs as they provide broadcast programming the MVPDs desire or are part of the retransmission consent agreements we are party to. Where MVPDs are not contractually required to carry our low-power stations, we face future uncertainty with respect to the availability of MVPD carriage for our low-power television stations.\nCarriage of our signals on DBS services is subject to DBS companies providing local broadcast signals in the television markets we serve and our decision as to the terms upon which our signals will be carried.\nSHVIA allowed DBS television companies, which are currently AT&T/DirecTV and Dish Network, to transmit local broadcast television station signals back to their subscribers in local markets. In exchange for this privilege, however, SHVIA required that in television markets in which a DBS company elects to pick up and retransmit any local broadcast station signals, the DBS provider must also offer to its subscribers signals from all other qualified local broadcast television stations in that market. Our broadcast\ntelevision stations in markets for which DBS operators have elected to carry local stations have previously obtained carriage under this \u201ccarry one/carry all\u201d rule.\nSHVIA expired in 2004 and Congress adopted SHVERA, which expired in 2009, but was extended in May 2010 by STELA. STELA and STELAR provide further five-year extensions. The TVPA has made these provisions permanent. To the extent we have decided to secure our carriage on DBS through retransmission consent agreements, the \u201ccarry one/carry all\u201d rule no longer is relevant to us.\nChanges in the FCC\u2019s ownership rules could lead to increased market power for our competitors or could place limits on our ability to acquire stations in certain markets.\nAs required by the Communications Act and as the regulator of over-the-air broadcasting, the FCC, both on a quadrennial basis and in individual proceedings, continues to review its policies for the ownership of both radio and television stations. To date, however, only a reduction in the nationwide television cap, to 39% of the viewing public, has been the subject of federal legislation. The impact of changes in the FCC\u2019s rules as to how many stations a party may own, operate and/or control, and how these are counted, depends on whether the FCC expands its ownership limits, as it has done in the past, or adopts new limits on ownership, as it has also done as in the case of time brokerage and joint sales agreements. In the case of the former, expanding ownership limits could result in our competitors\u2019 ability to increase their ownership presence in the markets in which we operate. In the case of the latter, as has been discussed herein in connection with the UHF discount and attribution of joint sales agreements, we may be unable to acquire stations in markets where additional station ownership would enable us to achieve operating efficiencies or grow our broadcasting business. The 2014 Quadrennial Review resulted in the adoption of changes to the FCC\u2019s ownership rules that we had deemed favorable to us.\nWe rely on over-the-air spectrum which is being altered in connection in the incentive auction context, the results of which may affect the broadcasting services in general and our operations in particular.\nOur television business operates through over-the-air transmission of broadcast signals. These transmissions are authorized under licenses issued to our stations by the FCC. The current electromagnetic spectrum is finite and certain parts of the spectrum are better than others owing to the ability of electromagnetic signals to penetrate buildings. This is the portion of the spectrum where broadcast stations operate.\nWith the advent of mobile wireless communications and its use not only for voice but for broadband distribution, the need for spectrum has grown. The FCC has sought to increase the amount of spectrum available for use by wireless broadband services at the expense of over-the-air broadcast services. Available sources of such spectrum are limited and the spectrum allotted for television broadcasting as a source for such spectrum repurposing has been identified as containing spectrum that the FCC seeks to recover in part and make available for wireless broadband use. The FCC has completed an incentive auction involving relinquishing and repurposing broadcast spectrum usage rights that have been auctioned off for what is expected to be wireless service use. While existing broadcasters that did not relinquish spectrum usage rights as part of the incentive auction are entitled to have their service protected, the future of broadcasting with a smaller and repacked broadcast band is now a reality. In this regard, it cannot be certain how the FCC\u2019s efforts to secure additional spectrum for mobile wireless communications and the incentive auction, including the results of our participation in the incentive auction process and repacking processes that accompanied the redistribution of reduced broadcast spectrum, will affect television broadcasting in general and our operations in particular. There are significant political, legal and technical issues to overcome and be considered by us as the changes in spectrum operation and usage occur. We are giving consideration to all of the implications of these changes.\nWe must comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nWe are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in certain countries, including some of the countries in which we operate. If our competitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of some companies, giving our competitors an advantage in securing business or from government officials who might give them priority in obtaining new business, which would put us at a disadvantage. Although we inform our personnel that such practices are illegal, we cannot assure you that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties.\nInvestor Risks\nOur Chief Executive Officer currently has control of our company, giving him the ability to determine the outcome of most actions by our company and its stockholders, including the election of all of our company's directors.\nAs of March 9, 2022, Walter F. Ulloa, and stockholders affiliated with him, collectively hold approximately 59.1% of the voting power of our common stock. Under Delaware law, these stockholders, by themselves, have the power to elect all the directors of our company and determine the outcome of most matters placed before the stockholders for action.\nStockholders who desire to change control of our company may be prevented from doing so by provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the 2017 Credit Agreement. In addition, other agreements contain provisions that could discourage a takeover.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or our certificate of incorporation, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. The provisions of our certificate of incorporation could diminish the opportunities for a stockholder to participate in tender offers. In addition, under our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors may issue preferred stock on terms that could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company. The issuance of preferred stock could also negatively affect the voting power of holders of our common stock. The provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of discouraging or preventing an acquisition or sale of our business.\nIn addition, the 2017 Credit Agreement contains limitations on our ability to enter into a change of control transaction. Under the 2017 Credit Agreement, the occurrence of a change of control would constitute an event of default permitting acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness.\nThe terms of any additional equity or convertible debt financing could contain terms that are superior to the rights of our existing security holders.\nDepending upon our future results of operations, and our ability to further reduce costs as necessary and comply with our financing agreements, we may require additional equity or debt financing. If future funds are raised through issuance of stock or convertible debt, these securities could have rights, privileges and preference senior to those of common stock. The sale of additional equity securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for equity securities could also result in dilution to our current stockholders. There can be no assurance that additional financing, if required, will be available on terms satisfactory to us or at all.\nAvailable Information\nWe make available free of charge on our corporate website, www.entravision.com, the following reports, and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC:\n\u2022our annual report on Form 10-K;\n\u2022our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q; and\n\u2022our current reports on Form 8-K.\nThe information on our website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part of this report or incorporated by reference into this or any other filing we make with the SEC.", "PERMNO": 88485, "SIC": 4833, "TIC": "EVC"}
