{"cik": "1629261", "company": "Long Blockchain Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-04-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding to invest in our securities, you should carefully consider the risks described below. These risks and uncertainties are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, you may lose all or part of your investment in the securities.\nRisks Related to Our Blockchain Business\nWe have virtually no operating history as a Blockchain business, which makes it hard to evaluate our ability to generate revenue through operations, and at the date of this filing, we have not generated revenue from any Blockchain-based products.\nOur minimal operating history as a Blockchain business makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly developing and changing industries, including challenges in forecasting accuracy, determining appropriate uses of our limited resources, gaining market acceptance, managing a complex regulatory landscape and developing new products. Our current operating model may require changes in order for us to scale our operations efficiently. Investors in our common stock should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties it faces as an early-stage company focused on developing products in the field of financial technology. To date, we have focused on developing our business and exploring opportunities for novel applications of Blockchain technology. As a result of our early stage of development, we have not generated revenue from any commercially available Blockchain-based products. We have generated no revenue as a Blockchain business.\nOur management has relatively little experience in the blockchain technology industry.\nOur management only recently determined to shift our primary corporate focus towards the exploration of, and investment in, opportunities that leverage the benefits of Blockchain technology. Our management has limited experience in the Blockchain technology industry. While we intend to expand our staff with individuals with more experience in this industry and will closely scrutinize any individuals we engage, we cannot assure you that well-qualified individuals will be available to us or that our assessment of individuals we retain will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of being involved in a public company which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect our operations.\nWe expect to develop new Blockchain-based products, but as of the date of this filing we have not commenced such development.\nWe intend to develop new Blockchain-based products covering all aspects of the Blockchain eco-system. However, at the date of this filing, we have not commenced development of any such products. Although we have entered into the Hashcove Agreement to acquire Hashcove, which is developing certain Blockchain-based products, there can be no assurance that we will consummate such acquisition. In addition, Hashcove is only in the preliminary stages of development of its Blockchain-based products. The development of such products implicates complex technological considerations and raises numerous legal and regulatory issues that will need to be addressed. As a result of these technological, legal and regulatory considerations, the Blockchain-based products may never be developed and, if developed, may, for a variety of technological, legal and regulatory reasons, never become operational.\nEven if we successfully develop our Blockchain-based products, we may not be able to successfully market and launch them.\nOur Blockchain-based products, if successfully developed, may not meet customer or user expectations. Furthermore, despite good faith efforts to develop and complete the launch of, and subsequently to maintain, such products, it is possible that they will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately maintained. We may not have or may not be able to obtain the technical skills, expertise, or regulatory approvals needed to successfully develop our Blockchain-based products and progress them to a successful launch. While we are seeking to retain, or acquire businesses who have retained, experts, there may, from time to time, be a general scarcity of management, technical, scientific, research and marketing personnel with appropriate training to develop and maintain such products. In addition, there are significant legal and regulatory considerations that will need to be addressed in order to develop and maintain such products, and addressing such considerations will require significant time and resources. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop products that achieves our goals and satisfy the complex regulatory requirements that are applicable. If we are not successful in our efforts to develop products that are compliant with all regulatory and legal requirements and to demonstrate to customers and users the utility and value of the products, it may be impermissible to launch the products or there may not be sufficient demand for the launch of the products to be commercially viable, and our business would be materially adversely affected.\nOur Blockchain-based products, if successfully developed and launched, may not function properly.\nOur Blockchain technology may not function properly, which would have a material adverse effect on our plans, operations and financial condition. We intend to build Blockchain-based products covering all aspects of the Blockchain eco-system, but if our technology does not work as anticipated, there may be no satisfactory alternative available. Any problems in the functionality of our technology would have a direct materially adverse effect on our plans and expectations for revenues. The technology may malfunction because of internal problems or as a result of cyber-attacks or external security breaches. Any such technological problems would have a material adverse effect on our prospects.\nOur Blockchain-based products, if successfully developed and launched, may not be widely adopted and may have limited users.\nIt is possible that our Blockchain-based products, if successfully developed and launched, will not be used by a large number of customers or users. In addition, legal and regulatory developments could render the products obsolete or impermissible. Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the effectiveness of the products, and our business and financial position.\nWe intend to offer advisory services to companies considering or pursuing ICOs, but we have not yet been engaged to do so.\nWe intend to offer advisory services to companies considering or pursuing ICOs. To date, we have not been engaged to provide advisory services to any other company considering or pursuing an ICO, and there can be no assurance that we will be engaged to provide any such services in the future or that any such services, if provided, will be profitable. If we are engaged to provide any such services, we could face claims from any dissatisfied clients and could incur liabilities in rendering any such services, any of which could also damage our reputation and adversely affect other parts of our business.\nThe popularity of digital assets and cryptocurrencies and ICOs may decrease in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the digital asset cryptocurrency industry and our operations and financial condition.\nWe intend to develop and commercialize financial technology based on the use of digital assets, cryptocurrencies and Blockchain technology. In recent years, digital assets and cryptocurrencies have become more widely accepted among investors and financial institutions, but have been also faced increasingly complex legal and regulatory challenges and, to date, have not benefited from widespread adoption by governments, central banks or established financial institutions. However, any significant decrease in the acceptance or popularity of digital asset or cryptocurrency or ICOs may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition and a material adverse effect on us.\nAcquisitions we have made and may make will increase costs and regulatory and integration risks.\nWe have purchased interests in SBL and TSLC. In addition, we may from time to time purchase interests in or acquire other businesses or the assets of other businesses. Integrating an acquired business or its assets involves a number of risks and financial, managerial and operational challenges. We may incur significant expenses in connection with purchases or acquisitions it has made in the past or may make in the future. Further, acquisitions may also create a need for additional accounting, tax, compliance, documentation, risk management and internal control procedures, and may require us to hire additional personnel to implement, perform and/or monitor such procedures. To the extent our procedures are not adequate to appropriately implement, perform and/or monitor all necessary procedures relating to any new or expanded business, we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.\nIf we do not keep pace with technological changes, our solutions may become less competitive and our business may suffer.\nThe market for Blockchain technology is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product and service innovation and evolving industry standards. If we are unable to provide enhancements and new features for our future product offerings that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with these technological developments, our business could be adversely affected. The success of enhancements, new features and solutions depends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction and market acceptance of the enhancements or new features or solutions. Failure in this regard may significantly impair our revenue growth. In addition, we may need to continuously modify and enhance our solutions to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market in a timely fashion. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of our solutions to keep pace with technological changes or operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies could reduce the demand for our solutions, result in customer dissatisfaction and adversely affect our business.\nWe may face substantial competition from a number of known and unknown competitors as well as the risk that one or more of them may obtain patents covering technology critical to the operation of our products.\nWe believe that a number of organizations are or may be working to develop products systems utilizing distributed ledger or Blockchain technologies or other novel technologies that may be competitive to the technology we intend to develop. Some or all of such organizations may have substantially greater technological expertise, experience with distributed ledger technologies and/or financial resources than we have, and they may attempt to patent technologies that may be competitive with or similar to the technology we ultimately use. If one or more other persons, companies or organizations, individually or together obtain a substantial share of our intended market, or obtain a valid patent covering technology critical to our products, and we are unable or unwilling to license the technology, we may be unable to sell our products or it could become impossible for our products to operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nAdverse economic conditions or reduced technology spending may adversely impact our business.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for technology and on the economic health of our prospective customers. In general, worldwide economic conditions remain unstable, and these conditions may make it difficult for our prospective customers and us to forecast and plan future business activities accurately, and they could cause our prospective customers to reevaluate their decision to purchase our solutions. Weak global economic conditions, or a reduction in technology spending even if economic conditions improve, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways, including longer sales cycles, lower prices for our solutions, reduced bookings and lower or no growth.\nOur ability to attract, train and retain qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and any future growth.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these individuals is intense, especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and internet-related services, senior sales executives and professional services personnel with appropriate financial reporting experience. We have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees have breached their legal obligations or that we have induced such breaches, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur planned products and any Blockchain on which our products may rely may be the target of malicious cyber-attacks or may contain exploitable flaws in its underlying code, which may result in security breaches and the loss or theft of digital assets. If such attacks occur or security is compromised, this could expose us to liability and reputational harm and could seriously curtail the utilization of our products and cause a decline in the market price of the digital assets on that system, and could result in claims against us.\nIf our products are successfully developed and launched, our software, the software applications and other interfaces or applications upon which they rely, and any software that may be built upon our products, will be unproven, and there can be no assurances that our products and the creating, transfer or storage of digital assets on our products will be uninterrupted or fully secure, which may result in impermissible transfers, a complete loss of users\u2019 digital assets on that system or an unwillingness of customers and users to access, adopt and utilize our products. Further, the digital assets with which are products are used (and any technology, including Blockchain technology, on which they rely) may also be the target of malicious attacks seeking to identify and exploit weaknesses in the software, the digital assets or our products, which may result in the loss or theft of digital assets on that system. Such attacks may come in anticipated forms or unanticipated forms.\nWe and our subsidiaries are, and our products, if developed and launched, and the Blockchain technology to be utilized by our products will be, subject to cyber-attacks, security risks and risks of security breaches. An attack on any of them or a breach of security of any of them could result in a loss of private data, unauthorized trades, and an interruption of trading for an extended period of time. Any such attack or breach could adversely affect our ability to effectively operate or sell our Blockchain products, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Such an attack may also damage our reputation and any breach of data security that exposes or compromises the security of any of the private digital keys used to authorize or validate transaction orders, or that enables any unauthorized person to generate any of the private digital keys, could result in unauthorized trades. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could result in claims against us and us and could have a material adverse effect on us and the holders of our securities.\nThe regulatory regime governing Blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, digital assets, and offerings of digital assets is uncertain, and any new regulations or policies, may materially adversely affect the development and the value of such cryptocurrencies and assets.\nRegulation of digital assets, cryptocurrencies, Blockchain technologies, and cryptocurrency exchanges is currently undeveloped and likely to rapidly evolve as government agencies take greater interest in them. Regulation also varies significantly among international, federal, state and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty. Various legislative and executive bodies in the United States and in other countries may in the future adopt laws, regulations, or guidance, or take other actions, which may severely impact the permissibility of digital assets and cryptocurrencies generally and the technology behind them or the means of transaction or in transferring them. Failure by us to comply with any laws, rules and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines.\nCryptocurrency networks, distributed ledger technologies, and coin and token offerings also face an uncertain regulatory landscape in many foreign jurisdictions. Various foreign jurisdictions may, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that may conflict with those of the United States or may directly and negatively impact our business. The effect of any future regulatory change is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and materially adverse to our business.\nOn July 25, 2017 the SEC released an investigative report which states that the United States would, in some circumstances, consider the offer and sale of blockchain tokens pursuant to an ICO subject to federal securities laws. Thereafter, China released statements and took similar actions. Although the Company does not currently participate in ICOs, we intend to do so in the future, and these actions may be a prelude to further action which chills widespread acceptance of Blockchain and cryptocurrency adoption and have a material adverse effect the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or operations of the Company.\nOur business will be subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, technology, data protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations or otherwise harm our business.\nWe will be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including user privacy, Blockchain technology, data protection and intellectual property, among others. Foreign data protection, privacy and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. These U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate.\nWe will adopt policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws. The growth of our business and its expansion outside of the United States may increase the potential of violating these laws or our internal policies and procedures. The risk of our being found in violation of these or other laws and regulations is further increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action brought against us for violation of these or other laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws and regulations, we may be subject to any applicable penalty associated with the violation, including civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines, we could be required to refund payments received by it, and we could be required to curtail or cease our operations. Any of the foregoing consequences could seriously harm our business and its financial results. These existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the development of new products, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to claims or other remedies, including fines or demands that we modify or ceases our planned business practices.\nThe further development and acceptance of Blockchain networks, which are part of a new and rapidly changing industry, are subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing or stopping of the development or acceptance of Blockchain networks and digital assets would have a material adverse effect on our business plans and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe growth of the Blockchain industry in general, as well as the Blockchain networks on which digital assets and cryptocurrencies rely, is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. The factors affecting the further development of the digital asset and cryptocurrency industry, as well as Blockchain networks, include, without limitation:\n\u25cf worldwide growth in the adoption and use of digital assets, cryptocurrencies and other Blockchain technologies;\n\u25cf government and quasi-government regulation of digital assets and cryptocurrencies and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access to and operation of Blockchain networks or similar systems;\n\u25cf the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of digital assets or cryptocurrency networks;\n\u25cf changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;\n\u25cf the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services, or trading assets including new means of using government-backed currencies or existing networks;\n\u25cf general economic conditions and the regulatory environment relating to digital assets and cryptocurrencies; and\n\u25cf a decline in the popularity or acceptance of digital assets, cryptocurrencies or other Blockchain-based tokens.\nThe digital asset and cryptocurrency industries as a whole have been characterized by rapid changes and innovations and are constantly evolving. Although it has experienced significant growth in recent years, the slowing or stopping of the development, general acceptance and adoption and usage of Bockchain networks and Blockchain assets may materially adversely affect our business plans.\nThe development and operation of our business, including any or our Blockchain-based products, will likely require technology and intellectual property rights.\nOur ability to develop and operate Blockchain-based products may depend on technology and intellectual property rights that we may license from unaffiliated third parties. If for any reason we were to fail to comply with our obligations under the applicable license agreement, or were unable to provide or were to fail to provide the technology and intellectual property that our products require, they would be unable to operate, which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe may be subject to claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, by offering allegedly infringing products or otherwise. Any claims may result in significant expenditure of our financial and managerial resources, and may result in us making significant damages or settlement payments or changes to our business. We could be prohibited from using software or business processes, or required to obtain licenses from third parties, which could be expensive or unavailable. Any such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and business.\nWe may be unable to protect our proprietary technology.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary intellectual property rights. We may be unable to protect it, in the United States or elsewhere, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBanks and financial institutions may not provide banking services, or may cut off services, to businesses that provide blockchain-related services or that accept cryptocurrencies as payment, including financial institutions of investors in the Company\u2019s securities.\nA number of companies that provide Blockchain-related services have been unable to find banks or financial institutions that are willing to provide them with bank accounts and other services. Similarly, a number of companies and individuals or businesses associated with Blockchain technologies may have had and may continue to have their existing bank accounts closed or services discontinued with financial institutions. We also may be unable to obtain or maintain these services for our business. The difficulty that many businesses that provide cryptocurrency and/or other Blockchain-related services have and may continue to have in finding banks and financial institutions willing to provide them services may be decreasing the usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a payment system and harming public perception of cryptocurrencies and could decrease its usefulness and harm its public perception in the future. Similarly, the usefulness of cryptocurrencies as a payment system and the public perception of Blockchain technologies could be damaged if banks or financial institutions were to close the accounts of businesses providing cryptocurrency and/or other Blockchain-related services. This could occur as a result of compliance risk, cost, government regulation or public pressure. The risk applies to securities firms, clearance and settlement firms, national stock and commodities exchanges, the over the counter market and the Depository Trust Company, which, if any of such entities adopts or implements similar policies, rules or regulations, could result in the inability of our investors to open or maintain stock or commodities accounts, including the ability to deposit, maintain or trade the Company\u2019s securities. Such factors would have a material adverse effect the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or operations of the Company and harm investors.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s shares could be subject to wide price swings since the value of cryptocurrencies may be subject to pricing risk and have historically been subject to wide swings in value.\nThe Company\u2019s shares are subject to arbitrary pricing factors that are not necessarily associated with traditional factors that influence stock prices or the value of non-cryptocurrency assets such as revenue, cashflows, profitability, growth prospects or business activity levels since the value and price, as determined by the investing public, may be influenced by future anticipated adoption or appreciation in value of cryptocurrencies or the Blockchain generally, factors over which the Company has little or no influence or control. The Company\u2019s share prices may also be subject to pricing volatility due to supply and demand factors associated with few or limited public company options for investment in the segment, which may benefit the Company in the near term and change over time.\nIn addition, the success of the Company, the Company\u2019s share price, and the interest in investors and the public in the Company as an early entrant into the Blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem may in large part be the result of the Company\u2019s early emergence as a publicly traded company in which holders of appreciated cryptocurrency have an opportunity to invest inflated cryptocurrency profits for shares of the Company, which could be perceived as a way to maintaining investing exposure to the Blockchain and cryptocurrency markets without exposing the investor to the risk in a particular cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency holders have realized exponential value due to large increases in the prices of cryptocurrencies and may seek to lock in cryptocurrency appreciation, which investing in the Company\u2019s securities may be perceived as a way to achieve that result, but may not continue in the future. As a result, the value of the Company\u2019s securities, and the value of cryptocurrencies generally may be more likely to fluctuate due to changing investor confidence in future appreciation (or depreciation) in market prices, profits from related or unrelated investments or holdings of cryptocurrency. Such factors or events would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, or on the price of the Company\u2019s securities, which would have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or operations of the Company and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies the Company holds or expects to acquire for its own account.\nIt may become illegal in the future to acquire, own, hold, sell or use cryptocurrencies, participate in the Blockchain or utilize similar digital assets in one or more countries, the ruling of which would adversely affect the Company.\nAlthough currently cryptocurrencies, the Blockchain and digital assets generally are not regulated or are lightly regulated in most countries, including the United States, one or more countries may take regulatory actions in the future that could severely restrict the right to acquire, own, hold, sell or use these digital assets or to exchange for fiat currency. Such restrictions may adversely affect the Company. Such circumstances would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern or to pursuing this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or operations of the Company and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies the Company holds or expects to acquire for its own account and harm investors.\nThe markets for Blockchain/cryptocurrency based assets may be illiquid, and may be subject to manipulation.\nDigital assets that are represented and trade on a ledger-based platform may not necessarily benefit from viable trading markets. Stock exchanges have listing requirements and vet issuers, requiring them to be subjected to rigorous listing standards and rules and monitoring investors transacting on such platform for fraud and other improprieties. These conditions may not necessarily be replicated on a distributed ledger platform, depending on the platform\u2019s controls and other policies. The more lenient a distributed ledger platform is about vetting issuers of digital assets or users that transact on the platform, the higher the potential risk for fraud or the manipulation of digital assets. These factors may decrease liquidity or volume, or increase volatility of digital securities or other assets trading on a ledger-based system, which may adversely affect the Company. Such circumstances would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern or to pursue this segment at all, which would have a material adverse effect on the business, prospects or operations of the Company and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies the Company holds or expects to acquire for its own account and harm investors.\nRisks Related to LIBB\u2019s Beverage Business\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, which could negatively affect our sales.\nOur industry is highly competitive. We compete with multinational corporations with significant financial resources, including Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. and Arizona Beverage Company. These competitors can use their resources and scale to rapidly respond to competitive pressures and changes in consumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities. We also compete against a variety of smaller, regional and private label manufacturers. Smaller companies may be more innovative, better able to bring new products to market and better able to quickly exploit and serve niche markets. Our inability to compete effectively could result in a decline in our sales. We are subject to competition from companies, including from some of our customers, that either currently manufacture or are developing products directly in competition with our products. These generic or store-branded products may be a less expensive option for consumers than our products making it more difficult to sell our product. As a result, we may have to reduce our prices or increase our spending on marketing, advertising and product innovation. Any of these could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nWe may not effectively respond to changing consumer preferences, trends, health concerns and other factors. If we do not effectively anticipate these trends, then quickly develop new products, our sales could suffer.\nConsumers\u2019 preferences can change due to a variety of factors, including aging of the population, social trends, negative publicity, economic downturn or other factors. If we do not effectively anticipate these trends and changing consumer preferences, then quickly develop new products in response, our sales could suffer. Developing and launching new products can be risky and expensive. We may not be successful in responding to changing markets and consumer preferences, and some of our competitors may be better able to respond to these changes, either of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nCosts for our raw materials may increase substantially, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nThe principal raw materials we use in our business are bottles, caps, labels, packaging materials, tea essence and tea base, sugar, natural flavors and other sweeteners, juice, electricity, fuel and water. The cost of the raw materials can fluctuate substantially. We may not be able to pass along any increases in such costs to our customers or consumers, which could negatively affect our business and financial performance. We presently do not mitigate our exposure to volatility in the prices of raw materials through the use of forward contracts, pricing agreements or other hedging arrangements.\nCertain raw materials we use are available only from a limited number of suppliers. In the event our suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements, we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases.\nMost of the raw materials we use are available from only a few suppliers. If these suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements, we could suffer shortages or substantial cost increases. Changing suppliers can require long lead times. The failure of our suppliers to meet our needs could occur for many reasons, including fires, natural disasters, weather, manufacturing problems, disease, crop failure, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, political instability and terrorism. A failure of supply could also occur due to suppliers\u2019 financial difficulties, including bankruptcy. Any significant interruption to supply or cost increase could substantially harm our business and financial performance.\nSubstantial disruption to production at our third party beverage co-packing facilities and our storage facilities could occur, which could disrupt or delay our production or cause us to incur substantially higher costs.\nOur products are currently produced by three established co-packing companies. A disruption in our production at, or our relationships with, our third party beverage co-packing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a disruption could occur at any of our storage facilities or those of our suppliers, co-packers or distributors. The disruption could occur for many reasons, including fire, natural disasters, weather, manufacturing problems, disease, strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation or terrorism. Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, each of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nWe rely, in part, on our third party beverage co-packing facilities to maintain the quality of our products. The failure or inability of this co-manufacturer to comply with the specifications and requirements of our products could result in product recall and could adversely affect our reputation.\nWe take great care in ensuring the quality and safety in the manufacture of our products. Our third-party co-manufacturer is required to maintain the quality of our products and to comply with our product specifications and requirements for certain certifications. Our third-party co-manufacturer is also required to comply with Food and Drug Administration requirements for manufacturing of our product. However, our products could still otherwise become contaminated. A contamination could occur in our operations or those of our bottlers, distributors or suppliers. This could result in expensive production interruptions, recalls and liability claims. Moreover, negative publicity could be generated from false, unfounded or nominal liability claims or limited recalls. Any of these failures or occurrences could negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nWe may be subject to litigation. The cost of defending against such litigation and the negative publicity related to such litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time in the normal course of our business operations, we may become subject to litigation that may result in liability or negatively affect our operating results. The cost to defend such litigation may be significant and may require a diversion of our resources. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information, see the item \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in the Annual Report and Quarterly Reports.\nFluctuations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter could have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition and results of operations.\nWe experience seasonal fluctuations in revenues and operating income. Historically, sales during the second and third fiscal quarters have generally been the highest. Any factors that harm our second or third quarter operating results, including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions, could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year. Unusually cool weather during the summer months may result in reduced demand for our products and have a negative effect on our business and financial performance.\nIn order to prepare for our peak selling season, we must produce and keep in stock more inventory than we would carry at other times of the year. Any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during our peak selling season could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown, which could reduce our net sales and gross profit.\nA deterioration of global economic conditions may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nDisruptions in the global credit and financial markets and in economic conditions generally may include diminished liquidity and credit availability, a decline in consumer confidence, a decline in economic growth, an increased unemployment rate and uncertainty about economic stability. Such disruptions may affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Any adverse global economic conditions and tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, manufacturers, distributors or customers could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions.\nOur sales growth is dependent upon maintaining our relationships with existing distributors and retailers and the loss of any one such distributor or retailer could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nCertain retailers that we service primarily through our distributors make up a significant percentage of our products\u2019 retail volume, including volume sold by our bottlers and distributors. We also sell directly to certain retail accounts and to the distribution facilities of such retailers. Some retailers also offer their own private label products that compete with some of our brands. For the year ended December 31, 2017, two customers, Garden Foods and Big Geyser accounted for 25% and 14% of our net sales, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, two customers, Seba Distribution LLC and Garden Foods accounted for 20% and 11% of our net sales, respectively. The loss of sales of any of our products in a major retailer could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nFood and beverage retailers in the U.S. have been consolidating which may reduce our ability to increase both our revenue and our gross margins.\nConsolidation has resulted in large, sophisticated retailers with increased buying power. They are in a better position to resist our price increases and demand lower prices. They also have leverage to require us to provide larger, more tailored promotional and product delivery programs. If we, and our bottlers and distributors, do not successfully provide appropriate marketing, product, packaging, pricing and service to these retailers, our product availability, sales and margins could suffer.\nWe do not have any contracts with our customers that require the purchase of a minimum amount of our products. The absence of such contracts could result in periods during which we must continue to pay costs and service indebtedness with reduced sales.\nOur customers do not provide us with firm, long-term or short-term volume purchase commitments. As a result of the absence of such contracts, we could have periods during which we have no or limited orders for our products, but we will continue to have to pay our costs, including those to maintain our work force and service our indebtedness with reduced sales. We cannot assure you that we will be able to timely find new customers to supplement periods where we experience no or limited purchase orders or that we can recover fixed costs as a result of experiencing reduced purchase orders. Periods of no or limited purchase orders for our products could have a material adverse effect on our net income and cause us to incur losses. Conversely, we may experience unanticipated increased orders for our products from these customers that can create supply chain problems and may result in orders we may be unable to meet. Unanticipated fluctuations in product requirements by our customers could result in fluctuations in our results from quarter to quarter.\nWe have developed a gallon product line in which our gross margins are minimal, and therefore may not generate sufficient revenues or other benefits to justify its introduction. In addition, the gallon product line may divert sales from our higher margin 18oz product line, which would adversely affect our business.\nIn May 2015, we developed a gallon product line featuring five of our existing flavors. Our gross margins on this product line are minimal. Accordingly, this product line may not generate sufficient revenues or other benefits to justify its introduction. In addition, to the extent distributors choose to carry the gallon product line instead of our higher margin 18oz product line, it may negatively affect our operating results, specifically our gross margin. Although we believe the gallon size has a different function and manner of consumption, consumers may choose to purchase the gallon size instead of the 18oz size, because the gallon size offers a better per ounce value. This would result in an overall lower gross margin for our business.\nWe do not have registered ownership of certain of our trade names and our intellectual property rights could be infringed or we could infringe the intellectual property rights of others, and adverse events regarding licensed intellectual property, including termination of distribution rights, could harm our business.\nWe possess intellectual property that is important to our business. This intellectual property includes our logo, trademarks for \u201cLong Island Iced Tea\u201d and \u201cThe Original Long Island Brand,\u201d various other trademarks, copyrights, patents, ingredient formulas, business processes and other trade secrets. However, we do not currently have registered ownership of the trademark \u201cThe Original Long Island Brand\u201d and do not have registered ownership on the principal register of the trademark \u201cLong Island Iced Tea\u201d as described below. We and third parties, including competitors, could come into conflict over intellectual property rights. Litigation could disrupt our business, divert management attention and cost a substantial amount to protect our rights or defend ourselves against claims. We cannot be certain that the steps we take to protect our rights will be sufficient or that others will not infringe or misappropriate our rights. Our business is also highly dependent upon our distribution rights. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, including the right to our trade name and logo, our brands, products and business could be harmed and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nOn April 19, 2016, the United States Patent and Trademark Officer, or the \u201cUSPTO,\u201d registered our mark \u201cLong Island Iced Tea\u201d (Registration No. 4,943,056) on the supplemental register. Registration on the supplemental register allows the use of the \u201c\u00ae\u201d symbol, blocks later filed applications for confusingly similar marks, and allows us to sue infringers in federal court, which has well-settled case law and standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the supplemental register does not provide all the protection of a registration on the principal register. As with any other registered mark, we may be open to claims of others contesting the trademark.\nIn addition, we have filed trademark applications for \u201cThe Original Long Island Brand\u201d as a standard character mark and as a stylized mark, which applications are pending review by the USPTO. The applications are for use of the trademarks with iced tea, tea based products, juices, water, beverages and other similar products. We also plan to file for stylized marks protecting certain other tag lines and product designs. With respect to the pending trademark applications for \u201cThe Original Long Island Brand\u201d (standard character mark and stylized mark), the USPTO has made an initial determination that both marks are geographically descriptive. This determination is refutable and the USPTO has afforded us the opportunity to produce evidence to establish that the marks have become distinctive of the goods in commerce. There can be no assurance that the USPTO will approve these applications.\nIf we incur substantial debt, it could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $742,113 of total indebtedness, consisting of auto and vending loans and a bridge financing agreement. The bridge financing agreement ($688,038) is to be repaid based upon 15% of our future receipts. In December 2017, we entered into a Loan and Option Agreement (the \u201cFacility\u201d) in which a borrowing facility of an aggregate of $2,000,000 was made available, with the option to increase this amount to $4,000,000 with the consent of the lender. In connection with the Facility, on December 22, 2017, we received an initial drawdown of $750,000. The Company paid a $100,000 facility fee upon execution. On December 26, 2017, the $750,000 initial drawdown and accrued interest was converted by the lender into 250,233 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. In January 2018, the Company drew an additional $1,250,000 under the Facility. While our existing level of debt is not substantial and we will pay interest that accrues on these obligations, we may incur significant indebtedness in the future, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service such debt as cash payments become due. If new debt and/or new credit sources are added to our existing debt and credit sources, the related risks for us could intensify.\nIf we incur substantial debt, it could have important consequences. In particular, it could:\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf limit, along with the restrictive covenants of our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds;\n\u25cf limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the industries in which we operate;\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nIn addition, if we are unable to make payments as they come due or comply with the restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, there could be a default under the terms of such agreements. In such event, or if we are otherwise in default under one or more of such agreements, including pursuant to any cross-default provisions of such agreements, the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend and/or accelerate the loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. Furthermore, they could foreclose on their security interests in our assets, including the equity interests in our material subsidiaries. If any of those events occur, our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to find alternative financing. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Failure to maintain existing or secure new financing could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position.\nThe loss of the services of our key personnel could negatively affect our business, as could our inability to attract and retain qualified management, sales and technical personnel as and when needed.\nThe execution of our business strategy depends largely on the continued efforts of Philip Thomas. On February 20, 2018, Mr. Thomas (co-founder of LIBB) resigned as our Chief Executive Officer. Under the direction of a special beverage committee of the Board, Mr. Thomas is expected to lead the beverage business until after the Spinoff. As we have a limited operating history, we are highly dependent upon this individuals\u2019 knowledge, experience and reputation within the industry. We cannot be assured of how long or under what conditions Mr. Thomas will continue to look after the beverage business. If Mr. Thomas were to stop looking after the beverage business, we may not be able to find adequate replacements for him. Without his experience, expertise and reputation, our development efforts and future prospects would be substantially impaired.\nWe may not comply with applicable government laws and regulations, and they could change. Any violations could result in reputational damage or substantial penalties, and any changes could result in increased compliance costs.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S., and other countries in which we do business. These laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business including the manufacture, safety, labeling, transportation, advertising and sale of our products. Violations of these laws or regulations could damage our reputation and/or result in regulatory actions with substantial penalties. In addition, any significant change in such laws or regulations or their interpretation, or the introduction of higher standards or more stringent laws or regulations could result in increased compliance costs or capital expenditures. For example, changes in recycling and bottle deposit laws or special taxes on soft drinks or ingredients could increase our costs. Regulatory focus on the health, safety and marketing of food products is increasing. Certain state warning and labeling laws, such as California\u2019s \u201cProp 65,\u201d which requires warnings on any product with substances that the state lists as potentially causing cancer or birth defects, could become applicable to our products. Some local and regional governments and school boards have enacted, or have proposed to enact, regulations restricting the sale of certain types of soft drinks in schools. Any violations or changes of regulations could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, or disrupt the production or distribution of our products, and negatively affect our business and financial performance.\nFurther growth into our \u2018better-for-you\u2019 brand portfolio may, in part, result from merger, acquisition, distribution or licensing agreements that require greater capability of management to effectively administer this growth and may have greater inherent risk.\nWe are constantly looking to grow our business through potential mergers, acquisitions, distribution agreements or licensing agreements. However, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates, obtain the capital necessary to pursue our strategy or have the agreements be on satisfactory terms. We will likely experience significant competition in our effort to execute a strategy as a number of competitors have also adopted a strategy of expanding and diversifying through acquisitions, mergers, distribution or licensing agreements. As a result, we may be unable to continue to further our growth strategy or may be forced to pay more for the growth than we would otherwise want to pay. When growth occurs, we may not be able to integrate or manage these businesses to produce returns that justify the investment. Any difficulty in successfully integrating or managing the operations of such growth could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and could lead to a failure to realize any anticipated synergies. Our management also will be required to dedicate substantial time and effort to the integration of any mergers, acquisitions, distribution or licensing agreements. These efforts could divert management\u2019s focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and operational matters.\nRisks Related to Our Businesses\nOur ability to grow and compete in the future will be adversely affected if adequate capital is not available to us or not available on terms favorable to us.\nHistorically, our cash generated from operations has not been sufficient to meet our expenses. We have financed our operations principally through the raising of equity capital, debt and through trade credit with our vendors. Our ability to continue our operations and to pay our obligations when they become due is contingent upon obtaining additional financing. If we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned market development activities, and/or consider reductions in personnel costs or other operating costs. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have a limited operating history and history of operating losses, and there is no guarantee that we will achieve profitability.\nWe have a limited operating history and a history of operating losses. There is no guarantee that we will become a profitable business. Further, our future operating results depend upon a number of factors, including our ability to manage our growth, retain our customer base and to successfully identify and respond to emerging trends in our market areas.\nRisks Related an Investment in Our Common Stock\nThe Spinoff may have negative consequences.\nAs indicated herein, our board of directors approved management\u2019s intentions to effectuate the Spinoff of LIBB. The Spinoff is intended to allow us to focus exclusively on our move into the Blockchain technology industry. However, the Spinoff may have negative consequences to it. For instance, the actions required to separate LIBB from our company could disrupt both company\u2019s operations. Further, we will incur costs in connection with the Spinoff that would not be incurred if LIBB were to continue as a subsidiary of ours.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date. Any future decisions regarding dividends will be made by our board of directors. We do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future, but expect to retain earnings to finance the growth of our business. Therefore, any return on investments will only occur if the market price of our common stock appreciates.\nA robust public market for our common stock may not develop or be sustained, which could affect your ability to sell our common stock or depress the market price of our common stock.\nEffective April 12, 2018, our common stock is traded and quoted on the Pink Current Information tier operated by the OTC. We are unable to predict whether an active trading market for our common stock will develop or will be sustained. Because our common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, we may be subject to the following significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\n\u25cf a determination that our shares of common stock are \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares of common stock;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe trading price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe price and volume of our common stock may be volatile and subject to fluctuations. Our stock has traded at a low of $1.70 to a high of $12.55 since January 1, 2016, and the current stock price is $1.96 as of April 9, 2018. Some of the factors that could cause fluctuations in the stock price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u25cf general market and economic conditions and market trends, including in the beverage industry and the financial markets generally;\n\u25cf the political, economic and social situation in the U.S.;\n\u25cf actual or expected variations in operating results;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, or other business developments;\n\u25cf adoption of new accounting standards affecting the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf operations and stock performance of competitors;\n\u25cf litigation or governmental action involving or affecting us or our subsidiaries;\n\u25cf recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf purchase or sales of blocks of our common stock; and\n\u25cf operating and stock performance of the companies that investors may consider to be comparable.\nThere can be no assurance that the price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly. The stock market in recent years has experienced considerable price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies and that could materially adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. You should also be aware that price volatility might be worse if the trading volume of shares of our common stock is low, as it historically has been.\nOur outstanding warrants and options will increase the number of shares outstanding and available for sale in the public markets, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe presently have outstanding (i) stock options to purchase 500,034 shares of common stock at exercise prices of between $3.23 and $5.00 per share held by certain of our executive officers, directors and employees and (ii) warrants to purchase up to 1,369,320 shares of common stock at exercise prices of between $2.40 and $6.875 per share. If and to the extent these warrants and options are exercised, you may experience dilution to your holdings and/or it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock also may be adversely affected, if and to the extent the shares registered for resale pursuant to this prospectus are sold in the public markets.\nThe substantial number of shares that are eligible for sale pursuant to our resale registration statement could cause the market price for our common stock to decline or make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future.\nWe have an effective registration statement registering the resale by certain of our stockholders of up to 4,348,889 shares of our common stock. Expectations that shares of our common stock may be sold by the selling stockholders could create an \u201coverhang\u201d that may adversely affect the market price for our common stock.\nWe cannot predict the effect on the market price of our common stock from time to time as a result of (i) sales by the stockholders of some or all of the 4,348,889 shares of our common stock under our resale registration statement, (ii) the availability of such shares of common stock for sale by the selling stockholders, or (iii) the perception that such shares may be offered for sale by the selling stockholders. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales will occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or make future offerings of our equity securities more difficult. Any sale, or perceived impending sale, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nWe have the ability to issue additional shares of common stock and \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could affect the rights of holders of the common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue 35,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to set the terms of such preferred stock. We have 19,243,900 authorized but unissued shares of common stock available for issuance after appropriate reservation for our outstanding options and warrants (excluding any warrants that may be issued to the investors in this offering). The issuance of additional common stock may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders. In addition, the terms of such preferred stock may materially adversely impact the dividend and liquidation rights of holders of the common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.\nOur charter contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together, these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nOur senior executive officers and directors may not be able to successfully manage a publicly traded company.\nNot all of our senior executive officers or directors have extensive experience managing a publicly traded company, and they may not be successful in doing so. The demands of managing a publicly traded company, like ours, is much greater as compared to those of a private company, and some of our senior executive officers and directors may not be able to successfully meet those increased demands.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies. These exemptions include not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Investors may find our common stock less attractive because we rely, or may rely, on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, the price of our common stock may be reduced, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile.\nIn addition, under the JOBS Act, \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d\nWe could remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until December 31, 2020, although a variety of circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier. For as long as we take advantage of the reduced reporting obligations, the information that we provide stockholders may be different from information provided by other public companies.\nObligations associated with being a public company require significant company resources and management attention, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the \u201cExchange Act,\u201d and the other rules and regulations of the SEC, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. These reporting and other obligations place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational and accounting resources, make certain activities more time-consuming and cause us to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In order to comply with these obligations, we may need to upgrade our systems or create new systems, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, expand or outsource our internal audit function, and hire additional accounting and finance staff. Because our resources are limited compared to many public companies, these requirement may impose a disproportionate financial burden on us. Furthermore, our limited management resources may exacerbate the difficulties in complying with these reporting and other requirements and prevent us from focusing on executing our business strategy. In addition, if we are unable to comply with the financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d we intend to continue to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d or \u201csmaller reporting companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and other scaled disclosure requirements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In general, we will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until December 31, 2020, although a variety of circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, and will remain a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d for each fiscal year where our public float remains below $75 million as of the last day of the second fiscal quarter of the prior fiscal year. We intend to take advantage of some or all of these exemptions and reduced reporting requirements until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and/or a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d at which time, we expect to incur significant additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with these additional requirements.", "PERMNO": 16175, "SIC": 2086, "TIC": "LBCC"}
