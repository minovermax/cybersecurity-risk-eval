{"cik": "1642081", "company": "Allegiance Bancshares, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s common stock involves risks. The following is a description of the material risks and uncertainties that the Company believes affect it business and an investment in the common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties that the Company is unaware of, or that it currently deems immaterial, also may become important factors that affect the Company and its business. If any of the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were to occur, the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In such an event, the value of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business\nThe Company\u2019s business concentration in Texas, specifically in the Houston metropolitan area, imposes risks and may magnify the consequences of any regional or local economic downturn affecting Houston, including any downturn in the energy or real estate sectors.\nThe Company conducts its operations almost exclusively in the Houston metropolitan area. As of December 31, 2015, the substantial majority of the loans in the Company\u2019s loan portfolio were made to borrowers who live and/or conduct business in Texas, and specifically, in the Houston metropolitan area, and the substantial majority of the Company\u2019s secured loans were secured by collateral located in the Houston metropolitan area. Accordingly, the Company is significantly exposed to risks associated with a lack of geographic diversification. The economic conditions in the Houston metropolitan area are dependent on the energy sector generally and the price of oil and gas specifically. Any downturn or adverse development in the energy sector or continued low oil or gas prices could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. Adverse economic developments, among other things, could negatively affect the volume of loan originations, increase the level of nonperforming assets and charge-offs, increase the rate of foreclosure losses on loans and reduce the value of the Company\u2019s loans and loan servicing portfolio. The decline in oil prices of nearly 50% during the six months from the end of June 2014 to the end of 2014 and an extended period of low oil prices following those declines through December 31, 2015 has, and is expected to continue to have, a significant negative impact on the overall Texas economy. Any regional or local economic downturn that affects the Houston metropolitan area or Texas more generally, or the Company\u2019s existing borrowers, prospective borrowers or property values in the Company\u2019s market area may affect the Company and its profitability more significantly and more adversely than those of the Company\u2019s competitors with operations that are less geographically concentrated in the same area.\nThe Company may not be able to implement aspects of its growth strategy, which may affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain its historical earnings trends.\nThe Company\u2019s growth strategy focuses on organic growth, supplemented by strategic acquisitions. The Company may not be able to execute on aspects of its growth strategy to sustain its historical rate of growth or may not be able to grow at all. More specifically, the Company may not be able to generate sufficient new loans and deposits within acceptable risk and expense tolerances, obtain the personnel or funding necessary for additional growth or find suitable acquisition candidates. Various factors, such as economic conditions, in particular, the current environment of low oil prices and competition, may impede or prohibit the growth of the Company\u2019s operations, the opening of new branches and the consummation of additional acquisitions. Further, the Company may be unable to attract and retain experienced bankers, which could adversely affect its growth. The success of the Company\u2019s growth strategy also depends on its ability to effectively manage growth, which is dependent upon a number of factors, including the Company\u2019s ability to adapt its existing credit, operational, technology and governance infrastructure to accommodate expanded operations. If the Company fails to implement one or more aspects of its growth strategy, the Company may be unable to maintain its historical earnings trends, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent on its executive officers and other key individuals to continue the implementation of the Company\u2019s long-term business strategy and the loss of one or more of these key individuals could curtail the Company\u2019s growth and adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s continued success is dependent upon the skills, experience and continued service of its executive management team and board of directors. The Company\u2019s goals, strategies and continued growth are closely tied to the strengths and banking philosophy of its executive management team, including the Company\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, George Martinez, and its President, Steven F. Retzloff. Successful implementation of the Company\u2019s business strategy is also dependent in part on the continued service of its branch presidents. The community involvement and diverse and extensive local business relationships and experience in the Houston market of the Company\u2019s officers in the Houston metropolitan area are important to its success. The loss of services of any of these key personnel in the future could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business because of their skills, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel who are experienced in the specialized aspects of the Company\u2019s business or who have ties to the communities within its market areas. Currently, it is generally the Company\u2019s policy not to have employment agreements with its officers. While the Company does not anticipate any changes in its executive management team, the unexpected loss of any of these members of management could have a material effect on the Company and its ability to implement the Company\u2019s business strategy.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to retain bankers and recruit additional successful bankers is critical to the success of its business strategy and any failure to do so could impair its customer relationships and adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to retain and grow its loans, deposits and fee income depends upon the business generation capabilities, reputation and the relationship management skills of the Company\u2019s lenders. If the Company were to lose the services of any of its bankers, including successful bankers employed by banks that the Company may acquire, to a new or existing competitor or otherwise, the Company may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of its customers could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of the Company\u2019s services.\nThe Company\u2019s success and growth strategy also depends on its continued ability to attract and retain experienced loan officers and support staff, as well as other management personnel. The Company may face difficulties in recruiting and retaining lenders and other personnel of the Company\u2019s desired caliber, including as a result of competition from other financial institutions. Competition for loan officers and other personnel is strong and the Company may not be successful in attracting or retaining the personnel it requires. In particular, many of the Company\u2019s competitors are significantly larger with greater financial resources, and may be able to offer more attractive compensation packages and broader career opportunities. Additionally, the Company may incur significant expenses and expend significant time and resources on training, integration and business development before it is able to determine whether a new loan officer will be profitable or effective. If the Company is unable to attract and retain successful loan officers and other personnel, or if its loan officers and other personnel fail to meet the Company\u2019s expectations in terms of customer relationships and profitability, the Company may be unable to execute its business strategy and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects may be negatively affected.\nA key piece of the Company\u2019s strategic growth plan involves decision-making authority at the branch and market level, and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be negatively affected if the Company\u2019s local teams do not follow the Company\u2019s internal policies or are negligent in their decision-making.\nThe Company attracts and retains its management talent by empowering them to make certain business decisions on a local level. Lending authorities are assigned to branch presidents and their banking teams based on their level of experience. Additionally, all loan relationships in excess of internal specified maximums are reviewed by the Bank\u2019s Executive Loan Committee, comprised of senior management of the Bank, or the Bank\u2019s board of directors, as the case may be. The Company\u2019s local lenders may not follow its internal procedures or otherwise act in the Company\u2019s best interests with respect to its decision-making. A failure of the Company\u2019s employees to follow the Company\u2019s internal policies, or actions taken by its employees that are negligent, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe Company\u2019s strategic growth plan, which includes pursuing acquisitions, could expose the Company to financial, execution and operational risks that could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe Company has acquired two financial institutions and intends to continue to pursue a strategy that includes future acquisitions. An acquisition strategy involves significant risks, including the following:\n\u2022 discovering proper candidates for acquisition;\n\u2022 incurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in management\u2019s attention being diverted from the operation of its existing business;\n\u2022 using inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management, compliance and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n\u2022 conducting adequate due diligence and managing known and unknown risks and uncertainties;\n\u2022 obtaining necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u2022 integrating the operations and personnel of the combined businesses, thereby creating an adverse short-term effect on results of operations;\n\u2022 attracting and retaining qualified management and key personnel, including lenders;\n\u2022 maintaining asset quality;\n\u2022 attracting and retaining customers;\n\u2022 attracting funding to support additional growth within acceptable risk tolerances; and\n\u2022 maintaining adequate regulatory capital.\nThe market for acquisition targets is highly competitive, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to find acquisition candidates that fit its strategy and standards. To the extent that the Company is unable to find suitable acquisition targets, an important component of its growth strategy may not be realized. Acquisitions of financial institutions involve operational risks and uncertainties, such as unknown or contingent liabilities with no available manner of recourse, exposure to unexpected problems such as asset quality, the retention of key employees and customers and other issues that could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business. Acquisitions of financial institutions are also subject to regulatory approvals that can result in delays, in some cases, for a lengthy period of time. The Company may not be able to complete future acquisitions or, if completed, the Company may not be able to successfully integrate the operations, technology platforms, management, products and services of the entities that it acquires or effectively eliminate redundancies. The integration process may also require significant time and attention from the Company\u2019s management that would otherwise be directed toward servicing existing business and developing new business. Further, acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and, therefore, some dilution of the Company\u2019s tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future acquisition, and the goodwill that the Company currently maintains or may recognize in connection with future transactions may be subject to impairment in future periods.\nChallenging market conditions and economic trends have adversely affected the banking industry and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is a business operating in the challenging and uncertain financial services environment. The success of the Company\u2019s business and operations is sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the U.S. and locally in the Company\u2019s industry and market. If the U.S. economy weakens and a lack of growth in population, income levels, deposits and business investment in the Company\u2019s local markets occurs, its growth and profitability from the Company\u2019s lending, deposit and asset management services could be constrained. Although economic conditions have improved in recent years, financial institutions continue to be affected by volatility in the real estate market in some parts of the country and uncertain regulatory and interest rate conditions. The Company has direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate market in Texas, particularly in the Houston metropolitan area, and could be affected by these events.\nUncertain market and economic conditions can make the Company\u2019s ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and estimate the losses in its loan portfolio more complex. Another national economic recession or continued deterioration of conditions in the Company\u2019s market could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in its allowance for loan losses and result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business:\n\u2022 loan delinquencies may rise;\n\u2022 nonperforming assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022 demand for the Company\u2019s products and services may decline; and\n\u2022 collateral securing the Company\u2019s loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could reduce customers\u2019 borrowing power and repayment ability.\nThe current environment of low oil prices could have an adverse impact on economic conditions in the U.S. generally and in the Houston metropolitan area specifically. Declines in real estate values, declines in the volume of home sales and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the current environment of low oil prices, including job losses, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s borrowers or their customers, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the goodwill that the Company has recorded in connection with a business acquisition becomes impaired, it could require charges to earnings, which would have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill represents the amount by which the cost of an acquisition exceeded the fair value of net assets the Company acquired in connection with the purchase of another financial institution. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if a triggering event occurs which indicates that the carrying value of the asset might be impaired.\nThe Company determines impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Any such adjustments are reflected in the Company\u2019s results of operations in the periods in which they become known. As of December 31, 2015, the Company\u2019s goodwill totaled $39.4 million. While the Company has not recorded any impairment charges since it initially recorded the goodwill, the Company\u2019s future evaluations of goodwill may result in findings of impairment and related write-downs, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe small to medium-sized businesses that the Company lends to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business developments, which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan, and such impairment could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company focuses its business development and marketing strategy primarily on small to medium-sized businesses, which the Company categorizes as commercial borrowing relationships of less than $5 million of exposure. The Company had loans totaling approximately $1.21 billion to small to medium-sized businesses, or 72.0%, of its total loans, as of December 31, 2015 and $749.6 million, or 74.8%, of the Company\u2019s total loans as of December 31, 2014. Small to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small and medium-sized business often depends on the management skills, talents and efforts of one or two people or a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loan. If general economic conditions negatively impact the Houston metropolitan area or Texas and small to medium-sized businesses are adversely affected, or the Company\u2019s borrowers are otherwise affected by adverse business developments, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.\nIf the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, the Company\u2019s earnings may be affected.\nThe allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred loan losses. The Company establishes its allowance for loan losses and maintains it at a level management considers adequate by management to absorb probable incurred loan losses in its loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses represents the Company\u2019s estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based upon relevant information available to us, such as past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions and other factors. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited back to the allowance. The Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses consists of a general component based upon probable incurred but unidentified losses in the portfolio and a specific component based on individual loans that are considered impaired. In determining the collectability of certain loans, management also considers the fair value of any underlying collateral. The amount ultimately realized may differ from the carrying value of these assets because of economic, operating or other conditions beyond the Company\u2019s control, and any such differences may be material.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses was $13.1 million, which represents 0.78% of its total loans and 252.66% of the Company\u2019s total nonperforming loans. As of December 31, 2014, the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses was $8.2 million, which represented 0.82% of its total loans and 258.98% of the Company\u2019s total nonperforming loans as of the same date. Additional loan losses will likely occur in the future and may occur at a rate greater than the Company has previously experienced. The Company may be required to take additional provisions for loan losses in the future to further supplement the allowance for loan losses, either due to management\u2019s decision to do so or as required by the Company\u2019s banking regulators. In addition, federal and state bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses and the value attributed to nonaccrual loans or to real estate acquired through foreclosure. Such regulatory agencies may require the Company to recognize future charge-offs. These adjustments may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe acquisition method of accounting requires that acquired loans are initially recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition, which includes an estimate of loan losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, and therefore no corresponding allowance for loan losses is recorded for these loans at acquisition because credit quality, among other elements, was considered in the determination of fair value. To the extent that the Company\u2019s estimates of fair value are too high, it will incur losses associated with the acquired loans.\nAs a significant percentage of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans, an adverse change in the economic conditions of the real estate market where the Company operates could affect real estate values and may result in losses to its business.\nAs of December 31, 2015, $1.21 billion, or 72.2%, of the Company\u2019s total loans (including loans held for sale) were comprised of loans with real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The real estate collateral provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value over the term of the loan, limiting the Company\u2019s ability to realize the full value of the collateral anticipated at the time of the originating loan. A weakening of the real estate market in the Company\u2019s primary market area could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, the value of real estate and other collateral securing the loans and the value of the Company\u2019s business. Collateral may have to be sold for less than the outstanding balance of the loan, which could result in losses on such loans. Such declines and losses in real estate values may cause the Company to experience increases in provisions for loan losses and charge-offs, which could adversely affect its profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s commercial real estate and construction, land development and other land loan portfolios expose it to credit risks that may be greater than the risks related to other types of loans.\nAs of December 31, 2015, $757.2 million, or 45.0%, of the Company\u2019s total loans (including loans held for sale) was comprised of commercial real estate loans (including owner-occupied commercial real estate loans) and $154.6 million, or 9.2%, of its total loans was comprised of construction, land development and other land loans. Commercial real estate loans generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Repayment of these loans is typically involve repayment dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. The availability of such income for repayment may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. These loans expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by other types of collateral because the collateral securing these loans is typically more difficult to liquidate due to the fluctuation of real estate values. Unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of the Company\u2019s commercial real estate loan portfolio could require it to increase the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses, which would reduce its profitability and may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReal estate construction, land development and other similar land loans involve risks attributable to the fact that loan funds are secured by a project under construction, and the project is of uncertain value prior to its completion. These risks include:\n\u2022 the viability of the contractor;\n\u2022 the value of the project being subject to successful completion;\n\u2022 the contractor\u2019s ability to complete the project, to meet deadlines and time schedules and to stay within the Company\u2019s estimates; and\n\u2022 concentration of such loans with a single contractor and its affiliates.\nReal estate construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan and also present risks of default in the event of declines in property values or volatility in the real estate market during the construction phase. If the Company is forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, it may be unable to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan. In addition, the Company may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA large portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial loans secured by receivables, inventory, equipment or other commercial collateral, the deterioration in value of which could increase the potential for future losses.\nAs of December 31, 2015, $396.2 million, or 23.6%, of the Company\u2019s total loans (including loans held for sale) was comprised of commercial and industrial loans to businesses that are typically based on the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay the loans from the cash flow of their businesses. These loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay each loan depends substantially on the success of the borrower\u2019s business itself and these loans are typically larger in amount, which creates the potential for larger losses on a single loan basis. Commercial and industrial loans are collateralized by general business assets including, among other things, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment and are generally backed by a personal guaranty of the borrower or principal. This collateral may decline in value more rapidly than the Company anticipates exposing it to increased credit risk. Significant adverse changes in the economy or local market conditions in which the Company\u2019s commercial lending customers operate could cause rapid declines in loan collectability and the values associated with general business assets resulting in inadequate collateral coverage that may expose the Company to credit losses and could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA lack of liquidity could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and jeopardize its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity is essential to the Company\u2019s business. The Company relies on its ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of the Company\u2019s loans and investment securities, respectively, to ensure that the Company has adequate liquidity to fund its operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of the Company\u2019s investment securities, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity. The Company\u2019s most important source of funds is deposits. Deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments such as money market funds, the Company would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing its funding costs and reducing the Company\u2019s net interest income and net income.\nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities and proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Company\u2019s equity and debt securities to investors. Additional liquidity is provided by the Company\u2019s ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the Federal Home Loan Bank (the \u201cFHLB\u201d) and the Company\u2019s ability to raise brokered deposits. The Company also may borrow funds from third-party lenders, such as other financial institutions. The Company\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize its activities, or on terms that are acceptable to the Company, could be impaired by factors that affect it directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. The Company\u2019s access to funding sources could also be affected by a decrease in the level of its business activity as a result of a downturn in the Houston metropolitan area economy or by one or more adverse regulatory actions against the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2015, $529.1 million, or 30.1%, of the Company\u2019s deposits consisted of interest-bearing demand deposits and money market and savings accounts. Based on the Company\u2019s experience, it believes that the Company\u2019s deposit accounts are relatively stable sources of funds. If the Company increases interest rates paid to retain deposits, its earnings may be adversely affected, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet its expenses, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying its borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Company fails to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to losses, an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, the Company\u2019s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as its ability to maintain regulatory compliance, could be adversely affected.\nThe Company, on a consolidated basis, and the Bank, on a stand-alone basis, must meet certain regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. Importantly, regulatory capital requirements could increase from current levels, which could require the Company to raise additional capital or reduce our operations. The Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital depends on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry, market conditions and governmental activities, and on the Company\u2019s financial condition and performance. Accordingly, the Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to the Company. If the Company fails to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, its liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nFluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact the Company\u2019s earnings and capital levels and overall results of operations.\nLike most financial institutions, the Company\u2019s earnings and cash flows depend to a great extent upon the level of its net interest income, or the difference between the interest income the Company earns on loans, investments and other interest-earning assets, and the interest expense the Company pays on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Therefore, any change in general market interest rates, such as a change in the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve or otherwise, can have a significant effect on the Company\u2019s net interest income. The majority of the Company\u2019s banking assets are monetary in nature and subject to risk from changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates can increase or decrease the Company\u2019s net interest income, because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income.\nAdditionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, adversely affect the demand for loans and the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans and decrease loan repayment rates. Conversely, a decrease in the general level of interest rates may affect the Company through, among other things, increased prepayments on its loan and mortgage backed securities portfolio and increased competition for deposits. Accordingly, changes in the general level of market interest rates may adversely affect the Company\u2019s net yield on interest-earning assets, loan origination volume, loan portfolio and the Company\u2019s overall results.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s asset-liability management strategy is designed to control and mitigate exposure to the risks related to changes in market interest rates, those rates are affected by many factors outside of the Company\u2019s control, including various governmental and regulatory monetary policies, inflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply, international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. Adverse changes in the Federal Reserve interest rate policies or other changes in monetary policies and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect the Company. The Company may not be able to accurately predict the likelihood, nature and magnitude of those changes or how and to what extent they may affect the Company\u2019s business. The Company also may not be able to adequately prepare for or compensate for the consequences of such changes. Any failure to predict and prepare for changes in interest rates or adjust for the consequences of these changes may adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings and capital levels and overall results.\nThe Company could recognize losses on securities held in its securities portfolio, particularly if interest rates increase or economic and market conditions deteriorate.\nThe Company invests in available for sale securities with the primary objectives of providing a source of liquidity, providing an appropriate return on funds invested, managing interest rate risk, meeting pledging requirements and meeting regulatory capital requirements. As of December 31, 2015, the amortized cost of the Company\u2019s securities portfolio was $162.0 million, which represented 7.8% of total assets. Factors beyond the Company\u2019s control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in its portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. For example, fixed-rate securities are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise. Additional factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual borrowers with respect to the underlying securities and continued instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause other-than-temporary impairment in future periods and result in realized losses. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary usually requires difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting interest rates, the financial condition of issuers of the securities and the performance of the underlying collateral, the Company may recognize realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods, which could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company faces strong competition to attract and retain customers from other companies that offer banking services, which could impact the Company\u2019s business by preventing it from obtaining customers and adversely affecting the Company\u2019s future growth and profitability.\nThe Company conducts its operations almost exclusively in the Houston metropolitan area. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors offer the same, or a wider variety of, banking services within this market area. These competitors include banks with nationwide operations, regional banks and other community banks. The Company also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings banks, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, asset-based non-bank lenders and certain other non-financial entities, such as retail stores that may maintain their own credit programs and certain governmental organizations that may offer more favorable financing or deposit terms than the Company can. In addition, a number of out-of-state financial intermediaries have opened production offices, or otherwise solicit deposits, in the Company\u2019s market area. Increased competition in the Company\u2019s market may result in reduced loans and deposits, as well as reduced net interest margin, fee income and profitability. Ultimately, the Company may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. If the Company is unable to attract and retain banking customers, it may be unable to continue to grow its loan and deposit portfolios, and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022 the ability to develop, maintain and build long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets;\n\u2022 the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022 the rate at which the Company introduces new products and services relative to its competitors;\n\u2022 customer satisfaction with the Company\u2019s level of service;\n\u2022 the ability to expand the Company\u2019s market position; and\n\u2022 industry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken the Company\u2019s competitive position, which could adversely affect its growth and profitability, which, in turn, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company also faces competition for acquisition opportunities in connection with the implementation of the Company\u2019s acquisition strategy. Because there are a limited number of acquisition opportunities in the Company\u2019s target market, it faces competition from other banks and financial institutions, many of which possess greater financial, human, technical and other resources than the Company does. The Company\u2019s ability to compete in acquiring target institutions will depend on the Company\u2019s available financial resources to fund the acquisitions, including the amount of cash and cash equivalents it has and the liquidity and market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. In addition, increased competition may also drive up the acquisition consideration that the Company will be required to pay in order to successfully capitalize on attractive acquisition opportunities.\nNegative public opinion regarding the Company or failure to maintain its reputation in the community that the Company serves could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and prevent it from growing the Company\u2019s business.\nAs a community bank, the Company\u2019s reputation within the community it serves is critical to the Company\u2019s success. The Company has set itself apart from its competitors by building strong personal and professional relationships with its customers and by its management and employees being active members of the communities the Company serves. As such, the Company strives to enhance its reputation by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share the Company\u2019s core values of being an integral part of the communities it serves and delivering superior service to its customers. If the Company\u2019s reputation is negatively affected by the actions of its employees or otherwise, the Company may be less successful in attracting new customers, and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Further, negative public opinion can expose the Company to litigation and regulatory action as the Company seeks to implement its growth strategy. While the Company actively works to minimize reputation risk in dealing with its customers, this risk will always be present given the nature of the Company\u2019s business.\nIf the Company fails to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, the Company may not be able to accurately report its financial results or prevent fraud.\nEnsuring that the Company has adequate disclosure controls and procedures, including internal controls over financial reporting, in place so that the Company can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is costly and time-consuming and needs to be re-evaluated frequently. The Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for evaluating and reporting on its system of internal control. The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statement for external purposes in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The Company is in the process of documenting, reviewing and, if appropriate, improving the Company\u2019s internal controls and procedures in anticipation of being subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting and, when the Company ceases to be an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, a report by the Company\u2019s independent auditors addressing its internal controls over financial reporting. The Company\u2019s management may conclude that its internal controls over financial reporting are not effective due to the Company\u2019s failure to cure any identified material weakness or otherwise. Moreover, even if the Company\u2019s management concludes that the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting are effective, the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm may not conclude that the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting are effective. In the course of their review, the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm may not be satisfied with the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting or the level at which its controls are documented, designed, operated or reviewed, or it may interpret the relevant requirements differently from the Company. In addition, during the course of the evaluation, documentation and testing of the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting, the Company may identify deficiencies that it may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the SEC for compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Any such deficiencies may also subject the Company to adverse regulatory consequences. If the Company fails to achieve and maintain the adequacy of its internal controls over financial reporting, as these standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, the Company may be unable to report its financial information on a timely basis, the Company may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that it has effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the Company may suffer adverse regulatory consequences or violations of listing standards. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nThe Company is subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\nThe Company is exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by employees and outsiders, clerical recordkeeping errors and transactional errors. The Company\u2019s business is dependent on its employees as well as third-party service providers to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions. The Company could be materially adversely affected if one of its employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates the Company\u2019s operations or systems or if one of its third-party service providers experiences an operational breakdown or failure. Employee errors and employee or customer misconduct could subject the Company to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm its reputation. Misconduct by the Company\u2019s employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from the Company, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of its customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions the Company takes to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject the Company to financial claims for negligence.\nThe Company maintains a system of internal controls to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud, as well as insurance coverage designed to protect the Company from material losses associated with these risks including losses resulting from any associated business interruption. However, if the Company\u2019s internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, when the Company originates loans, it relies upon information supplied by loan applicants and third parties, including the information contained in the loan application, property appraisal and title information, if applicable, and employment and income documentation provided by third parties. If any of this information is misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, the Company generally bears the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. Any of these occurrences could result in a diminished ability of the Company to operate its business, potential liability to customers, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company has a continuing need for technological change, and it may not have the resources to effectively implement new technology, or the Company may experience operational challenges when implementing new technology.\nThe financial services industry is changing rapidly, and to remain competitive, the Company must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of its products, services and technologies. In addition to better serving its customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. The Company\u2019s future success will depend, at least in part, upon its ability to respond to future technological changes and the ability to address the needs of its customers. The Company addresses the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in the Company\u2019s operations as it continues to grow and expand the Company\u2019s products and service offerings. The Company may experience operational challenges as it implements these new technology enhancements or products, which could result in the Company not fully realizing the anticipated benefits from such new technology or require the Company to incur significant costs to remedy any such challenges in a timely manner.\nThese changes may be more difficult or expensive than the Company anticipates. Many of the Company\u2019s larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior products to those that the Company will be able to provide, which would put the Company at a competitive disadvantage. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to its customers.\nThe Company\u2019s operations could be interrupted if its third-party service providers experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with banking regulations.\nThe Company depends on a number of relationships with third-party service providers. Specifically, the Company receives certain third-party services including, but not limited to, core systems processing, essential web hosting and other Internet systems, its online banking services, deposit processing and other processing services. If these third-party service providers experience difficulties, or terminate their services, and the Company is unable to replace them with other service providers, particularly on a timely basis, the Company\u2019s operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. Even if the Company were able to replace third-party service providers, it may be at a higher cost to the Company, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSystem failure or breaches of the Company\u2019s cyber security measures could subject the Company to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure the Company uses, including the systems and infrastructure of the Company\u2019s third-party service providers, could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. The Company\u2019s operations are dependent upon its ability to protect the Company\u2019s computer equipment, and the information stored therein, against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event, as well as from security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Any damage or failure that causes breakdowns or disruptions in the Company\u2019s general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems could damage its reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny, including enforcement action that could restrict the Company\u2019s operations, or expose it to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Computer break-ins, phishing and other disruptions could also jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through the Company\u2019s computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability and reputational harm to the Company and may cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us. In addition, advances in computer capabilities could result in a compromise or breach of the systems the Company and its third-party service providers use to encrypt and protect customer transaction data. A failure of such security measures could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may be subject to environmental liabilities and associated costs in connection with the foreclosure on real estate assets securing the Company loan portfolio, which could adversely affect it.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio is comprised of loans collateralized by real estate. There is a risk that hazardous or toxic waste could be discovered on the properties that secure the Company\u2019s loans. If the Company acquires such properties as a result of foreclosure, it could be held responsible for the cost of cleaning up or removing this waste, and this cost could exceed the value of the underlying properties and materially and adversely affect the Company. Although the Company has not historically and does not currently hold a material amount of real property in its loan portfolio that the Company believes presents a potential for such environmental risks, the Company does lend to borrowers in segments of the economy that may expose it to heightened environmental risk if the Company was forced to foreclose on a material amount of real property securing such loans.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Industry and Regulation\nThe Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be adversely affected by the highly regulated environment for bank holding companies and the laws and regulations that govern its operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles or changes in any of them.\nAs a bank holding company, the Company is subject to extensive examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies that govern almost all aspects of its operations. These laws and regulations are not intended to protect the Company\u2019s shareholders. Rather, these laws and regulations are intended to protect customers, depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund (the \u201cDIF\u201d) and the overall financial stability of the U.S. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which the Company can engage, limit the dividend or distributions that the Bank can pay to the Company, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee its debt and impose certain specific accounting requirements on the Company that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in its capital than generally accepted accounting principles would require. Compliance with these laws and regulations is difficult and costly, and changes to these laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. The Company\u2019s failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort to comply or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject the Company to restrictions on its business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, capital base and the price of its securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive.\nThe ongoing implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations.\nRecent economic conditions, particularly in the financial markets, have resulted in government regulatory agencies and political bodies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations thereunder affect both large and small financial institutions, including several provisions that will affect how community banks, thrifts and small bank and thrift holding companies will be regulated in the future. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law, and the process of implementation is ongoing. There remains significant uncertainty surrounding the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will ultimately be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and the full extent of the impact of the requirements on the Company\u2019s operations is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of the Company\u2019s business activities, require changes to certain of its business practices, require the development of new compliance infrastructure, impose upon the Company more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect its business. These changes may also require the Company to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements or with any future changes in laws or regulations may negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s management is reviewing the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, many of which are to be phased-in over the next several months and years, and assessing its probable impact on the Company\u2019s operations. However, the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry in general, and the Company in particular, is uncertain at this time.\nNew capital rules that were recently issued generally require insured depository institutions and their holding companies to hold more capital. The impact of the new rules on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operations is uncertain but could be materially adverse.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies to establish stricter risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits that apply to banks and savings and loan holding companies. In July 2013, the federal banking agencies published the final Basel III Capital Rules (as defined in \u201cRegulation and Supervision-Regulatory Capital Requirements and Capital Adequacy-US Implementation of Basel III\u201d) that revised their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets. The Basel III Capital Rules will apply to banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank. As a result of the enactment of the Basel III Capital Rules, the Company and the Bank will become subject to increased required capital levels. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective as applied to the Company and the Bank on January 1, 2015 with a phase-in period that generally extends through January 1, 2019.\nThe final rules increase capital requirements and generally include two new capital measurements that will affect the Company, a risk-based common equity Tier 1 ratio and a capital conservation buffer. Common Equity Tier 1 (\u201cCET1\u201d) capital is a subset of Tier 1 capital and is limited to common equity (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income and certain other items. Other instruments that have historically qualified for Tier 1 treatment, including non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, are consigned to a category known as Additional Tier 1 capital and must be phased out over a period of nine years beginning in 2014. The rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets (such as the Company) to continue to include trust preferred securities and non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 capital, but not CET1. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that have historically been placed in Tier 2, as well as cumulative perpetual preferred stock.\nThe final rules adjust all three categories of capital by requiring new deductions from and adjustments to capital that will result in more stringent capital requirements and may require changes in the ways the Company does business. Beginning January 1, 2015, the Company\u2019s minimum capital requirements are (1) a CET1 ratio of 4.5%, (2) a Tier 1 capital (CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) of 6.0% (up from 4.0%) and (3) a total capital ratio of 8% (the current requirement). The Company\u2019s leverage ratio requirement will remain at the 4.0% level now required. Beginning in 2016, a capital conservation buffer will phase in over three years, ultimately resulting in a requirement of 2.5% on top of the CET1, Tier 1 and total capital requirements, resulting in a required CET1 ratio of 7.0%, a Tier 1 ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. While the final rules will result in higher regulatory capital standards, it is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards will ultimately be applied to the Company.\nIn addition to the higher required capital ratios and the new deductions and adjustments, the final rules increase the risk weights for certain assets, meaning that the Company has to hold more capital against these assets. For example, commercial real estate loans that do not meet certain new underwriting requirements now must be risk-weighted at 150%, rather than the previous 100%. There are also new risk weights for unsettled transactions and derivatives. The Company also will be required to hold capital against short-term commitments that are not unconditionally cancelable; currently, there are no capital requirements for these off-balance sheet assets. All changes to the risk weights took effect in full in 2015. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital or additional capital conservation buffers, could result in management modifying the Company\u2019s business strategy and could limit its ability to make distributions, including paying dividends or buying back the Company\u2019s shares.\nState and federal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of the Company\u2019s business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and the Company\u2019s failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which it is or becomes subject as a result of such examinations may adversely affect the Company.\nTexas and federal banking agencies, including the TDB and the Federal Reserve, periodically conduct examinations of the Company\u2019s business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a Texas or federal banking agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of the Company\u2019s operations had become unsatisfactory, or that the Company, the Bank or the Company\u2019s respective management were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in the Company\u2019s and/or the Bank\u2019s capital, to restrict its growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against the Company, the Bank or the Company\u2019s respective officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance. If the Company becomes subject to such regulatory actions, its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reputation may be negatively impacted.\nThe Company may be unable to identify and consummate its new activities and expansion plans and successfully implement its growth strategy, which will require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them may restrict the Company\u2019s growth.\nThe Company intends to continue to grow its business through strategic acquisitions of financial institutions coupled with organic growth. Generally, the Company must receive state and federal regulatory approval before it can acquire an FDIC-insured depository institution or related business. In determining whether to approve a proposed acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, the Company\u2019s financial condition, liquidity, its future prospects and the impact of the proposal on U.S. financial stability. The regulators also review current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including the acquiring institution\u2019s record of compliance under the CRA) and the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities. Such regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to the Company, or at all, or may be granted only after lengthy delay. The Company may also be required to sell branches as a condition to receiving regulatory approval, which may not be acceptable to the Company or, if acceptable to the Company, may reduce the benefit of any acquisition.\nIn addition to the acquisition of existing financial institutions, as opportunities arise, the Company plans to continue de novo branching as a part of its organic growth strategy. De novo branching and any acquisitions carry with them numerous risks, including the inability to obtain all required regulatory approvals. The failure to obtain these regulatory approvals for potential future strategic acquisitions and de novo branches may impact the Company\u2019s business plans and restrict its growth.\nThe Company faces a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (\u201cU.S. Treasury\u201d) to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements, and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cDepartment of Justice\u201d), Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the sanctions programs and rules administered and enforced by the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control.\nThe Company provides banking services to customers located outside the United States, primarily in Guatemala. These banking services are primarily deposit accounts, including checking, money market and short term certificates of deposit. As of December 31, 2015, the Company\u2019s deposits from foreign nationals, primarily residents in Guatemala, accounted for less than 7.0% of its total deposits.\nIn order to comply with regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in this area, the Company has dedicated significant resources to its anti-money laundering program. If the Company\u2019s policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, the Company could be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on its ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of its business plans, including acquisitions and de novo branching. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nThe Company is subject to numerous federal and state lending laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material sanctions and penalties.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Justice and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion activity. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation.\nThe Company may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC deposit insurance assessments as a result of the FDIC\u2019s restoration plan, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s earnings.\nAs a result of economic conditions and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has increased the deposit insurance assessment rates and thus raised deposit premiums for insured depository institutions. If these increases are insufficient for the DIF to meet its funding requirements, further special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums may be required. The Company is generally unable to control the amount of premiums that it is required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional financial institution failures that affect the DIF, the Company may be required to pay FDIC premiums higher than current levels. The Company\u2019s regulatory assessments and FDIC insurance costs were $1.3 million compared with $848 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Any future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums may materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Federal Reserve may require the Company to commit capital resources to support the Bank.\nA bank holding company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and to commit resources to support its subsidiary banks. The Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. Under these requirements, in the future, the Company could be required to provide financial assistance to the Bank if it experiences financial distress.\nA capital injection may be required at times when Company resources are limited and the Company may be required to borrow the funds to make the required capital injection. In the event of a bank holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company\u2019s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of any note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may be materially and adversely affected by the soundness, creditworthiness and liquidity of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional customers. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or customer. In addition, the Company\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Company. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, the Company\u2019s earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the U.S. money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of both the discount rate and the federal funds rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Although the Company cannot determine the effects of such policies on it at this time, such policies could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could be volatile and may fluctuate significantly, which could cause the value of an investment in the Company\u2019s common stock to decline.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 general economic conditions and overall market fluctuations;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company\u2019s quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022 operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Company\u2019s;\n\u2022 the perception that investment in Texas is unattractive or less attractive during periods of low oil prices;\n\u2022 announcements by the Company or its competitors of significant acquisitions, dispositions, innovations or new programs and services;\n\u2022 the public reaction to the Company\u2019s press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022 changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts following the Company\u2019s stock, or the failure of securities analysts to cover the Company\u2019s common stock after this offering;\n\u2022 changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the Company\u2019s ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022 the trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock;\n\u2022 changes in governmental monetary policies, including the policies of the Federal Reserve;\n\u2022 changes in business, legal or regulatory conditions, or other developments affecting participants in the Company\u2019s industry, and publicity regarding the Company\u2019s business or any of its significant customers or competitors;\n\u2022 changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; and\n\u2022 future sales of the Company\u2019s common stock by the Company, directors, executives and significant shareholders.\nThe realization of any of the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock and cause the value of an investment in the Company\u2019s common stock to decline. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect investor confidence and could affect the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock over the short, medium or long term, regardless of the Company\u2019s actual performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, shareholders have often instituted securities class action litigation. If the Company were to be involved in a class action lawsuit, the Company could incur substantial costs and it could divert the attention of senior management and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention.\nAs a public company, the Company faces increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses that the Company did not incur as a private company, particularly after the Company is no longer an emerging growth company. As a public company, the Company is required to:\n\u2022 prepare and distribute periodic reports, proxy statements and other shareholder communications in compliance with the federal securities laws and rules;\n\u2022 expand the roles and duties of the Company\u2019s board of directors and committees thereof;\n\u2022 maintain an internal audit function;\n\u2022 institute more comprehensive financial reporting and disclosure compliance procedures;\n\u2022 involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the activities listed above;\n\u2022 enhance the Company\u2019s investor relations function;\n\u2022 establish new internal policies, including those relating to trading in the Company\u2019s securities and disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u2022 retain additional personnel;\n\u2022 comply with The NASDAQ Stock Market listing standards; and\n\u2022 comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nThe Company expects these rules and regulations and changes in laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, which have created uncertainty for public companies, to increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly relative to when the Company was not a public company. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. The Company\u2019s investment in compliance with existing and evolving regulatory requirements will result in increased administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. These increased costs may require the Company to divert a significant amount of money that it could otherwise use to expand the Company\u2019s business and achieve its strategic objectives.\nIf equity research industry analysts do not initiate or continue coverage on the Company\u2019s common stock or if they change their recommendations regarding the Company\u2019s stock if its operating results do not meet their expectations, the price and trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock could be affected by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about the Company or its business. The Company cannot predict whether any research analysts will cover the Company and its common stock nor does the Company have any control over these analysts. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the Company or fails to publish reports on it regularly, the Company could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the Company\u2019s stock price or trading volume to decline and the Company\u2019s common stock to be less liquid. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover the Company downgrade its stock or if the Company\u2019s operating results do not meet their expectations, either absolutely or relative to the Company\u2019s competitors, its stock price could quickly decline.\nFuture issuances of a substantial amount of the Company\u2019s common stock may depress the market price of shares of its common stock.\nSales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of its common stock and could limit the Company\u2019s future ability to raise capital through future sales or an offering of equity securities.\nThe Company may issue shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments and pursuant to compensation and incentive plans. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, or the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of other securities that the Company may issue may in turn be substantial. The Company may also grant registration rights covering those shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments.\nThe Company cannot predict the size of future issuances of its common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of its common stock will have on the market price of its common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s common stock (including shares of its common stock issued in connection with an acquisition or under a compensation or incentive plan), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for the Company\u2019s common stock and could impair its ability to raise capital through future sales of the Company\u2019s securities.\nThe Company may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire the Company or could otherwise adversely affect the rights of the holders of the Company\u2019s common stock, which could depress the price of its common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of formation authorizes it to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of one or more series of preferred stock. The Company\u2019s board of directors, in its sole discretion, has the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series, the designation of such series, and the dividend rate for each series, without any further vote or action by the Company\u2019s shareholders. The Company\u2019s preferred stock may be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of the Company\u2019s common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of the Company, discouraging bids for the Company\u2019s common stock at a premium over the market price, and materially adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company currently has no plans to pay dividends on its common stock, so holders of the Company\u2019s common stock may not receive funds without selling their common stock.\nThe Company has not paid dividends on its common stock in the past, and does not anticipate paying any dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock in the foreseeable future. The Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent on the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company, which is limited by applicable laws and banking regulations. Payments of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the Company\u2019s board of directors after taking into account various factors, including the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition, current and anticipated cash needs, plans for expansion and any legal or contractual limitations on its ability to pay dividends.\nThe Company is dependent upon the Bank for cash flow, and the Bank\u2019s ability to make cash distributions is restricted, which could impact the Company\u2019s ability to satisfy its obligations.\nThe Company\u2019s primary tangible asset is the Bank. As such, the Company depends upon the Bank for cash distributions (through dividends on the Bank\u2019s stock) that the Company uses to pay its operating expenses and satisfy its obligations (including debt obligations). There are numerous laws and banking regulations that limit the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, it will not be able to satisfy its obligations. These statutes and regulations require, among other things, that the Bank maintain certain levels of capital in order to pay a dividend. Further, federal and state banking authorities have the ability to restrict the Bank\u2019s payment of dividends through supervisory action.\nThe Company is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and it cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make its common stock less attractive to investors.\nThe Company is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. As such, the Company is eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions allow the Company, among other things;\n\u2022 to present only two years of audited financial statements and discuss the Company\u2019s results of operations for only two years in related Management\u2019s Discussions and Analyses;\n\u2022 not to provide an auditor attestation of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022 to choose not to comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the Company\u2019s audited financial statements;\n\u2022 to provide reduced disclosure regarding the Company\u2019s executive compensation arrangements pursuant to the rules applicable to smaller reporting companies, which means it does not have to include a compensation discussion and analysis and certain other disclosure regarding the Company\u2019s executive compensation; and\n\u2022 not to seek a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.\nIn addition, even if the Company complies with the greater disclosure obligations of public companies that are not emerging growth companies, the Company may avail itself of these reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future, so long as the Company is an emerging growth company. The Company will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, though it may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including if, before the end of such five years, the Company is deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC (which depends on, among other things, having a market value of common stock held by non-affiliates in excess of $700.0 million). Investors and securities analysts may find it more difficult to evaluate the Company\u2019s common stock because it may rely on one or more of these exemptions, and, as a result, investor confidence and the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s corporate governance documents and certain corporate and banking provisions of Texas law applicable to the Company could have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, make more difficult or prevent an attempted acquisition of the Company and other actions.\nThe Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of formation and bylaws contain certain provisions that may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change of control of the Company. These provisions include:\n\u2022 staggered terms for directors, who may be removed from office only for cause;\n\u2022 a provision establishing certain advance notice procedures for nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals; and\n\u2022 a provision that any special meeting of the Company\u2019s shareholders may be called only by a majority of the board of directors, the President or a holder or group of holders of at least 50% of the Company\u2019s shares entitled to vote at the meeting.\nThe Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of formation does not provide for cumulative voting for directors and authorizes the board of directors to issue shares of its preferred stock without shareholder approval and upon such terms as the board of directors may determine. The issuance of the Company\u2019s preferred stock, while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions, financings and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third-party from acquiring, a controlling interest in the Company. In addition, certain provisions of Texas law, including a provision that restricts certain business combinations between a Texas corporation and certain affiliated shareholders, may delay, discourage or prevent an attempted acquisition or change in control.\nIn addition, banking laws impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect \u201ccontrol\u201d of an FDIC-insured depository institution. These laws include the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act. These laws could delay or prevent an acquisition.\nFurthermore, the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of formation provides that the state and federal courts located in Harris County, Texas, the county in which the City of Houston lies, will be the exclusive forum for: (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on the Company\u2019s behalf; (b) any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; (c) any action asserting a claim against the Company arising pursuant to the Texas Business Organizations Code, the Company\u2019s certificate of formation, or the Company\u2019s bylaws; or (d) any action asserting a claim against the Company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Shareholders of the Company are deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of formation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of formation may limit the Company\u2019s shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in the Company\u2019s amended and restated certificate of formation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm the Company\u2019s business, operating results, and financial condition.\nShareholders may be deemed to be acting in concert or otherwise in control of the Company, which could impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements and result in adverse regulatory consequences for such holders.\nThe Company is a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve. Banking laws impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any shareholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect \u201ccontrol\u201d of an FDIC-insured depository institution or a company that controls an FDIC-insured depository institution, such as a bank holding company. These laws include the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act. The determination whether an investor \u201ccontrols\u201d a depository institution or holding company is based on all of the facts and circumstances surrounding the investment.\nAs a general matter, a party is deemed to control a depository institution or other company if the party (1) owns or controls 25.0% or more of any class of voting stock of the bank or other company, (2) controls the election of a majority of the directors of the bank or other company or (3) has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank or other company. In addition, subject to rebuttal, a party may be presumed to control a depository institution or other company if the investor owns or controls 10.0% or more of any class of voting stock. Ownership by affiliated parties, or parties acting in concert, is typically aggregated for these purposes. \u201cActing in concert\u201d generally means knowing participation in a joint activity or parallel action towards the common goal of acquiring control of a bank or a parent company, whether or not pursuant to an express agreement. The manner in which this definition is applied in individual circumstances can vary and cannot always be predicted with certainty. Any shareholder that is deemed to \u201ccontrol\u201d the Company for regulatory purposes would become subject to notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements and may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences. Potential investors are advised to consult with their legal counsel regarding the applicable regulations and requirements.\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s common stock is not an insured deposit and is not guaranteed by the FDIC, so investors could lose some or all of their investment.\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss or guaranteed by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. An investment in the Company\u2019s common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described herein. As a result, investors could lose some or all of their investment.", "PERMNO": 15774, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "ABTX"}
