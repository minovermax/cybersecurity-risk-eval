{"cik": "1043156", "company": "STAR BUFFET INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-08-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe restaurant industry is highly competitive.\nThe Company competes on the basis of the quality and value of food products offered, price, service, location, ambiance and overall dining experience. As the Company and its principal competitors expand operations in various geographic areas, competition can be expected to intensify. Such intensified competition could increase the Company\u2019s operating costs or adversely affect its revenues or operating margins. A number of the Company\u2019s competitors have been in existence longer than the Company and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources and wider geographical diversity than does the Company. In addition, the restaurant industry has few non-economic barriers to entry and is affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions and market trends. The Company\u2019s significant investment in, and long term commitment to, each of its restaurant sites limits its ability to respond quickly or effectively to changes in local competitive conditions or other changes that could affect the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe restaurant industry is complex and volatile.\nFood service businesses are often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends. The performance of individual restaurants may be adversely affected by factors such as traffic patterns, demographic considerations and the type, number and location of competing restaurants. Multi-unit food service businesses such as the Company\u2019s can also be materially and adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality, illness, injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one restaurant or a limited number of restaurants. The Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected by terrorist attacks directed toward the food supply chain or public concerns about the safety of the food supply chain. Dependence on frequent deliveries of fresh produce and groceries subjects food service businesses such as the Company\u2019s to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply, caused by adverse weather or other conditions, could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients. The Company\u2019s profitability is highly sensitive to increases in food, labor and other operating costs that cannot always be passed on to its guests in the form of higher prices or otherwise compensated for. In addition, unfavorable trends or developments concerning factors such as inflation, increased food, labor, employee benefits, including increases in hourly wage and unemployment tax rates utility and transportation costs, increases in the number and locations of competing restaurants, regional weather conditions and the availability of experienced management and hourly employees may also adversely affect the food service industry in general and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations in particular. Changes in economic conditions affecting the Company\u2019s guests could reduce traffic in some or all of the Company\u2019s restaurants or impose practical limits on pricing, either of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe restaurant industry is subject to substantial government regulation.\nThe restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws and regulations. The development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to building, zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements. We are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages. We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. We are subject to federal and state laws governing minimum wages, unionization and other labor issues. These include the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and requirements concerning overtime, paid or family leave, tip credits, working conditions and safety standards. They also include the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which requires among other things the preparation of Form I-9 to verify that employees are authorized to accept employment in the United States. We are also reviewing the potential impacts of new laws associated with health care passed by various state and local governments.\nWe also are subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the ADA. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings, and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation. New or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our labor costs.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials. There also has been increasing focus by United States governmental authorities on other environmental matters, such as climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating a yet to be specified array of environmental matters, such as the emission of greenhouse gases, where \u201ccap and trade\u201d initiatives could effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities, which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment.\nWe are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including credit card numbers), and health information. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly, and any failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws or any breach of our systems could harm our reputation or lead to litigation, which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or an insufficient or ineffective response to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our cost structure, operational efficiencies and talent availability, and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.\nOur inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThere has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants can post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. Information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, each of which may harm our performance, prospects, or business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. The dissemination of information online could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of the information's accuracy.\nMany of our competitors are expanding their use of social media and new social media platforms are rapidly being developed, potentially making more traditional social media platforms obsolete. As a result, we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal with guests and brand relevance. In addition, a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about us, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, or out-of-date information. The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.\nSecurities Risk Factors\nEffect of certain charter and bylaw provisions.\nCertain provisions of the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire, control of the Company. Such provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. The Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation allows the Company to issue up to 1,500,000 shares of currently undesignated preferred stock, to determine the powers, preferences, rights, qualifications and limitations or restrictions granted to or imposed on any un-issued series of that preferred stock, and to fix the number of shares constituting any such series and the designation of such series, without any vote or future action by the stockholders. The preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of the common stock. The Certificate of Incorporation also prohibits the ability of stockholders to call special meetings. The Company\u2019s Bylaws require advance notice to nominate a director or take certain other actions. Such provisions may make it more difficult for stockholders to take certain corporate actions and could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. In addition, the Company has not elected to be excluded from the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which imposes certain limitations on transactions between a corporation and \"interested\" stockholders, as defined in such provisions.\nPossible volatility of stock price.\nThe stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The volume of trading in the market for the Company's common stock is limited, which may make it difficult to liquidate an investment and can increase price volatility. Due to changes in the balance of buy and sell orders and other factors, the price of the Company's common stock can change for reasons unrelated to the performance of the business of the Company. Fluctuations in the Company's operating results, failure of such operating results to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors, changes in stock market\u2019s analyst recommendations regarding the Company, the success or perceived success of competitors of the Company, as well as changes in general economic or market conditions and changes in the restaurant industry may also have a significant adverse affect on the market price of the common stock.\nSale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause the market price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could substantially reduce the prevailing market price of our common stock. As of August 8, 2016, 3,213,075 shares of common stock were outstanding. The Company cannot predict the effect, if any, that sales of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock or the availability of such shares for sale will have on prevailing market prices. However, substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s common stock could be sold in the public market, which may adversely affect prevailing market prices for the common stock.\nControl by one principal stockholder.\nRobert E. Wheaton, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, currently beneficially owns approximately 45.3% of our total equity securities and possesses approximately 45.3% of the total voting power. Thus Mr. Robert E. Wheaton has the ability to control or significantly influence all matters requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the election of our directors. The control that Mr. Robert E. Wheaton has over Company matters may affect the willingness of certain investors to invest in the Company.", "PERMNO": 85402, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "STRZ"}
