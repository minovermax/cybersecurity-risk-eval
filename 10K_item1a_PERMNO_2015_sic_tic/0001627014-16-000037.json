{"cik": "1627014", "company": "Black Knight Financial Services, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nIn addition to the normal risks of business, we are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including those listed below and others described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the risks described herein could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, or if we are unable to provide adequate security in the electronic transmission of sensitive data, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to securely process, transmit and store electronic information. Security breaches of this infrastructure, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, consumer data and proprietary business information. Cyber-based attacks against financial institutions to extort payment in return for the release of sensitive information are increasing. Unauthorized access, including through use of fraudulent schemes such as \"phishing\" schemes, could jeopardize the security of information stored in our systems. In addition, malware or viruses could jeopardize the security of information stored or used in a user\u2019s computer. If we are unable to prevent such security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted, or we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss, lawsuits and other regulatory imposed restrictions and penalties because of lost or misappropriated information, including sensitive consumer data, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Likewise, our clients are increasingly imposing more stringent contractual obligations on us relating to our information security protections. If we are unable to maintain protections and processes at a level commensurate with that required by our large clients, it could negatively affect our relationships with those clients, increase our operating costs or subject us to liability under those contractual obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on our top clients for a significant portion of our revenues and profits, which makes us susceptible to the same macro-economic and regulatory factors that affect our clients. If these clients are negatively affected by current economic or regulatory conditions or otherwise experience financial hardship or stress, or if the terms of our relationships with these clients change, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a consolidated industry and as a result, a small number of our clients have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues. We expect that a limited number of our clients will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our largest client, Wells Fargo, N.A., or Wells Fargo, accounted for approximately 12% of our consolidated revenues and approximately 14% and 1% of the revenues from our Technology and Data and Analytics segments, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our five largest clients accounted for approximately 37% of our consolidated revenues, approximately 39% of our Technology segment revenues and approximately 29% of our Data and Analytics segment revenues.\nOur clients face continued pressure in the current economic and regulatory climate. Many of our relationships with these clients are long-standing and are important to our business and results of operations, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to retain or renew existing agreements or maintain our relationships on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, we rely on cross-selling our products and services to our existing clients as a source of growth. The deterioration in or termination of any of these relationships could significantly reduce our revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result, we may be disproportionately affected by declining revenues from, or loss of, a significant client. In addition, by virtue of their significant relationships with us, these clients may be able to exert pressure on us with respect to the pricing of our services.\nThe time and expense associated with switching from our competitors' software and services to ours may limit our growth.\nThe costs for a mortgage lender to switch providers of technology, data and analytics solutions and services can be significant and the process can sometimes take 12 to 18 months to complete. As a result, potential clients may decide that it is not worth the time and expense to begin using our solutions and services, even if we offer competitive and economic advantages. If we are\nunable to convince these clients to switch to our software and services, our ability to increase market share will be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe typically provide service level commitments under our client contracts. If we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services or face contract terminations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur client agreements typically provide service level commitments measured on a daily and monthly basis. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments or suffer extended periods of unavailability for our applications, we may be contractually obligated to provide these clients with service credits or refunds or we could face contract terminations. If we suffer unscheduled downtime that exceeds the allowed downtimes under our agreements with our clients or if we experience any extended service outages, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure to offer high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOnce our applications and technology are deployed, our clients depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues relating thereto. We may be unable to respond adequately to accommodate short-term increases in client demand for support services. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by our competitors. Increased client demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our applications and business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing clients. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to sell our applications to existing and prospective clients, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur clients and we are subject to various governmental regulations, and a failure to comply with governmental regulations or changes in these regulations could result in penalties, restrict or limit our or our clients' operations or make it more burdensome to conduct such operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our clients' and our businesses are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could restrict our ability to provide certain services or result in imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties, substantial regulatory and compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity and loss of revenues.\nAs a provider of electronic data processing to financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions, we are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the FFIEC. We also may be subject to possible review by state agencies that regulate banks in each state in which we conduct our electronic processing activities.\nIn addition, our businesses are subject to an increasing degree of compliance oversight by regulators and by our clients. Specifically, the CFPB has authority to write rules affecting the business of, supervise, conduct examinations of, and enforce compliance as to federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations with respect to certain \"non-depository covered persons\" determined by the CFPB to be \"larger participants\" that offer consumer financial products and services. The CFPB and the prudential financial institution regulators such as the OCC also have the authority to examine us in our role as a service provider to large financial institutions, although it is yet unclear how broadly they will apply this authority going forward. In addition, we believe some of our largest bank clients are subject to consent orders with the OCC and/or are parties to the National Mortgage Settlement, both of which require them to exercise greater oversight and perform more rigorous audits of their key vendors such as us.\nThe RESPA and related regulations generally prohibit the payment or receipt of fees or any other item of value for the referral of real estate-related settlement services. RESPA also prohibits fee shares or splits or unearned fees in connection with the provision of residential real estate settlement services, such as mortgage brokerage and real estate brokerage. Notwithstanding these prohibitions, RESPA permits payments for goods furnished or for services actually performed, so long as those payments bear a reasonable relationship to the market value of the goods or services provided. RESPA and related regulations may to some extent restrict our real estate-related businesses from entering into certain preferred alliance arrangements. The CFPB is responsible for enforcing RESPA.\nChanges to laws and regulations and enhanced regulatory oversight of our clients and us may compel us to increase our prices in certain situations or decrease our prices in other situations, may restrict our ability to implement price increases or otherwise limit the manner in which we conduct our business. We may also incur additional expense in keeping our technology services up to date as laws and regulations change, and we may not be able to pass those additional costs on to our clients. In addition, in response to increased regulatory oversight, participants in the mortgage lending industry may develop policies pursuant to which they limit the extent to which they can rely on any one vendor or service provider. If we are unable to adapt our products and services to conform to the new laws and regulations, or if these laws and regulations have a negative affect on our clients, we may\nexperience client losses or increased operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere may be consolidation in our end client market, which could reduce the use of our services by our clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsolidations among existing or potential clients could reduce the number of our clients and potential clients. If our clients merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our clients, or that use fewer of our services, they may discontinue or reduce their use of our services. In addition, if potential clients merge, our ability to increase our client base may be adversely affected and the ability of our customers to exert pressure on our pricing may increase. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory developments with respect to use of consumer data and public records could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our databases include certain public and non-public personal information concerning consumers, we are subject to government regulation and potential adverse publicity concerning our use of consumer data. We acquire, store, use and provide many types of consumer data and related services that are subject to regulation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Driver\u2019s Privacy Protection Act and, to a lesser extent, various other federal, state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are designed to protect the privacy of consumers and to prevent the unauthorized access and misuse of personal information in the marketplace. Our failure to comply with these laws, or any future laws or regulations of a similar nature, could result in substantial regulatory penalties, litigation expense and loss of revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, some of our data suppliers face similar regulatory requirements and, consequently, they may cease to be able to provide data to us or may substantially increase the fees they charge us for this data, which may make it financially burdensome or impossible for us to acquire data that is necessary to offer our products and services. Further, many consumer advocates, privacy advocates and government regulators believe that existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy or ensure the accuracy of consumer-related data. As a result, they are seeking further restrictions on the dissemination or commercial use of personal information to the public and private sectors as well as contemplating requirements relative to data accuracy and the ability of consumers to opt to have their personal data removed from databases such as ours. Any future laws, regulations or other restrictions limiting the dissemination or use of personal information may reduce the quality and availability of our solutions and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nParticipants in the mortgage industry are under intense scrutiny, and efforts by the government to reform the mortgage industry or address the troubled mortgage market and the current economic environment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSince the beginning of the housing crisis, the mortgage industry has been under intense scrutiny by governmental authorities, judges and the news media, among others. This scrutiny has included federal and state governmental review of all aspects of the mortgage lending business, and several actions to aid the housing market and the economy in general, and to implement more rigorous standards around mortgage servicing, with particular focus on loans that are in default.\nNew national servicing standards have been implemented that, among other things, require very specific loan modification procedures to be followed and offered to the borrower before any foreclosure proceeding can be implemented. These standards have further reduced the number of loans entering the foreclosure process and have negatively affected our default technology revenues and profit, and it is unclear what effect these standards will have on us in the future.\nAdditional state and federal government actions directed at housing and the mortgage industry are likely to occur and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur clients\u2019 relationships with GSEs are subject to change, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur clients have significant relationships with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are GSEs, tasked with working with financial institutions to provide liquidity to the mortgage market. They do this by purchasing loans from the lenders either for cash or in exchange for a mortgage-backed security that comprises those loans and that, for a fee, carries the GSEs guarantee of timely payment of interest and principal. Because our clients service the loans owned by GSEs, we provide solutions and services for many of those loans. As a result of these relationships, GSEs have been able to implement changes to our pricing structure on certain products and services we provide. GSEs or other governmental agencies may be able to exert similar pressure on the pricing of our solutions and services in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to adapt our solutions to technological changes or evolving industry standards, or if our ongoing efforts to upgrade our technology are not successful, we could lose clients and have difficulty attracting new clients for our solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe markets for our solutions are characterized by constant technological changes, frequent introductions of new products and services and evolving industry standards and regulations. Our future success will be significantly affected by our ability to successfully enhance our current solutions, and develop and introduce new solutions and services that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our clients and their customers. These initiatives carry the risks associated with any new product or service development effort, including cost overruns, delays in delivery and performance issues. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing, marketing and selling new solutions and services that meet these changing demands, that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction, and marketing of these solutions and services or that our new solutions and services and their enhancements will adequately meet the demands of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. If our efforts are unsuccessful, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor example, beginning October 3, 2015, the CFPB implemented new disclosure requirements for mortgage lending banks intended to help borrowers better understand key terms of mortgage loans and to make competing loan offers more comparable. We provide software and services to assist some of our clients in complying with these new disclosure rules. If our software and services prove to be inadequate in helping our clients comply with the new disclosure rules, our relationships with our customers, and our reputation in the mortgage servicing industry, may suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a competitive business environment and, if we are unable to compete effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe markets for our solutions are intensely competitive. Our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the services they offer. Some of our competitors have substantial resources. In addition, we expect that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures we face in the markets in which we operate will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, because many of our larger potential clients have historically developed their key processing applications in-house and therefore view their system requirements from a make-versus-buy perspective, we often compete against our potential clients\u2019 in-house capacities. As a result, gaining new clients in our mortgage processing business can be difficult. For banks and other potential clients, switching from an internally designed system to an outside vendor, or from one vendor of mortgage processing services to a new vendor, is a significant undertaking. These potential clients worry about potential disadvantages such as loss of custom functionality, increased costs and business disruption. As a result, these potential clients often resist change. There can be no assurance that our strategies for overcoming potential clients\u2019 reluctance to change will be successful, and if we are unsuccessful, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo the extent the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information increases, the demand for some of our data and information solutions may decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPublic sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become increasingly available recently, particularly through the Internet, and this trend is expected to continue. Governmental agencies in particular have increased the amount of information to which they provide free public access. Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information may reduce demand for, or the price that clients are willing to pay for, our data and information solutions. To the extent that clients choose not to obtain data and information from us and instead rely on information obtained at little or no cost from these public sources, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely upon proprietary technology and information rights, and if we are unable to protect our rights, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our intellectual property rights. We rely primarily on a combination of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademark laws and nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions on copying, distribution and creation of derivative products to protect our proprietary technology and information. This protection is limited, and our intellectual property could be used by others without our consent. In addition, patents may not be issued with respect to our pending or future patent applications, and our patents may not be upheld as valid or may not prevent the development of competitive products. Any infringement, disclosure, loss, invalidity of or failure to protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others.\nSuch litigation could be time-consuming, result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our applications or services are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others, we may be required to change our business practices and may also become subject to significant costs and monetary penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs our information technology applications and services develop, we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could:\n\u2022\nbe expensive and time-consuming to defend;\n\u2022\ncause us to cease providing solutions that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u2022\nrequire us to redesign our solutions, if feasible;\n\u2022\ndivert management\u2019s attention and resources; and\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies.\nAny one or more of the foregoing outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we may be liable for damages for past infringement if a court determines that our software or technologies infringe upon a third party\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights.\nIf we are unable to successfully consummate and integrate acquisitions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOne of our strategies to grow our business is to opportunistically acquire complementary businesses, technologies and services. This strategy will depend on our ability to find suitable acquisitions and finance them on acceptable terms. We may require additional debt or equity financing for future acquisitions, and doing so will be made more difficult by our substantial debt. Raising additional capital for acquisitions through debt financing could result in increased interest expense and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take certain actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional capital for acquisitions through equity financing, the ownership interests of existing shareholders will be diluted.\nIf we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates, we may experience slower growth. Further, even if we successfully complete acquisitions, we will face challenges in integrating any acquired business. These challenges include eliminating redundant operations, facilities and systems, coordinating management and personnel, retaining key employees, managing different corporate cultures and achieving cost reductions and cross-selling opportunities. Additionally, the acquisition and integration processes may disrupt our business and divert management attention and our resources. If we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses, products, technologies and personnel, it could impair relationships with employees, clients and strategic partners, distract management attention from our core businesses, result in control failures and otherwise disrupt our ongoing business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition. In addition, we may be required to record future charges for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from such acquisitions.\nOur profitability may be affected by gains or losses on any sales of businesses, or lost operating income or cash flows from such businesses. We also may be required to record asset impairment or restructuring charges related to divested businesses, or indemnify buyers for liabilities, which may reduce our profitability and cash flows. We may also be unable to negotiate such divestitures on terms acceptable to us. If we are unsuccessful in divesting such businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reliance on third parties subjects us to risk and may disrupt or adversely affect our operations. In addition, we may not realize the full benefit of our third-party arrangements, which may result in increased costs, or may adversely affect the service levels we are able to provide our clients.\nWe rely upon third parties for various business process and information technology services, including information security testing, telecommunications and software code development. Although we have contractual provisions with our providers that specify performance requirements, we do not ultimately control their performance, which may make our operations vulnerable to their performance failures. In addition, our failure to adequately monitor and regulate the performance of our third-party vendors could subject us to additional risk. Reliance on third parties also makes us vulnerable to changes in our vendors\u2019 businesses, financial condition and other matters outside of our control, including their violations of laws or regulations, which could increase our exposure to liability or otherwise increase the costs associated with the operation of our business. The failure of our providers to perform as expected or as contractually required could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations and to the services we provide to our clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our ability to access data from external sources to maintain and grow our businesses. If we are unable to access needed data from these sources or if the prices charged for these services increase, the quality, pricing and availability of our solutions may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely extensively upon data from a variety of external sources to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including data from third-party suppliers, various government and public record sources and data contributed by our clients. Our data sources could cease providing or reduce the availability of their data to us, increase the price we pay for their data or limit our use of their data for a variety of reasons, including legislatively-or judicially-imposed restrictions on use. If a number of suppliers are no longer able or are unwilling to provide us with certain data, or if our public record sources of data become unavailable or too expensive, we may need to find alternative sources. If we are unable to identify and contract with suitable alternative data suppliers and efficiently and effectively integrate these data sources into our service offerings, we could experience service disruptions, increased costs and reduced quality of our services. Moreover, some of our suppliers compete with us in certain product offerings, which may make us vulnerable to unpredictable price increases from them. Significant price increases could require us to seek substitute sources of data on more favorable economic terms, which may not be available at all. Loss of such access or the availability of data in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all may reduce the quality and availability of our services and solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur international third-party service providers and our own international operations subject us to additional risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOver the last few years, we have sought to reduce our costs by utilizing lower-cost labor outside the United States in countries such as India. These countries are subject to higher degrees of political and social instability than the United States and may lack the infrastructure to withstand political unrest or natural disasters. Such disruptions can affect our ability to deliver our solutions on a timely basis, if at all, and to a lesser extent can decrease efficiency and increase our costs. Weakness of the U.S. dollar in relation to the currencies used and higher inflation rates experienced in these countries may also reduce anticipated savings. Furthermore, the practice of utilizing labor based in foreign countries has come under increased scrutiny in the United States and, as a result, many of our clients may require us to use labor based in the United States. We may not be able to pass on the increased costs of higher-priced United States-based labor to our clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the foreign countries in which we have outsourcing arrangements or operate could adopt new legislation or regulations that could make it difficult, more costly or impossible for us to continue our foreign activities as currently being conducted. In addition, in many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") or other local anti-corruption laws. Any violations of FCPA or local anti-corruption laws by us or our subsidiaries, could result in substantial financial and other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have substantial investments in recorded goodwill as a result of the Acquisition, and an economic downturn or troubled mortgage market could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring write-downs that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nGoodwill recorded on our balance sheet was approximately $2.2 billion, or approximately 60% of our total assets, as of December 31, 2015. Current accounting rules require that goodwill be assessed for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. Factors that may indicate the carrying value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future results of operations, a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, and negative industry or economic trends. No goodwill impairment charge was recorded during 2015. However, if there is an economic downturn in the future, the carrying amount of our goodwill may no longer be recoverable, and we may be required to record an impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We will continue to monitor our market capitalization and the effect of the economy to determine if there is an impairment of goodwill in future periods.\nIf we fail to develop widespread brand awareness cost-effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to our ability to achieve widespread acceptance of our technology and attract new clients. Brand promotion activities may not generate client awareness or increase revenues, and even if they do, any increase in revenues may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses, we may fail to attract or retain clients necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, or to achieve the widespread brand awareness\nthat is critical for broad client adoption of our applications, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience system failures with respect to our technology solutions, damage or interruption that could harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability.\nWe depend heavily upon the computer systems and our existing technology infrastructure located in our data centers and certain systems interruptions or events beyond our control could interrupt or terminate the delivery of our solutions and services to our clients and may interfere with our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide necessary data to us and our employees\u2019 ability to attend to work and perform their responsibilities.\nThese potential interruptions include, but are not limited to, damage or interruption from hurricanes, floods, fires, power losses, telecommunications outages, terrorist attacks, acts of war, human errors and similar events. Our U.S. corporate offices and primary data center are located in Jacksonville, Florida, which is an area that is at high risk of hurricane and flood damage. In addition, acts of terrorism, which may be targeted at metropolitan areas that have higher population density than rural areas, could cause disruptions in our business or the economy as a whole. The servers that we use through various third-party service providers may also be vulnerable to similar disruptions, which could lead to interruptions, delays and loss of critical data. Such service providers may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in certain circumstances, and our insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur.\nDefects in our technology solutions, errors or delays in the processing of electronic transactions, or other difficulties could result in:\n\u2022\ninterruption of business operations;\n\u2022\ndelay in market acceptance;\n\u2022\nus, or our clients, missing a regulatory deadline;\n\u2022\nadditional development and remediation costs;\n\u2022\ndiversion of technical and other resources;\n\u2022\nloss of clients;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity; or\n\u2022\nexposure to liability claims.\nAny one or more of the foregoing occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we attempt to limit our potential liability through disclaimers and limitation-of-liability provisions in our license and client agreements, we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful in limiting our liability.\nWe may experience delays or difficulty in developing or implementing new or enhanced software or hosting solutions, which may negatively affect our relationships with existing and potential clients, reduce or delay the generation of revenues or increase development and implementation costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future financial performance depends upon the successful development, implementation and client acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our software and hosting solutions. We continually seek to develop enhancements to our solutions, including updates in response to changes in applicable laws, as well as new offerings to supplement our existing solutions. As a result, we are subject to the risks inherent in the development and integration of new technologies, including defects or undetected errors in our technology solutions, difficulties in installing or integrating our technologies on platforms used by our clients, or other unanticipated performance, stability and compatibility problems. Any of these problems could result in material delays in the introduction or acceptance of our solutions, increased costs, decreased client satisfaction, breach of contract claims, harm to our industry reputation and reduced or delayed revenues. If we are unable to deliver new solutions or upgrades or other enhancements to our existing solutions on a timely and cost-effective basis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our revenues from clients in the mortgage lending industry are affected by the strength of the economy and the housing market generally, including the volume of real estate transactions, a change in any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenues are primarily generated from technology, data and analytics we provide to the mortgage industry and, as a result, a weak economy or housing market may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The volume of mortgage origination and residential real estate transactions is highly variable and reductions in these transaction volumes could have a direct effect on the revenues we generate from our technology business and some of our data and analytics businesses.\nThe revenues we generate from our servicing technology depend upon the total number of mortgage loans processed on our MSP platform, which tends to be comparatively consistent regardless of economic conditions. However, in the event that a difficult\neconomy or other factors lead to a decline in levels of home ownership and a reduction in the number of mortgage loans outstanding and we are not able to counter the effect of those events with increased market share or higher fees, our mortgage processing revenues could be adversely affected. Moreover, negative economic conditions, including increased unemployment or interest rates or a downturn in other general economic factors, among other things, could adversely affect the performance and financial condition of some of our clients in many of our businesses, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations if these clients go bankrupt or otherwise exit certain businesses.\nA weaker economy and housing market tend to increase the volume of consumer mortgage defaults, which can increase revenues from our applications focused on supporting default management functions. However, government regulation of the mortgage industry in general, and the default and foreclosure process in particular, has greatly slowed the processing of defaulted mortgages in recent years and has changed the way many of our clients address mortgage loans in default. A downturn in the origination market and a concurrent slowdown or change in the way mortgage loans in default are addressed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have substantial indebtedness, which could have a negative effect on our financing options and liquidity position.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $1.7 billion of total debt outstanding.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including:\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business, which may cause us to have difficulty borrowing money in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes and may limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities and implement certain business strategies;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to use a large portion of the money we earn to pay principal and interest on our debt, which could reduce the amount of money available to finance operations, acquisitions and other business activities;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as $1.3 billion in principal amount of our debt bears interest at a floating rate as of December 31, 2015 (an increase of one percentage point in the applicable interest rate could cause an increase in interest expense of approximately $11.5 million on an annual basis based on the principal outstanding as of December 31, 2015, which may make it more difficult for us to service our debt);\n\u2022\nexposing us to costs and risks associated with agreements limiting our exposure to higher interest rates that we may enter into in the future, as such agreements may not offer complete protection from these risks, and we are subject to the risk that one or more of the counterparties to these agreements may fail to satisfy their obligations under such agreements; and\n\u2022\ncausing a competitive disadvantage if we have higher levels of debt than our competitors by reducing our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions, including increased competition.\nRisks associated with our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDespite our indebtedness level, we still may be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the indenture governing the Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement governing the Facilities impose operating and financial restrictions on our activities, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our outstanding debt levels, the risks related to our indebtedness that we will face could increase.\nCertain of our financing arrangements subject us to various restrictions that could limit our operating flexibility.\nThe indenture governing the Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement governing the Facilities impose operating and financial restrictions on our activities, and future debt instruments may as well. These restrictions include compliance with, or maintenance of, certain financial tests and ratios, including a minimum interest coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio, and limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\ncreate, incur or assume any additional debt and issue preferred stock;\n\u2022\ncreate, incur or assume certain liens;\n\u2022\nredeem and/or prepay certain subordinated debt we might issue in the future;\n\u2022\npay dividends on our stock or repurchase stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nenter into or permit to exit contractual limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us;\n\u2022\nenter new lines of business;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nengage in specified sales of assets; and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates.\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business could limit our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition and other corporate opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our outstanding debt instruments, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and results of operations, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of our outstanding debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may prove inadequate for the risks we face, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our risk management strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated. If our solutions change and as the markets in which we operate evolve, our risk management strategies may not always adapt to such changes. Some of our methods of managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior and management\u2019s judgment. Other of our methods of managing risk depend on the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers, catastrophe occurrence or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us. This information may not always be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. As a result, these methods may not predict future risk exposures, which could be significantly greater than the historical measures or available information indicate. In addition, management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record and verify large numbers of transactions and events, which may not be fully effective. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the timing of such outcomes. If our risk management efforts are ineffective, we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we could be subject to litigation, particularly from our clients, and sanctions or fines from regulators.\nCertain members of our Board of Directors and certain of our officers and directors have interests and positions that could present potential conflicts.\nWe are party to a variety of related party agreements and relationships with FNF, certain of FNF\u2019s subsidiaries and THL. Certain of our executive officers are employed by FNF or FNF\u2019s subsidiaries and certain of our directors serve on the boards of directors of FNF or its subsidiaries or are affiliated with THL. As a result of the foregoing, there may be circumstances where certain of our executive officers and directors may be subject to conflicts of interest with respect to, among other things: (i) our ongoing relationships with FNF, FNF\u2019s subsidiaries or THL, including related party agreements and other arrangements with respect to the administration of tax matters, employee benefits and indemnification; (ii) the quality, pricing and other terms associated with services that we provide to FNF or its subsidiaries, or that they provide to us, under related party agreements; (iii) business opportunities arising for any of us, FNF, FNF\u2019s subsidiaries or THL; and (iv) conflicts of time with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us.\nWe have in place a code of business conduct and ethics prescribing procedures for managing conflicts of interest and our chief compliance officer and audit committee are responsible for the review, approval, or ratification of any potential conflicts of interest transactions. Additionally, we expect that interested directors will abstain from decisions with respect to conflicts of interest as a matter of practice. However, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective or that we will be able to resolve all potential conflicts, or that the resolution of any such conflicts will be no less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated third party.\nOur senior leadership team is critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of the members of our senior leadership team. These personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace. We have attempted to mitigate this risk by entering into long-term (two to three year) employment contracts with the members of our senior management operating team. If we lose key members of our senior management operating team, we may not be able to effectively manage our current\noperations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may fail to attract and retain enough qualified employees to support our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our clients.\nOur business relies on large numbers of skilled employees and our success depends on our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees. If our attrition rate increases, our operating efficiency and productivity may decrease. We compete for employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work. If our business continues to grow, the number of people we will need to hire will increase. We will also need to increase our hiring if we are not able to maintain our attrition rate through our current recruiting and retention policies. Increased competition for employees could have a material adverse effect on our ability to expand our business and service our clients, as well as cause us to incur greater personnel expenses and training costs.\nWe may not be able to effectively achieve our growth strategies, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur growth strategies depend in part on maintaining our competitive advantage with current solutions in new and existing markets, as well as our ability to develop new technologies and solutions to serve such markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in new markets or continue to compete effectively in our existing markets. If we fail to introduce new technologies or solutions effectively or on a timely basis, or if we are not successful in introducing or obtaining regulatory or market acceptance for new solutions, we may lose market share and our results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nCurrent and future litigation, investigations or other actions against us could be costly and time consuming to defend.\nWe are from time to time subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our clients in connection with commercial disputes and employment claims made by our current or former employees. Litigation can result in substantial costs and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which may seriously harm our business, overall financial condition and operating results.\nFor instance, as described in Note 15 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of LPS, titled \u201cCommitments and Contingencies,\u201d attached hereto as exhibit 99.1, we have, in the past, incurred substantial costs associated with the settlement of a number of inquiries made by governmental agencies and claims made by several litigants concerning various current and past business practices of primarily LPS\u2019s default operations, which since January 2014 have been owned by another FNF subsidiary, ServiceLink. Also, as described in Note 11 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have recorded expenses relating to a proceeding filed by Merion Capital L.P. and Merion Capital II L.P., together referred to herein as Merion Capital, in connection with the Acquisition seeking a judicial determination of the \u201cfair value\u201d of Merion Capital\u2019s shares of LPS common stock under Delaware law, together with statutory interest. On September 18, 2014, we reached an agreement with Merion Capital to resolve an interest motion and FNF paid Merion Capital the merger consideration and we paid interest of $9.0 million through the date of payment. As of the date of this filing, the appraisal proceeding is ongoing. Also, BKIS has been named as a defendant in several lawsuits and investigations filed against the former LPS, even though the businesses associated with these cases have been contributed to ServiceLink.\nIn addition, in April 2011, the former LPS, now BKIS, and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a consent order, or the Consent Order, with several banking agencies in relation to its default operations, which are now part of ServiceLink. As part of the Consent Order, LPS agreed to further study the issues identified in a review by several banking agencies and to enhance its compliance, internal audit, risk management and board oversight plans, among additional agreed undertakings. In January 2013, LPS entered into settlement agreements with 49 states and the District of Columbia relating to certain practices within its default operations. In December 2015, the banking agencies notified ServiceLink that they wished to discuss terminating the Consent Order through a possible civil monetary penalty amount. ServiceLink and the banking agencies have entered into a tolling agreement to allow them to engage in these discussions, although they have not agreed on a possible civil monetary penalty. While the businesses underlying the subject matter of the Consent Order have been transferred to ServiceLink in connection with the Internal Reorganization and while we have entered into an indemnification agreement with ServiceLink that indemnifies us from claims relating to civil money penalties sought by the banking agencies relating to the Consent Order, there can be no guarantee that the banking agencies will not seek civil monetary penalties from us in the future or that we will be forestalled from making payments related thereto.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our accrual for legal and regulatory matters that are probable and estimable is $8.0 million, and includes costs associated with recently settled matters, as well as estimated costs of settlement, damages and associated legal fees applicable to certain pending litigation and regulatory matters, and assumes no third-party recoveries. Although certain other matters are subject to a cross-indemnity agreement between BKFS LLC and ServiceLink, there can be no assurance that we will\nnot incur additional material costs and expenses in connection with ongoing or future investigations or claims, including but not limited to fines or penalties and legal costs, or be subject to other remedies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Insurance may not cover such investigations and claims, may not be sufficient for one or more such investigations and claims and may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. An investigation or claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, management distraction or reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and adversely affect the trading price of our stock.\nRisks Related to Our Structure\nWe are a holding company and our only material asset is our interest in BKFS LLC and, accordingly, we are dependent upon distributions from BKFS LLC to pay taxes and other expenses.\nWe are a holding company and we have no material assets other than our ownership of Units of BKFS LLC. We have no independent means of generating revenues. Based on current accounting guidance, we have determined that BKFS LLC is a variable interest entity, or VIE, for accounting purposes and that we have a controlling interest in the VIE. As a result, our results of operations and financial condition are reported on a consolidated basis with BKFS LLC. In the event of a change in the accounting guidance or amendments to BKFS LLC\u2019s operating agreement resulting in us no longer having a controlling interest in BKFS LLC, we may not be able to consolidate BKFS LLC, which could have a material effect on our reported financial condition and results of operations.\nBKFS LLC is treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes and, as such, is itself not subject to United States federal income tax. Instead, its taxable income is generally allocated to its members, including us. Accordingly, we incur income taxes on any taxable income of BKFS LLC that is allocated to us and also incur expenses related to our operations. Subject to the availability of net cash flow at the BKFS LLC level and to applicable legal and contractual restrictions, we intend to cause BKFS LLC to distribute cash to its members, including us, to cover their respective tax liabilities, if any, with respect to their allocable share of the income of BKFS LLC and to cover any other costs or expenses of Black Knight, including any dividends.\nWe have entered into an advancement agreement with BKFS LLC pursuant to which BKFS LLC advances the cost of (or pays on behalf of Black Knight) expenses incurred by Black Knight, including fees and expenses incurred in any equity offering by Black Knight or selling shareholders, customary costs and expenses associated with being a public company, including costs of professional advisors engaged by Black Knight or its Board of Directors, indemnification obligations of Black Knight, directors fees and certain taxes. To the extent that we need funds to pay our liabilities or to fund our operations, and BKFS LLC is restricted from making distributions to us under applicable agreements, laws or regulations or does not have sufficient cash to make these distributions, we may have to borrow funds to meet these obligations and operate our business, and our liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIn certain circumstances, items of taxable income, gain, deduction or loss may not be allocated by BKFS LLC for income tax purposes to its members in proportion to the number of Units owned by each member and we may not receive our proportionate share of tax distributions from BKFS LLC.\nBKFS LLC is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and, as such, is itself not subject to income tax. Instead, the taxable income of BKFS LLC is allocated to its members, including us, and the members are required to reflect on their own income tax returns the items of income, gain, deduction and loss and other tax items of BKFS LLC that are allocated to them. Under the LLC Agreement and subject to restrictions under any financing arrangements, BKFS LLC is required to make tax distributions to its members in order to enable them to pay taxes on their allocable share of BKFS LLC\u2019s taxable income. Under the LLC Agreement, the right to receive tax distributions is independent from the right to receive ordinary distributions from BKFS LLC, and any tax distributions received by a holder of Units are taken into account in determining the portion of any ordinary distributions that the holder is entitled to receive.\nUnder the tax rules, BKFS LLC is required to allocate net taxable income disproportionately to its members in certain circumstances. Accordingly, certain items of deduction are not allocated pro rata among the holders of Units, and we and certain THL Affiliates may be allocated, on a net basis, a disproportionately greater percentage of certain items of deduction relative to BKHI and certain of its affiliates. As a result, we may receive less than our proportionate share of tax distributions relative to BKHI and certain of its affiliates. Moreover, any disproportionately greater tax distributions received by BKHI and certain of its affiliates will itself require an additional allocation of income to BKHI and certain of its affiliates to reflect such entitlement to the greater amount of tax distributions, which in turn could require an even greater tax distribution to BKHI and certain of its affiliates in respect of such additional allocation of income.\nBKFS LLC may be required to make tax distributions to holders of Units in amounts in excess of the tax expense that BKFS LLC would incur if it were a similarly situated corporate taxpayer.\nTax distributions are generally made based on an assumed tax rate equal to the highest combined marginal federal, state and local income tax rate applicable to a U.S. corporation, which may be higher than the combined tax rate that would be applicable\nto BKFS LLC if it were a similarly situated corporate taxpayer. Thus, after taking into account required tax distributions, BKFS LLC may have less funds available to reinvest in its business and to fund future growth than it would have had if BKFS LLC were a similarly situated corporate taxpayer. In addition, under the LLC Agreement, tax distributions are calculated based on allocations of income for a particular taxable year without taking into account any losses allocated to the holder in a prior taxable year. However, if BKFS LLC were a similarly situated corporate taxpayer, it would generally be entitled to offset taxable income earned in one year with losses incurred in a prior year, thereby reducing its income tax expense. Further, as discussed above, certain items of deduction may be allocated disproportionately among the holders of Units, us and certain THL Affiliates in particular. As a result, it is possible that even if BKFS LLC incurs an overall loss for a particular taxable year, BKHI and certain of its affiliates may be allocated net earnings (as a result of an allocation of fewer deductions that does not fully offset its proportionate share of gross earnings allocations) while we and certain THL Affiliates will be allocated a greater amount of loss than the overall loss incurred by BKFS LLC. In such circumstance, BKFS LLC may be required to make a tax distribution to BKHI and certain of its affiliates even though it would have had an overall loss, and therefore no tax expense, had it been a similarly situated corporate taxpayer.\nIf we do not elect to issue shares of Class A common stock for future exchanges of Units in lieu of BKFS LLC making cash payments, such cash payments may reduce the amount of overall cash flow that would otherwise be available to us.\nEach outstanding Unit, together with one share of our Class B common stock, is exchangeable for a cash payment from BKFS LLC, or, at our option, one share of Class A common stock, as described under in the LLC Agreement. If BKFS LLC makes cash payments in respect of exchanges of Units, such payments may require the payment of significant amounts of cash and may reduce the amount of overall cash flow that could otherwise be available for distribution to us from BKFS LLC, and our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy may be negatively affected.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NYSE rules, and as a result, we qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nFNF, through BKHI and certain of its affiliates, controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock and a controlling interest in us as a result of its ownership of Class B common stock. As a result, we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance rules of the NYSE. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power in the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that (i) a majority of the Board of Directors consist of independent directors and (ii) that the Board of Directors have compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees composed entirely of independent directors.\nWe utilize the independence exception provided for our compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees. As a result, we do not have a compensation or nominating and corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors. In addition, one-half of our Board of Directors is currently composed of independent directors, and we are not required to have a Board of Directors that is composed of a majority of independent directors at any time in the future so long as we are still a \"controlled company\". Accordingly, you will not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements set by the NYSE. In the event that we cease to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and our shares continue to be listed on the NYSE, we will be required to comply with these provisions within the applicable transition periods. These exemptions do not modify the independence requirements for our audit committee, and we intend to comply with the applicable requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and the NYSE with respect to our audit committee within the applicable time frame following our IPO, which is one year from the effective date of our registration statement, or May 19, 2016.\nWe are controlled by FNF, whose interests may differ from those of our public shareholders.\nWe are controlled by FNF through its wholly-owned subsidiary BKHI and certain affiliates of FNF and BKHI who beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 54.4% of the combined voting power of our common stock. As a result of this ownership, FNF has effective control over the outcome of votes on all matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and other significant corporate transactions. FNF can also cause BKHI and those of its affiliates that own interests in us to take actions that have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, which could prevent shareholders from receiving a premium for their shares. These actions may be taken even if other shareholders oppose them.\nIn addition, persons associated with FNF currently serve on our Board of Directors. The interests of FNF may not always coincide with the interests of our other shareholders, and the concentration of effective control in FNF will limit other shareholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters. The concentration of ownership and voting power of FNF, through BKHI and those of its affiliates that own interests in us, may also delay, defer or even prevent an acquisition by a third party or other change of control and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without their support, even if such events are in the best interests of our other shareholders. Therefore, the concentration of voting power controlled by FNF, through BKHI and those of its affiliates\nthat own interests in us, may have an adverse effect on the price of our Class A common stock. We may also take actions that our other shareholders do not view as beneficial, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and cause the value of your investment to decline.\nFurther, FNF may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financing or other transactions, including, but not limited to, the issuance of additional debt or equity and the declaration and payment of dividends, that, in its judgment, could enhance their equity investments, even though such transactions may involve risk to us or to our creditors. Additionally, FNF may make investments in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us, or may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the LLC Agreement and provisions of Delaware law may discourage or prevent strategic transactions, including a takeover of our company, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our shareholders.\nProvisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the LLC Agreement and provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, could delay or prevent a third party from entering into a strategic transaction with us, as applicable, even if such a transaction would benefit our shareholders. For example, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u2022\ndivide our Board of Directors into three classes with staggered three-year terms, which may delay or prevent a change of our management or a change of control;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by us upon approval of our Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares of capital stock, making a takeover more difficult and expensive;\n\u2022\nprovide that directors may be removed from office only for cause and that any vacancy on our Board of Directors may only be filled by a majority of our directors then in office, which may make it difficult for other shareholders to reconstitute our Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of the shareholders may be called only upon the request of a majority of our Board of Directors or by the chairman of the Board of Directors or our chief executive officer; and\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice to be given by shareholders for any shareholder proposals or director nominees.\nThese restrictions and provisions could keep us from pursuing relationships with strategic partners and from raising additional capital, which could impede our ability to expand our business and strengthen our competitive position. These restrictions could also limit shareholder value by impeding a sale of us or BKFS LLC.\nRisks Related to Owning Shares of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could fluctuate significantly, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price at which your shares were acquired. Those fluctuations could be based on various factors, including those described under \u201cRisks Related to Our Business\u201d and the following:\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the performance of our competitors and fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who follow us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nglobal, national or local economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, services, strategic investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our or our competitors\u2019 operating results, and our and our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u2022\nfailure by us or our competitors to meet analysts\u2019 projections or guidance we or our competitors may give the market;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations, or new interpretations or applications of laws and regulations, that are applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nthe arrival or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe number of shares publicly traded;\n\u2022\nfuture sales or issuances of our Class A common stock, including sales or issuances by us, our officers or directors and our significant shareholders, including BKHI, THL and certain of their respective affiliates; and\n\u2022\nother developments affecting us, our industry or our competitors.\nIn addition, in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions or interest rate changes, may cause declines in the market price of our Class A\ncommon stock. If the market price of our Class A common stock does not exceed the public offering price, you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment.\nAs we operate in a single industry, we are especially vulnerable to these factors to the extent that they affect our industry or our products. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation.\nIf we elect to issue shares of Class A common stock upon exchange or conversion of Units, in lieu of BKFS LLC making a cash payment, such issuance of Class A common stock may dilute your ownership of Class A common stock.\nEach outstanding Unit, together with one share of our Class B common stock, is exchangeable for a cash payment from BKFS LLC or, at our option, one share of Class A common stock. If we elect to issue shares of our Class A common stock in respect of these exchanges, your ownership of shares of Class A common stock will be diluted.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock is influenced in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our Class A common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A common stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe may retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment. We have not paid cash dividends to date and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. As a result of our current dividend policy, you may not receive any return on an investment in our Class A common stock unless you sell our Class A common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it. Any future determination to declare and pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant. Our ability to pay dividends depends on our receipt of cash dividends from our operating subsidiaries, which may further restrict our ability to pay dividends as a result of the laws of their jurisdiction of organization or agreements of our subsidiaries, including agreements governing our indebtedness. Any cash dividends, other than tax distributions, paid by BKFS LLC will be distributed pro-rata to its members, including us, BKHI and certain of its affiliates and certain THL Affiliates, according to the number of Units held. Existing or future agreements governing our indebtedness may also limit our ability to pay dividends.", "PERMNO": 92697, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "BKI"}
