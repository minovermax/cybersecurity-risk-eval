RISK FACTORS\nThe following is a discussion of certain important factors, some of which are beyond our control, that may cause our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired. Factors not currently known to Veritiv or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. You should carefully consider the following discussion, together with the other information contained in this report, in evaluating us and an investment in our common stock.\nRisks Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and in the future may materially and adversely affect, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nThe rapid spread of COVID-19, and the measures taken to slow its spread, have adversely affected our business and financial results and will likely continue to do so for an uncertain period of time in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have negative impacts on our business, including volatility in demand for our products; delays or inability to source products; disruptions in supply chain and transportation; and volatility in the global capital and credit markets, which impacts interest rates and currency exchange rates. The pandemic could also cause a material reduction in the values of our assets including, but not limited to, deferred tax assets, goodwill and intangibles. Our customers, suppliers and vendors may suffer disruptions in their business due to the COVID-19 pandemic causing them financial distress which could include delaying payments to us, filing for bankruptcy protection or going out of business. In addition, there are currently a large number of our employees working remotely as well as operationally critical employees working at our facilities for business continuity purposes as lawfully permitted. Extended periods of remote work arrangements could introduce further operational risk, such as additional cybersecurity risks. Despite our efforts to manage these impacts, due to the rapidly evolving situation with COVID-19, the effect on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict and in the future may have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. Such developments may include, but are not limited to, the spread and future resurgences of the virus, the severity and duration of the outbreak and the severity and duration of the resulting impact on the economy. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience impacts on our business as a result of any economic recession, downturn or volatility that has occurred or may occur in the future. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described below, including those related to dependence on information technology and telecommunications systems, cybersecurity risks, compliance with financial covenants, ability to service indebtedness and stock price fluctuation.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry and Business\nThe industry-wide decline in demand for paper and related products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Print and Publishing businesses rely heavily on the sale of paper and related products. The industry-wide decrease in demand for paper and related products in key markets we serve places continued pressure on our revenues and profit margins and makes it more difficult to maintain or grow earnings. This trend is expected to continue. The failure to effectively differentiate us from our competitors in the face of increased use of email, increased and permanent product substitution, including less print advertising, more electronic billing, more e-commerce, fewer catalogs and a reduced volume or slowdown of mail, could have a material adverse effect on market share, sales and profitability through increased expenditures or decreased prices. Our failure to grow the Packaging and Facility Solutions businesses at rates adequate to offset the expected decline in Print and Publishing could also have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nCompetition in our industry may adversely impact our margins and our ability to retain customers and make it difficult to maintain our market share and profitability.\nThe business-to-business distribution industry is highly competitive, with numerous regional and local competitors, and is a mature industry characterized by slowing revenue growth. Our principal competitors include national distributors, national and regional manufacturers and independent brokers in the Packaging segment; national, regional and local distributors in the Facility Solutions segment; regional and local distributors in the Print segment; and regional, national and international paper manufacturers and other merchants and brokers in the Publishing segment. Most of these competitors generally offer a wide range of products at prices comparable to those we offer. Additionally, new competition could arise from non-traditional sources, group purchasing organizations, e-commerce, discount wholesalers or consolidation among competitors. New competitive sources may result in increased focus on pricing and on limiting price increases, or may require increased discounting. Such competition may result in margin erosion or make it difficult to attract and retain customers.\nIncreased competition within the industry, reduced demand for paper, increased and permanent product substitution through less print advertising, more electronic billing, more e-commerce, fewer catalogs, a reduced volume or slowdown of\nmail and general economic conditions has served to further increase pressure on the industry's profit margins, and continued margin pressure within the industry may have a material adverse impact on our operating results and profitability.\nWe purchase all of the products we sell to our customers from other parties, and conditions beyond our control can interrupt our supplies and increase our product costs.\nWe obtain our packaging, facility products and paper from third-party suppliers. Our business and financial results are dependent on our ability to purchase products from suppliers not controlled by us that we, in turn, sell to our customers. We may not be able to obtain the products we need on open credit, with market or other favorable terms, or at all. During the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 30% of our purchases were made from ten suppliers. A sustained disruption in our ability to source products from one or more of the largest of these vendors might have a material impact on our ability to fulfill customer orders resulting in lost sales and, in rare cases, damages for late or non-delivery.\nFor the most part, we do not have a significant number of long-term contracts with our suppliers committing them to provide products to us. Suppliers may not provide the products and supplies needed in the quantities and at the prices and times requested. We are also subject to delays caused by interruption in production and increases in product costs based on conditions outside of our control. These conditions include raw material shortages, environmental restrictions on operations, work slowdowns, work interruptions, strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers, product recalls, transportation interruptions, unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs, competitive demands and natural disasters or other catastrophic events. Our inability to obtain adequate supplies of packaging, facility products and paper as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to customers, and customers may turn to other distributors.\nIn addition, increases in product costs may reduce our margins if we are unable to pass all or a portion of these costs along to our customers, which we have historically had difficulty doing. Any such inability may have a negative impact on our business and our profitability.\nChanges in prices for raw materials, including pulp, paper and resin, could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in prices for raw materials, such as pulp, paper and resin, could significantly impact our results of operations in the print market. Although we do not produce paper products and are not directly exposed to risk associated with production, declines in pulp and paper prices, driven by falling secular demand, periods of industry overcapacity and overproduction by paper suppliers, may adversely affect our revenues and net income to the extent such factors produce lower paper prices. Declining pulp and paper prices generally produce lower revenues and profits, even when volume and trading margin percentages remain constant. During periods of declining pulp and paper prices, customers may alter purchasing patterns and defer paper purchases or deplete inventory levels until long-term price stability occurs. Alternatively, if prices for raw materials rise and we are unable to pass these increases on to our customers, our results of operations and profits may also be negatively impacted.\nChanges in U.S. and international trade policies and regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAlthough we primarily serve markets in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, we purchase our products from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers. Changes to U.S. trade policies, including the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, sanctions and other related governmental actions or policies, can disrupt geographic and industry demand trends and prompt other countries to change their own trade policies, including through the adoption of retaliatory tariffs or expansion of other trade restrictions. These changes may cause us to make changes in our supply chain strategies or adversely impact our own costs. Increasing the costs of our products as a result of tariffs or other adverse trade restrictions, or minimizing the number of our products subject to tariffs or other adverse trade restrictions, could cause customers to turn to other distributors and we may be unable to locate alternative suppliers at acceptable costs. Such actions may result in margin erosion or make it difficult to attract and retain customers.\nIncreases in the cost of fuel and third-party freight as well as the availability of third-party freight providers could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nVolatile fuel prices have a direct impact on our business. We also depend upon third-party freight providers in order\nto conduct our business. The cost of fuel and third-party freight affects the price paid by us for products as well as the expense incurred to deliver products to our customers. Increased fuel costs, increased government regulation and limitations on driver availability impacting the freight transportation industry may adversely impact the cost and availability of third-party freight services. Although we have been able to pass along a portion of increased fuel and third-party freight costs to our customers in the past, there is no guarantee that we can continue to do so. Increases in fuel and third-party freight costs or the unavailability of third-party freight providers may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe loss of any of our significant customers could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur ten largest customers generated approximately 10% of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020, and our largest customer accounted for approximately 4% of our consolidated net sales in that same period. We cannot guarantee that we will maintain or improve our relationships with these customers or that we will continue to supply these customers at historic levels.\nGenerally, our customers are not contractually required to purchase any minimum amount of products. In addition, consolidation among customers could also result in changes to their purchasing habits and volumes. The loss of one or more of these significant customers, a significant customer's decision to purchase our products in substantially lower quantities than they have in the past, or a deterioration in the relationship with any significant customers could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nWe may not fully realize the expected benefits of our current and future restructuring plans or other operating or cost-saving initiatives, which may adversely affect our business, competitive position, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have initiated a restructuring plan in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations and the ongoing secular changes in our Print and Publishing segments (the \"2020 Restructuring Plan\"). The 2020 Restructuring Plan is designed to better align our cost structure with ongoing business needs as we execute on our stated corporate strategy. We may undertake additional restructuring plans in the future, including in connection with our ongoing evaluation of alternatives to restructure our integrated supply chain. Implementation of the 2020 Restructuring Plan or any subsequent restructuring plan may be disruptive to our business or more costly than anticipated, and we may not be able to obtain the estimated cost savings and other benefits that were initially anticipated in a timely manner, or at all. Additionally, as a result of any restructuring plan, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiency during transitional periods. Reorganization and restructuring can require a significant amount of management and other employees\u2019 time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. In addition, any restructuring plan may have other consequences, such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce, a negative effect on employee morale and productivity or our ability to attract highly skilled employees. Moreover, our competitors may also use our restructuring plans to seek to gain a competitive advantage over us. Failure to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plans could have a material adverse effect on our business, competitive position, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business continues to evolve, we may need to further adjust or expand our 2020 Restructuring Plan, which could increase the risks described above.\nAdverse developments in general business and economic conditions, including the industry-wide decline in demand for paper and related products, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations impairing our ability to use Net Operating Loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards and other deferred tax assets.\nThe realization of our NOLs and other deferred tax assets depends on the timing and amount of taxable income earned by our Company in the future and a lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to realize these tax assets. Tax attributes are generally subject to expiration at various times in the future to the extent that they have not previously been applied to offset the taxable income of our Company, and there is a risk that our existing NOL carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities.\nThe Merger resulted in an ownership change for Unisource under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\"), limiting the use of Unisource's NOLs to offset future taxable income for both U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Moreover, future trading of our stock may result in additional ownership changes as defined under Section 382 of the Code, further limiting the use of Unisource's NOLs. These limitations may affect the availability and the timing of when\nthese NOLs may be used which could impair our deferred tax assets which, in turn, may adversely impact the timing and amount of cash taxes payable by our Company.\nSignificant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income, as well as successful implementation of various tax planning strategies. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates with respect to the valuation allowances are appropriate and reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ from projected results, which could give rise to additions to valuation allowances or reductions in valuation allowances. It is possible that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the amount of income tax expense (benefit) recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our material intellectual property and other proprietary rights, or to defend successfully against intellectual property infringement claims by third parties.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our intellectual property rights, including but not limited to trademarks, copyrights and proprietary technology. The use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect intellectual property rights and proprietary technology may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect proprietary technology, or to defend against claims by third parties that our conduct or our use of intellectual property infringes upon such third party's intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property litigation or claims brought against us, whether or not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained. The terms of any settlement or judgment may require us to pay substantial amounts to the other party or cease exercising our rights in such intellectual property, including ceasing the use of certain trademarks used by us to distinguish our services from those of others or ceasing the exercise of our rights in copyrightable works. In addition, we may be required to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party's rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected as a result.\nRisks Relating to Human Capital\nIn order to compete, we must attract, train and retain highly qualified employees, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nTo successfully compete, we must attract, train and retain a large number of highly qualified employees while controlling related labor costs. Specifically, we must recruit and retain qualified sales professionals. If we were to lose a significant amount of our sales professionals, we could lose a material amount of sales, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Many of our sales professionals are subject to confidentiality and non-competition agreements. If our sales professionals were to violate these agreements, we could seek to legally enforce these agreements, but we may incur substantial costs in connection with such enforcement and may not be successful in such enforcement. We compete with other businesses for employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees. The inability to retain or hire qualified personnel at economically reasonable compensation levels would restrict our ability to improve our business and result in lower operating results and profitability.\nOur pension and health care costs are subject to numerous factors which could cause these costs to change.\nOur pension and health care costs are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience, including, for pension costs, actuarial assumptions regarding life expectancies. Pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity market returns, changes in general interest rates and changes in the number of retirees may result in increased pension costs in future periods. Significant changes in any of these factors may adversely impact our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe participate in multi-employer pension plans and multi-employer health and welfare plans, which could create additional obligations and payment liabilities.\nWe contribute to multi-employer defined benefit pension plans as well as multi-employer health and welfare plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover certain unionized employee groups in the U.S. The risks of\nparticipating in multi-employer pension plans differ from single employer-sponsored plans and such plans are subject to regulation under the Pension Protection Act (the \"PPA\"). Additionally, changes in regulations covering these plans could increase our costs and/or potential withdrawal liability.\nMulti-employer pension plans are cost-sharing plans subject to collective-bargaining agreements. Contributions to a multi-employer plan by one employer are not specifically earmarked for its employees and may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan are borne by the remaining participating employers. In addition, if a multi-employer plan is determined to be underfunded based on the criteria established by the PPA, the plan may be required to implement a financial improvement plan or rehabilitation plan that may require additional contributions or surcharges by participating employers.\nIn addition to the contributions discussed above, we could be obligated to pay additional amounts, known as withdrawal liabilities, upon decrease or cessation of participation in a multi-employer pension plan. Although an employer may obtain an estimate of such liability, the final calculation of the withdrawal liability may not be able to be determined for an extended period of time. Generally, the cash obligation of such withdrawal liability is payable over a 20-year period.\nOur business may be adversely affected by work stoppages, union negotiations and labor disputes.\nApproximately 9% of our employees were in collective bargaining units as of December 31, 2020. Historically, the effects of collective bargaining and other similar labor agreements have not been significant. However, if a larger number of our employees were to unionize, including in the wake of any future legislation or administrative regulation that makes it easier for employees to unionize, the effect may be negative.\nApproximately 63% of the Company's unionized employees have collective bargaining agreements that expire during 2021. Any inability to negotiate acceptable new contracts under these collective bargaining arrangements could cause strikes or other work stoppages, and new contracts could result in increased operating costs. If any such strikes or other work stoppages occur, or if additional employees become represented by a union, a disruption of our operations and higher labor costs could result. Labor relations matters affecting our suppliers of products and services could also adversely affect our business from time to time.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure\nOur significant indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $603.8 million in total indebtedness, reflecting borrowings of $520.2 million under the Asset-Based Lending Facility (the \"ABL Facility\"), $1.3 million under short-term debt and $82.3 million of finance leases. This level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial condition, operating results and business, including the following:\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022increasing our cost of borrowing;\n\u2022requiring that a significant portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to payments on our indebtedness instead of other purposes, including operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness or satisfy other obligations;\n\u2022exposing us to risk of increased interest rates on our borrowings due to the variable rate exposure associated with the ABL Facility, which can be worsened by (i) increased interest rates up to the level covered by our interest rate cap and (ii) increased interest rates on borrowings in excess of the notional amount of our interest rate cap;\n\u2022limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business, and making us unable to carry out capital spending that is important to our growth.\nDespite our significant indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future. This could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nWe may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, including secured indebtedness. Although the agreements governing the ABL Facility contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new indebtedness is added to our current indebtedness levels, the related risks we will face could intensify.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants, which could restrict our operational flexibility, and a failure to comply with those covenants could have serious consequences.\nThe agreements governing the ABL Facility contain restrictions and limitations on our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests, including financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness or guaranties, or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions;\n\u2022repurchase, prepay or redeem subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022make investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022create liens;\n\u2022make negative pledges;\n\u2022consolidate or merge with another company;\n\u2022sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022change the nature of our business.\nThe agreements governing the ABL Facility also contain other restrictions customary for asset-based facilities of this nature. Our ability to borrow additional amounts under the ABL Facility will depend upon satisfaction of these covenants. Events beyond our control could affect our ability to meet these covenants. Our failure to comply with obligations under the agreements governing the ABL Facility may result in an event of default under those agreements. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. This could have serious consequences to our business, financial condition and operating results and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in the operating results of our Company due to factors related to our business;\n\u2022success or failure of the strategy of our Company;\n\u2022the quarterly or annual earnings of our Company, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022continued industry-wide decrease in demand for paper and related products;\n\u2022our ability to obtain third-party financing as needed;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022restrictions on our ability to pay dividends under our ABL Facility;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022investor perception of our Company;\n\u2022natural or environmental disasters that investors believe may affect our Company;\n\u2022overall market fluctuations;\n\u2022a large sale of our stock by a significant shareholder;\n\u2022results from any material litigation or government investigation;\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations affecting our Company or any of the principal products sold by our Company; and\n\u2022general economic and political conditions and other external factors.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research, or publish unfavorable research, about our Company, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us and our business. As of December 31, 2020, we had very limited research coverage by analysts. If the current coverage of our Company by securities or industry analysts ceases, the trading price for our stock would be negatively impacted. In addition, if one or more of these analysts downgrades our stock or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our Company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nA significant percentage of our outstanding common stock is held by our three largest shareholders, and certain of those shareholders exercise significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval. So long as a significant percentage of our common stock continues to be held by a small number of shareholders, the liquidity of our common stock may be impacted, and future sales by those shareholders may result in a reduction in the market price of our common stock.\nOur three largest shareholders collectively owned approximately 43% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2020. As a result, certain of these shareholders may exercise significant influence over all matters requiring shareholder approval, including approval of significant corporate transactions, which may reduce the market price of our common stock. Additionally, the interests of these shareholders may conflict with the interests of our other shareholders.\nThis concentrated ownership could also result in a limited amount of shares being available to be traded in the market, resulting in reduced liquidity. Further, all of the shares of our common stock owned by UWW Holdings, LLC (the \"UWWH Stockholder\") are registered for resale under the Securities Act of 1933 and, subject to certain limitations, all or a portion of such shares may be offered and sold to the public in the future. When some or all of the shares held by the UWWH Stockholder are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter and amended and restated by-laws (our \"by-laws\") could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur charter and by-laws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that shareholders may consider favorable. For example, our charter and by-laws collectively:\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022limit the ability of shareholders to remove directors;\n\u2022provide that vacancies on our board of directors, including vacancies resulting from an enlargement of our board of directors, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022prohibit shareholders from calling special meetings of shareholders unless called by the holders of not less than 20% of our outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u2022prohibit shareholder action by written consent, unless initiated by the holders of not less than 20% of the outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of our shareholders; and\n\u2022require the approval of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock to amend our by-laws and certain provisions of our charter.\nThese provisions may prevent our shareholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nOur charter and by-laws may also make it difficult for shareholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our shareholders.\nOur charter designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur charter provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our shareholders by any of our directors, officers or employees, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any director, officer, employee or agent arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our charter or by-laws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision in our charter may limit our shareholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nWe have not historically declared or paid dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have not historically declared or paid dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth, to develop our business, for working capital needs, to reduce debt and for general corporate purposes. Therefore, the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain their current value.\nAny decision to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of Veritiv's Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors then existing, including earnings, financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, restrictions imposed by applicable law, general business conditions and other factors that Veritiv's Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries. As such, to the extent that we determine in the future to pay dividends on our common stock, none of our subsidiaries will be obligated to make funds available to us for the payment of dividends. Further, the agreements governing our ABL Facility can, and agreements governing future indebtedness may, in certain circumstances, restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer assets to us.\nRisks Relating to Regulatory Compliance and Legal Matters\nCosts to comply with environmental, health and safety laws, and to satisfy any liability or obligation imposed under such laws, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to U.S. and international environmental, health and safety laws, including laws regulating the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, the use, storage, treatment, disposal and management of hazardous substances and waste, the investigation and remediation of contamination and the health and safety of our employees and the public. We could incur substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), investigation, remediation and closure costs and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities or obligations under, environmental, health and safety laws. We could be held liable for the costs to address contamination at any real property we have ever owned, operated or used as a disposal site.\nIn addition, changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of other environmental liabilities or obligations in the future, may lead to additional compliance or other costs that could impact our business and results of operations. Moreover, as environmental issues, such as climate change, have become more prevalent, U.S. and foreign governments have responded, and may continue to respond, with increased legislation and regulation, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nExpenditures related to the cost of compliance with laws, rules and regulations could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to U.S. and international laws and regulations, including regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the import and export of goods, customs regulations, Office of Foreign Asset Control and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977. Expenditures related to the cost of compliance with laws, rules and regulations, tariffs and duties could adversely impact our business and results of operations. In addition, we could incur substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures) and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, laws, regulations, codes and common law.\nChanges in U.S. federal and state or foreign tax law, tax assessments and unclaimed property audits by governmental authorities could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe remit a variety of taxes and fees to various U.S. federal and state and foreign governmental authorities, including income taxes, excise taxes, property taxes, sales and use taxes and payroll taxes. From time to time, governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law. In addition, tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. The taxes and fees remitted by us are subject to review and audit by the applicable governmental authorities which could result in liability for additional assessments. Furthermore, we are subject to U.S. state unclaimed property (escheat) laws and audits which require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others held by us that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time. Although management believes that the positions we have taken are reasonable, various taxing authorities may challenge certain of the positions we have taken, which may also potentially result in additional liabilities for taxes, unclaimed property, interest and penalties in excess of accrued liabilities. Changes in tax laws or an unfavorable resolution of assessments by a governmental authority could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in future periods.\nResults of legal proceedings relating to the products and distribution thereof, and regulatory inquiries or investigations by government authorities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with the products and equipment we sell, distribute and service. As we do not have direct control over the quality of the products manufactured or supplied by such third-party suppliers, we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of the products and equipment we sell, distribute and service. It is possible that inventory from a manufacturer or supplier could be sold to our customers and later be alleged to have quality problems or to have caused personal injury, subjecting us to potential claims from customers or third parties. Our ability to hold such manufacturer or supplier liable will depend on a variety of factors, including its financial viability. Moreover, increasing the number of private label products that we distribute could increase our exposure to potential liability for product liability claims. Finally, even if we are successful in defending any claim relating to the products or equipment we distribute, claims of this nature could negatively impact our reputation and customer confidence in our products, equipment and company. We have been subject to such claims in the past, which have been resolved without material financial impact. We also operate a significant number of facilities and a large fleet of trucks and other vehicles and therefore face the risk of premises-related liabilities and vehicle-related liabilities including traffic accidents.\nFrom time to time, we may also be involved in government inquiries and investigations, as well as class action, employment and other litigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by government authorities. The costs and other effects of pending litigation against us cannot be determined with certainty. There can be no assurance that the outcome of any lawsuit or claim or its effect on our business or financial condition will be as expected. The defense of these lawsuits and claims may divert our management's attention, and significant expenses may be incurred as a result. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we currently maintain insurance coverage to address some of these types of liabilities, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or that any such insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential claims. In addition, we may choose not to seek to obtain such insurance in the future. Moreover, indemnification rights that we have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential\nloss exposures.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nAdverse developments in general business and economic conditions as well as conditions in the global capital and credit markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products, the business, and the financial condition and results of operations of our Company and our customers.\nThe persistently slow rate of increase in the U.S. gross domestic product (\"GDP\") in recent years has adversely affected our results of operations. If GDP continues to increase at a slow rate or if economic growth declines, demand for the products we sell will be adversely affected. In addition, volatility in the global capital and credit markets, which impacts interest rates, currency exchange rates and the availability of credit, could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of our Company and our customers. Financial difficulties of customers, whether as a result of a downturn in general economic or industry conditions or otherwise, may result in failures of customers to timely pay amounts due or adversely affect the collectability of our accounts receivable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also have exposure to counterparties with which we routinely execute transactions. A bankruptcy or liquidity event by one or more of our customers or counterparties, such as financial institutions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in business conditions in our international operations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur operating results and business prospects could be substantially affected by risks related to Canada, Mexico and other non-U.S. countries where we sell and distribute or purchase our products. Some of our operations are in or near locations that have suffered from political, social and economic issues; civil unrest; and a high level of criminal activity. In those locations where we have employees or operations, we may incur substantial costs to maintain the safety of our personnel and the security of our operations. Downturns in economic activity, adverse tax consequences or any change in social, political or labor conditions in any of the countries in which we operate could negatively affect our financial results. In addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under U.S. law (including, among others, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977) and other laws related to operations in foreign jurisdictions. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions and the prosecution of executives.\nInclement weather, widespread outbreak of an illness, anti-terrorism measures and other disruptions could negatively affect various aspects of our business including our supply chain, distribution system and operations, and could result in reduced demand from our customers.\nOur ability to provide efficient distribution of products to our customers is an integral component of our overall business strategy. Disruptions at distribution centers or shipping ports or the closure of roads or imposition of other driving bans due to natural events such as flooding, tornadoes and blizzards may affect our ability to both maintain key products in inventory and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis, which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations.\nAdditionally, widespread outbreaks of an illness such as a pandemic and actions taken to contain or prevent further spread of such diseases could substantially interfere with general commercial activity related to our supply chain and customer base, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our operations are curtailed, we may need to seek alternate sources of supply which may be more expensive, unavailable or may result in delays in shipments to us from our supply chain and subsequently to our customers. Further, if our customers\u2019 businesses are similarly affected, they might delay or reduce purchases from us, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nFurthermore, in the aftermath of terrorist attacks in the U.S., federal, state and local authorities have implemented and continue to implement various security measures that affect many parts of the transportation network in the U.S. and abroad. Our customers typically require delivery of products in short time frames and rely on our on-time delivery capabilities. If security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries, we may fail to meet the needs of our\ncustomers, or may incur increased expenses to do so. Any of these disruptions to our operations may reduce our sales and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a variety of information technology (\"IT\") and telecommunications systems and the Internet, and any failure of these systems could adversely impact our business and operating results.\nWe depend on IT and telecommunications systems and the Internet for our operations. These systems support a variety of functions including inventory management, order placement and processing with vendors and from customers, shipping, shipment tracking and billing. Our information systems are vulnerable to natural disasters, wide-area telecommunications or power utility outages, terrorist or cyber-attacks and other major disruptions, and our redundant information systems may not operate effectively.\nFailures or significant downtime of our IT or telecommunications systems for any reason could prevent us from taking customer orders, printing product pick-lists, shipping products, billing customers and handling call volume. Sales also may be adversely impacted if our reseller and retail customers are unable to access pricing and product availability information. We also rely on the Internet, electronic data interchange and other electronic integrations for a large portion of our orders and information exchanges with our suppliers and customers. The Internet and individual websites have experienced a number of disruptions and slowdowns, some of which were caused by organized attacks. In addition, some websites have experienced security breakdowns. If we were to experience a security breakdown, disruption or breach that compromised sensitive information, it could harm our relationships with our suppliers and customers. Disruption of our website or the Internet in general could impair our order processing or more generally prevent our suppliers and resellers from accessing information. Failures of our systems could also lead to delivery delays and may expose us to litigation and penalties under some of our contracts. Any significant increase in our IT and telecommunications costs or temporary or permanent loss of our IT or telecommunications systems could harm our relationships with our customers and suppliers and result in lost sales, business delays and bad publicity. The occurrence of any of these events, as well as the costs we may incur in preventing or responding to such events, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive company, customer, employee and vendor information as well as breaches in the technology that manages operations and other business processes.\nOur operations rely upon secure IT systems for data capture, processing, storage and reporting. Our IT systems, and those of our third-party providers, could become subject to cyber-attacks. The evolving nature of threats to data security, in light of new and sophisticated methods used by criminals and cyberterrorists, state-sponsored organizations and nation-states, including computer viruses, malware, phishing, misrepresentation, social engineering and forgery, make it increasingly challenging to anticipate and adequately mitigate these risks. Network, system, application and data breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation including, but not limited to, interruption of systems availability, or denial of access to and misuse of applications required by our customers to conduct business with us. Access to internal applications required to plan our operations, source materials, ship finished goods and account for orders could be denied or misused. Theft of intellectual property or trade secrets, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, could stem from such incidents. Any operational disruptions or misappropriation of information could harm our relationship with our customers and suppliers, result in lost sales, business delays and negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 14751, "SIC": 5110, "TIC": "VRTV"}
