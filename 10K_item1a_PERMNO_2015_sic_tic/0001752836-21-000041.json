{"cik": "1752836", "company": "COVETRUS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSummary of Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The following is a summary of the principal risk factors described in this section:\n\u2022Health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and on our ability to maintain effective internal controls\n\u2022Customers may be hesitant to migrate or integrate their critical business systems and procedures to those provided by us, and as a result, the market and the sales cycle for our technology and services may develop slower than expected\n\u2022We compete in the highly competitive animal-health market\n\u2022Changes in manufacturer sales channels and the increase in e-commerce options for companion animal products could negatively impact our market share, margins, and distribution of our products\n\u2022Our dependency on third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all of our products could impact our business and results of operations\n\u2022Price sensitivity of our Customers and Animal Owners could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows\n\u2022Any defects, disruptions or poor service in our technology product offerings could result in loss of our Customers and create difficulty in attracting new customers\n\u2022Interruptions, damage by unforeseen events, cyberattacks and failure in our information systems (or third-party systems we rely on) or unauthorized access to a Customer\u2019s or their Client\u2019s data may cause significant liabilities and curtail or stop use of our products or services\n\u2022Legislative and regulatory burdens imposed on our storage, processing and usage of Customer and Animal Owners information may expose us to liability and potential objections, and our failure to adequately protect or appropriately use data could negatively affect our business and results of operations\n\u2022Risks associated with our significant operations in foreign jurisdictions could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows\n\u2022International sales are important for future growth of our business, and our recent and continuing international expansion efforts subject us to additional risks\n\u2022We are subject to substantial regulation in our business and operations and failure to comply with, or material changes to such regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations\nProspective investors should carefully consider the risks described in this section, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks may not be the only risks we face but are risks we believe may be material at this time. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think are immaterial, may also impair our business operations or financial results. If any of the events or circumstances described in this section occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations, and the trading price of our securities, could decline. Investors and prospective investors should consider these risks, the information contained under the heading Forward-Looking Statements and the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding whether to invest in our securities. We may update these risk factors in our future periodic reports.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe face risk related to health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and could also have an effect on our ability to maintain effective internal controls.\nOur business has been and could continue to be adversely affected by a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, including the recent pandemic of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus known as COVID-19. Global health concerns relating to the COVID-19 pandemic have been weighing on the macroeconomic environment, and the pandemic has significantly increased economic volatility and uncertainty.\nThe pandemic has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, and business shutdowns. These measures may adversely impact our employees and operations and the operations of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and may negatively impact spending patterns, payment cycles, insurance coverage levels, and demand for our products and services. Such measures may remain in place for a significant period of time and may adversely affect our results of operations. Despite an\nCovetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 19\nincrease in net sales in the first quarter of 2020 relative to the prior year period, net sales weakened from mid-March to late-April and then recovered; however, it is possible that we may experience more significant declines in the future.\nThe spread of COVID-19 caused us to modify our business practices, particularly with respect to our liquidity position and near-term cost structure (including through incremental borrowings on our revolving credit facility to increase cash, which have subsequently been repaid; reduction of non-critical capital expenditures; executive, board, and other senior-level employee compensation reductions that have been reversed subsequent to June 30, 2020; employee furloughs, certain shift eliminations, and a hiring freeze that have been reversed or eased; discretionary spending deferrals; the deferral of payroll taxes under the CARES Act; and the temporary suspension of our 401(k) employer match, which has been reinstated). We also managed our inventory levels to ensure we hold appropriate stock for market conditions and have engaged in negotiations to extend payment terms on certain contracts. We may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, and business partners. There is no certainty that such actions will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities. If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including due to illness, quarantines, social distancing, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations will be negatively impacted, and our stock price could decline.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and potentially our control procedures is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Such impact will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, the timing of the vaccination rollout, and how quickly, and to what extent, normal economic and operating activities can resume. In the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic led to increased volatility in our stock price and a sustained decline in our market capitalization which required us to perform an interim impairment review, which could reoccur. In addition, due to current internal policies, many of our employees continue to work remotely, which could have an adverse effect on our internal control over financial reporting. The COVID-19 pandemic could also limit the ability of our customers, suppliers, and business partners to perform, including our customers' ability to make timely payments to us during and following the pandemic. We may also experience a suspension of services from third parties. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience an adverse impact to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession that has occurred or that may occur in the future.\nSpecifically, difficult macroeconomic conditions, such as decreases in per capita income and level of disposable income, increased and prolonged unemployment, or a decline in consumer confidence as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and services. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing our services or choosing not to purchase our products. Decreased demand for our products and services could negatively affect our overall financial performance.\nThere are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19 and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of COVID-19\u2019s impact on our business, our operations, control procedures, or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and could cause continued volatility in our stock price. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.\nWe may not successfully implement our business strategies.\nWe are pursuing, and will continue to pursue, strategic initiatives that management considers critical to our long-term success, including: leveraging the scale, reach and infrastructure of our supply chain network to accelerate the adoption of our Prescription Management platform; increasing sales to our Customers; driving category growth; developing advanced insight and analytics and software; and enhancing Customer and Animal Owners relationships. There are significant risks involved with the execution of these initiatives, including significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. Accordingly, we cannot predict whether we will succeed in implementing these strategic initiatives. It could take several years to realize the anticipated benefits from these initiatives, if any benefits are achieved at all. Additionally, our business strategy may change from time to time, which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business.\nSince Customers may be hesitant to migrate or integrate their critical business systems and procedures to those provided by us, the market and the sales cycle for our technology and services may develop more slowly than we expect.\nOur success depends, in part, on the willingness of Customers to adopt new technology and services. Many veterinary practices have invested substantial effort and financial resources into the information systems and procedures that support their businesses\nCovetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 20\nand may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate or integrate these systems with online or cloud-based, on-demand services. Other factors that may affect market acceptance of our services include:\n\u2022The security capabilities, reliability, and availability of on-demand services,\n\u2022Concerns with entrusting a third party to maintain and manage data, especially confidential or sensitive data,\n\u2022Our ability to minimize the time and resources required to implement our services,\n\u2022Our ability to maintain high levels of Customer satisfaction,\n\u2022Our ability to implement upgrades and other changes to our software without disrupting services we provide,\n\u2022The level of customization or configuration we offer,\n\u2022The ability to provide rapid response time during periods of intense activity on Customer websites, and\n\u2022The price, performance and availability of competing products and services\nThe market for these services may develop more slowly than we expect, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe animal-health market is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe animal-health market is highly competitive and rapidly changing, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. Our competitors include the animal-health businesses of large pharmaceutical and distribution companies, specialty animal-health businesses, animal-health focused businesses, practice management service providers, and Internet-based businesses, such as Chewy, Inc. and PetMed Express, Inc., also known as 1-800-PetMeds, and may, in the future, include new market entrants. Some of our competitors have access to greater financial, marketing, technical, and other resources than us that could allow them to compete more effectively.\nIf any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor such as technological advances or newer low-cost business models with the ability to operate at higher gross margins, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. Additional competitive pressure could arise from, among other things, limited demand growth or a significant number of additional competitive products or services being introduced into a particular market, price reductions by competitors, or the ability of competitors to capitalize on their economies of scale.\nChanges in manufacturer sales channels and the increase in e-commerce options for companion animal products could negatively impact our market share, margins, and distribution of our products.\nIn most markets, companion Animal Owners typically purchase their animal-health products directly from veterinarians. Companion Animal Owners increasingly have the option to purchase animal-health products from sources other than veterinarians, such as online retailers, \u201cbig-box\u201d retail stores or other over-the-counter distribution channels. This trend has been demonstrated, for example, by the significant shift away from the veterinarian distribution channel in the sale of flea and tick products in recent years. Additionally, major U.S. online e-commerce retailers such as Amazon and Chewy.com are becoming licensed as veterinary mail order pharmacies to offer pharmacy products directly to consumers in all 50 US states. Even where prescriptions must be written by a veterinarian, companion Animal Owners may shift to these services for home delivery of prescription medications and diets. Decreased emphasis on veterinary visits, and increased consumer choice through familiar e-commerce retailers could reduce demand for veterinarian-based e-commerce services and have a material adverse impact on our business. We market our companion animal prescription products through the veterinarian channel, both in-office and through our online platform, any decrease in reliance on, and visits to, veterinarians by companion Animal Owners could reduce our market share for such products and have a material adverse effect on our business. Companion Animal Owners may further choose to substitute human health products for animal-health products if human health products are deemed to be lower-cost alternatives.\nBecause the majority of all the products that we distribute and sell are not manufactured by us, we are dependent on third parties for the manufacture and supply of substantially all our products.\nWe obtain substantially all our products from third parties. Generally, we do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers committing them to supply products to us. Therefore, suppliers may not provide the products we need in the quantities we request or at all. Additionally, certain key suppliers, in the aggregate, supply a significant portion of the products we sell. In addition, we currently purchase many products and materials from single sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. These products include branded and patented products from major pharmaceutical manufacturers, including Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, Elanco Animal Health Incorporated, Merck & Co., Inc., Vedco, Inc., and Zoetis, Inc., among others. These five suppliers accounted for approximately 50% of our purchases for the year ended December 31, 2020. Effective January 1, 2021, we no longer are\nCovetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 21\npartnered with Merck & Co., in the U.K. which will result in reduced Net sales in future periods. We are taking steps to mitigate these effects and do not expect the profitability impact to be significant. Additionally, if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from single-source suppliers, we may be unable to supply the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, because we generally do not control the actual production of the products we sell, we may be subject to delays caused by interruption in production based on conditions outside of our control, including interruption due to physical loss of the manufacturers' or their suppliers facilities and the manufacturers\u2019 failure to comply with applicable government requirements. The failure of manufacturers of products regulated by the FDA, the DEA, or other governmental agencies to meet these requirements could result in product recall, cessation of sales or other market disruptions. If any of our third-party suppliers were to become unable or unwilling to continue to provide the products in our required volumes, we would need to identify and obtain acceptable replacement sources on a timely basis. There is no guarantee that we would be able to obtain such alternative sources of supply on a timely basis, if at all. An extended interruption in the supply of our products, especially any high-sales volume product, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDisruptive innovations and advances in medical practices and technologies could negatively affect the market for our products.\nThe market for our products could be impacted negatively by the introduction and broad market acceptance of newly-developed or alternative products that address the diseases and conditions for which we sell products, including \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cholistic\u201d health products or specially bred disease-resistant animals. In addition, technological breakthroughs by others may obviate our technology and reduce or eliminate the market for our products. Introduction or acceptance of such products or technologies could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nAnimal health products are subject to unanticipated safety, quality or efficacy concerns, which may harm our reputation.\nUnanticipated safety, quality or efficacy concerns arise from time to time with respect to animal health products, whether or not scientifically or clinically supported, leading to product recalls, withdrawals or suspended or declining sales, as well as product liability and other claims.\nRegulatory actions based on these types of safety, quality or efficacy concerns could impact all, or a significant portion, of a product\u2019s sales and could, depending on the circumstances, materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, since we depend on positive perceptions of the safety, quality and efficacy of our products, and animal health products generally, by veterinarians and pet owners, any concern as to the safety, quality or efficacy of our products, whether actual or perceived, may harm our reputation. These concerns and the related harm to our reputation could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of whether such reports are accurate.\nMany of our Customers and Animal Owners are price sensitive, and if the prices for our products and services are unacceptable to them, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs the market for our services matures, or as new competitors introduce new products or services that compete with us, we may be unable to retain our existing Customers or attract new customers based on the same pricing model as previously used. As a result, it is possible that competitive dynamics in our market may require us to change our pricing model or reduce our prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may lose Customers and have difficulty attracting new customers if we have defects, disruptions, or poor service in our technology product offerings.\nBecause we deliver online and cloud-based applications as a service, errors or defects in the software applications underlying the service, or a failure of our hosting infrastructure, may render the service unavailable to Customers. Since our Customers will use our platform to manage critical aspects of their businesses, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with the platform, whether in connection with the day-to-day operation of the platform, upgrades or otherwise, could damage the Customers\u2019 businesses. If we experience any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems with our online and cloud-based services, Customers could delay or withhold payment or stop doing business with us, and our business, results of operations and reputation could be harmed.\nCovetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 22\nConsolidation of our customers and distributors could negatively affect the pricing of our products.\nVeterinarians are our primary customers. In recent years, there has been a trend towards the concentration of veterinarians in large clinics and hospitals. In addition, our distributors have seen consolidation in their industries. Furthermore, we have seen the expansion of corporate customers, including larger cross-border ones, and an increase in the consolidation of buying groups (cooperatives of veterinary practices that leverage volume to pursue discounts from manufacturers). The pace of consolidation and structure of markets varies greatly across geographies. If these trends towards consolidation continue, these customers and distributors could attempt to improve their profitability by leveraging their buying power to obtain favorable pricing. The resulting decrease in our prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWhen our information systems (or third-party systems we rely on) are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, are subject to cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of time or unauthorized access is obtained to a Customer\u2019s or their Client\u2019s data, we may incur significant liabilities, our service may be perceived as not being secure, Customers may curtail or stop using our products or services and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe services we offer involve the maintenance of our Customers\u2019 and Animal Owners sensitive information. In addition, we rely on information systems (\u201cIS\u201d) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, manage, and store data to, among other things:\n\u2022Maintain and manage systems to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers,\n\u2022Receive, process and ship orders on a timely basis,\n\u2022Manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of Customers, and\n\u2022Process payments to suppliers\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years, and a third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or other events that bypass our IS security systems causing an IS security breach may lead to a material disruption of our IS business systems and the loss of business, customer or client information resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, IS security systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.\nIn addition, we develop products and provide services to our Customers that are technology-based, and a cyberattack that bypasses the IS security systems of our products or services causing a security breach and perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or services could also cause significant reputational harm, and actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us by our Customers, their clients and governmental agencies. Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our Customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our Customers, their clients and governmental agencies and involve fines and penalties, costs for remediation, and substantial defense and settlement expenses.\nAdditionally, changes in the legislative or regulatory action related to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement new technology-based products and services. In addition, changes in the regulatory environment could increase our compliance related costs.\nRisks associated with these and other actual or perceived IS security breaches may include, among other things:\n\u2022The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property,\n\u2022Operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of information systems and subsequent clean-up and mitigation activities,\n\u2022The need to continually evolve procedures and safeguards to meet new IS challenges, and enhancing protections, and conducting investigations and remediation, may impose additional costs on us,\n\u2022Claims, fines and penalties, and costs for remediation, or substantial defense and settlement expenses, and\n\u2022Negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our Customers or Animal Owners, suppliers or industry peers or the loss of sales or Customers\nCovetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 23\nWe store, process and use information collected from or about our Customers and Animal Owners that subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens and may expose us to liability and potential objections from such Customers and Animal Owners, and our actual or perceived failure to adequately protect or appropriately use data could harm our brand, our reputation in the marketplace and our business.\nBecause we collect, store, process and use data, some of which contains personal information, we are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and other matters related to personal information. Failure to abide by these laws, regulations and standards could expose us to breach of contract claims, investigations, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation. Our Customers and Animal Owners may also object to or opt out of the collection and use of their data, which may harm our business.\nCertain states in which we operate, including California, and countries outside of the United States have adopted or may in the future adopt new regulations governing handling, storage, use and protection of personal information. The California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) is a state statute intended to enhance privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California, U.S. Both in the United States and abroad, these laws and regulations continue to evolve and remain subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain. If we fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could be required to make significant changes to our products or services, or incur substantial fines, penalties, or other liabilities. For example, if legislation or regulations are adopted, interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with our current business practices and that require changes to these practices, the design of our products and services or privacy practices, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, new or existing laws or regulatory actions may prevent us from selling our products or services, or increase the costs of doing so, and may affect our ability to invest in or develop products or services. In addition, a determination by a court or government agency that any of our practices do not meet these standards could result in liability or negative publicity and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted the EU General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) effective from May 25, 2018, which increases privacy rights for individuals in Europe, extends the scope or responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies offering goods or services to individuals who are located in Europe, or Data Subjects, or monitoring the behavior of such individuals (including by companies based outside of Europe). Noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of EUR 20 million, or 4% of total company revenues. Individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties as they relate to certain things such as employee personal data. Among other things, the GDPR requires, with respect to personal data concerning Data Subjects, company accountability, consents from Data Subjects or other acceptable legal basis needed to process the personal data, prompt breach notifications within 72 hours, fairness and transparency in how the personal data is stored, used or otherwise processed, and data integrity and security, and provides rights to Data Subjects relating to modification, erasure and transporting of the personal data. Our efforts to implement programs and controls that comply with the GDPR are likely to impose additional costs on us, and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements, or changes in our products or services in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements, will be accepted as compliant by applicable regulatory authorities.\nSuccessful claims for misappropriation or release of confidential or personal data brought against us or fines or other penalties assessed or any claim that results in significant adverse publicity against us could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nWe may launch branding or rebranding initiatives that may involve substantial costs and may not be favorably received by Customers.\nWe now operate under the name \u201cCovetrus, Inc.\u201d In connection with this name change, we have incurred substantial costs, and may in the future incur substantial additional costs, in rebranding our products and services, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain brand name recognition or status under the new brand that is comparable to the recognition and status previously enjoyed by the Animal Health Business, Vets First Choice or any of our local brand name operations globally. The failure of any such rebranding initiative could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers, which could cause us not to realize some or all the benefits contemplated by us as a result of our acquisition of Vets First Choice in an all-stock transaction (\u201cMerger\u201d).\nCovetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 24\nMany of our Customers are small and medium-sized businesses, which can be challenging to cost effectively reach, acquire, and retain.\nWe market and sell many of our services to veterinary practices and clinics, which are typically small or medium-sized business (\u201cSMBs\u201d). To grow our business, we must develop new customers, sell additional services to existing Customers, and encourage existing Customers to remain on our platform. However, selling to and retaining SMBs can be more difficult than selling to and retaining large enterprises because SMB customers:\n\u2022Are more price sensitive,\n\u2022Are more difficult to reach with broad marketing campaigns, and\n\u2022Often require higher sales, marketing and support expenditures by vendors that sell to them per revenue dollar generated for those vendors\nIf we are unable to cost effectively market and sell our services to our target customers, our ability to grow our business will be harmed.\nOur business is subject to risk based on global economic conditions.\nMacroeconomic, business, and financial disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Certain of our Customers, Animal Owners and our suppliers could be affected directly by an economic downturn, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and could face credit issues or cash flow problems that could give rise to payment delays, increased credit risk, bankruptcies and other financial hardships that could decrease the demand for our products or hinder our ability to collect amounts due from Customers. If one or more of our large Customers discontinue their relationship with us because of economic conditions or otherwise, our operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, our exposure to credit and collectability risk is higher in certain international markets and our ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. While we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit and collectability risk, there can be no assurances such procedures will effectively limit such risk and avoid losses. In addition, since Animal Owners typically utilize discretionary income to purchase services or products for their pets, economic concerns may cause some Animal Owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary practices or could reduce their willingness to treat pet health conditions or even to continue to own a pet.\nOur business is exposed to domestic and foreign currency fluctuations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nApproximately 45% of our Net sales for our business in fiscal 2020 was to Customers outside the United States. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact our sales, profits, assets, and liabilities. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable effects when the operating results of our non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars and could cause our results of operations to differ from our expectations and the expectations of our investors. For our international sales denominated in U.S. dollars, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products and services less competitive in international markets. Alternately, a weakening of the currencies in which transactional sales are generated relative to the currencies in which costs are denominated would decrease operating profits and cash flow. Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we purchase materials and services in foreign markets. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact our operating results. While we may use financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our cash flows, unhedged exposures would continue to be subject to currency fluctuations.\nThe future growth of our business depends in significant part on increasing our global sales. Our recent and continuing international expansion efforts subject us to additional risks.\nNet sales outside of the U.S. represented approximately 45% of our total Net sales in 2020, 47% in 2019, and 49% in 2018. Our international expansion efforts may be slow or unsuccessful to the extent we experience difficulties in recruiting, training, managing and retaining qualified personnel with international experience, language skills and cultural competencies in the geographic markets we target, which could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operation, and cash flow. Conducting and expanding international operations subjects us to risks we generally do not face in the U.S., including:\n\u2022Management, communication, and integration problems resulting from language barriers, cultural differences and geographic dispersion of our customers and personnel,\nCovetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 25\n\u2022Language translation of, and associated Customer Care support for, our products,\n\u2022Compliance with foreign laws, including laws regarding online disclaimers, advertising, liability of online service providers for activities of customers especially with respect to hosted content, and more stringent laws in foreign jurisdictions relating to consumer privacy and protection of data collected from individuals and other third parties,\n\u2022Accreditation and other regulatory requirements to do business and to provide domain name registration, web-hosting and other products in foreign jurisdictions,\n\u2022Greater difficulty in enforcing contracts, including our universal terms of service and other agreements,\n\u2022Increased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations,\n\u2022Greater costs and expenses associated with international marketing and operations,\n\u2022Greater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices, tariffs, trade disputes and tax laws and treaties,\n\u2022Different or lesser degrees of protection for our or our customers' intellectual property and free speech rights in certain markets,\n\u2022Increased exposure to foreign currency risks,\n\u2022Increased risk of a failure of employees to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including export and antitrust regulations, anti-bribery regulations and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices,\n\u2022Heightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies, and\n\u2022The potential for political, social, or economic unrest, terrorism, hostilities or war, and multiple and possibly overlapping tax regimes\nWe may require financing to fund our ongoing operations and capital expenditures, the availability of which is highly uncertain.\nThe capital and credit markets can experience volatility and disruption. Such markets can exert extreme downward pressure on stock prices and upward pressure on the cost of new debt capital and can severely restrict credit availability for most issuers. Our business will require expenditures to develop enhancements to our platforms, expand capacity, and add new businesses complementary to our product lines. In the future we may engage in transactions that depend on our ability to obtain financing. We may also seek financing to fund our ongoing operations.\nDepending on conditions in the financial markets and our financial performance, we may not be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to pursue our current and future spending programs, we may be forced to cancel or scale back those programs. Failure to successfully pursue our capital expenditure and other spending plans could negatively affect our ability to compete effectively and have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf a compounded drug formulation provided through our compounding pharmacy services leads to injury or death or results in a product recall, we may be exposed to liabilities or reputational harm.\nThe success of our compounding pharmacy services is dependent on perceptions of us and the safety and quality of our products and services. We could be adversely affected if we or any other compounding pharmacies or our formulations and technologies are subject to negative publicity. We could also be adversely affected if any of our formulations or technologies, any similar products sold by other companies, or any products sold by other veterinary compounding pharmacies prove to be, or are asserted to be, harmful. For instance, to the extent any of the components of approved drugs or other ingredients used to produce our compounded formulations have quality or other problems that adversely affect the finished compounded preparations, our business could be adversely affected. Also, because of our dependence on veterinarian and client perceptions, any adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from the use or misuse of our products, any similar products sold by other companies or any products sold by veterinary compounding pharmacies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAssertions by a third party that we are infringing its intellectual property, whether successful or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses.\nThe software and technology industries are characterized by the existence of many patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The preparation or sale of our products may infringe on the patent rights of others. As we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us may grow. Our technology may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use. Additionally, although we have licensed from other party's proprietary technology covered by patents, it cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. These types of claims could harm our relationships with our Customers, may deter future Customers from using our services or could expose us to litigation for such claims.\nCovetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 26\nAny intellectual property rights claim against us, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management attention and financial resources. An adverse determination also could prevent us from offering our services to Customers and may require the procurement or development of substitute services that do not infringe. As a result of intellectual property rights claims against us, we may have to pay damages or stop using technology or formulation found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights. We may have to seek a license for the intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and may significantly increase our operating expenses or may require us to restrict our business activities in one or more respects. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense.\nIn addition, we use open source software in our platform and will use open source software in the future. From time to time, we may face claims from companies that incorporate open source software into their products, claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, the open source software, or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional product, technology, and development resources to change our platform or services, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTurnover of key personnel, including executive officers, could disrupt our operations and our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business.\nOur success depends on the efforts of our executive officers and certain key personnel. Any unplanned turnover or our failure to develop an adequate succession plan for one or more of our executive officers or other key positions could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage. The loss or limited availability of the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key personnel, or our inability to recruit and retain qualified executive officers or other key personnel in the future, could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our future success also depends on our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented technical, managerial, sales, marketing, and service and support personnel. Competition for sales, marketing, and technology development personnel is particularly intense in the software and technology industries. As a result, we may be unable to successfully attract or retain qualified personnel, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and impair our ability to operate our business. We may incur substantial additional indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition.\nOn February 7, 2019, we entered into a $1.5 billion syndicated credit agreement with a group of lenders for a five-year term (the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d). The Credit Facilities include a $1.2 billion term loan facility, (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d), which was fully funded and primarily used to pay a dividend to Henry Schein, and a $300 million revolving line of credit for working capital and general corporate purposes (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, there was $1.1 billion outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and there were no borrowings from the Revolving Credit Facility, although we do utilize the Revolving Credit Facility from time to time.\nWe may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, including secured indebtedness. Although the agreements governing our Credit Facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.\nOur current level of indebtedness, and any additional indebtedness, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including the following:\n\u2022Limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing needed for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes,\n\u2022Requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to payments on our indebtedness instead of other purposes, including working capital needs, funding capital expenditures and pursuing future business opportunities,\n\u2022Limiting our ability to make continuous improvements to our business model and adjust to changing market conditions that may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt, and\nCovetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 27\n\u2022Increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business\nThe agreements governing our Credit Facilities contain restrictive covenants, which restrict our operational flexibility.\nThe agreements governing our Credit Facilities contain restrictions and limitations on our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests, including financial and other restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to:\n\u2022Incur additional indebtedness,\n\u2022Make dividends and other restricted payments,\n\u2022Incur additional liens,\n\u2022Consolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all assets,\n\u2022Make investments,\n\u2022Transfer or sell assets,\n\u2022Enter into restrictive agreements,\n\u2022Change the nature of the business, and\n\u2022Enter certain transactions with affiliates\nThe agreements governing our Credit Facilities also contain other restrictions customary for facilities of this nature.\nOur ability to borrow additional amounts or avoid acceleration of borrowed amounts under these agreements will depend on satisfaction of these covenants, including two financial covenants: (i) a maximum consolidated net total leverage ratio and (ii) a minimum consolidated net interest coverage ratio. Events beyond our control could affect our ability to meet these covenants. Our failure to comply with obligations under these agreements may result in an event of default under those agreements. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.\nWe require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. Our ability to generate such cash depends on many factors, some beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, and to fund capital expenditures, will depend on our ability to generate cash. This ability, to a certain extent, is subject to economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We have substantial indebtedness with significant debt service requirements, and we may incur additional indebtedness that would lead to increased interest expense and require additional cash flows to fund. In addition, borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at variable interest rates. As of December 31, 2020, we maintained interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating $500 million, which are intended to fix a portion of future interest payments associated with our $1.1 billion variable-rate Term Loan Facility. These swap agreements expire July 31, 2021. Despite the presence of these derivative contracts, interest rate increases, and in some instances interest rate decreases, could result in larger debt service requirements. Such an increase in our debt service obligations would adversely affect our cash flows. We cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our Credit Facilities or any subsequent credit agreement, or that we can obtain alternative financing proceeds in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe debt service obligations under our Credit Facilities could also reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels.\nRisks Relating to Regulation and Governmental Action\nWe are subject to substantial regulation in our business and operations and failure to comply with, or material changes to such regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur pharmacy and supply chain businesses are impacted by federal and state laws and regulations governing, among other things: the purchase, distribution, management, compounding, dispensing, marketing and labeling of prescription drugs and related services; DEA and state regulation affecting the sale and distribution of controlled substances; and statutes and regulations related\nCovetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 28\nto the sale and marketing of animal drugs, pet food, insecticides and devices. Our failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could severely limit or curtail our pharmacy and supply chain operations, which would materially harm our business and prospects. Our business could be affected by changes in these or any newly enacted laws and regulations, as well as federal and state agency interpretations of such statutes and regulations. Such statutory or regulatory changes could require that we make changes to our business model and operations and could require that we incur significantly increased costs to comply with such regulations. Further, we are required to comply with the laws of, and regulations promulgated by, various states, including the pharmacy boards of such states. State pharmacy boards regulate the dispensing and marketing of our pharmaceutical products and may take action, including fines, against companies for violations of their rules and regulations.\nThe status of compounded animal drugs is uncertain. The FDA issued proposed guidance titled Guidance for Industry #256: Compounding Animal Drugs from Bulk Drug Substances (\u201cGFI #256\u201d) on November 18, 2019. The comment period for this proposed guidance ended on October 15, 2020. If adopted, GFI #256 would strictly limit the circumstances under which the FDA would permit compounding of veterinary drug products. It is uncertain whether GFI #256 will be adopted in the form proposed, or at all. The proposed guidance is similar to guidance proposed by the FDA in 2015 and ultimately withdrawn in November 2017. These and other restrictions that may be imposed on the activities of compounding pharmacies may limit the available market for compounded formulations from bulk substances for animal use, as compared to the market available for the FDA-approved animal drugs.\nThe marketing and sale of compounded formulations is subject to and must comply with state statutes and regulations governing compounding pharmacies. These statutes and regulations include, among other things, restrictions on compounding in advance of receiving an animal-specific prescription, restrictions on compounding drugs that are essentially copies of FDA-approved drugs, restrictions on compounding drug products for office use, and restrictions on wholesaling. These and other restrictions on the activities of compounding pharmacies may significantly limit the market available for compounded formulations, as compared to the market available for FDA-approved drugs.\nLegislation may be proposed in the United States or other jurisdictions in the future that could impact the distribution channels for our companion animal products. For example, such legislation may require veterinarians to provide Animal Owners with written prescriptions and disclosure that the Animal Owner may fill prescriptions through a third party, which may further reduce the number of Animal Owners who purchase their animal-health products directly from veterinarians. Such requirements may lead to increased use of generic alternatives to our products or the increased substitution of our products with other animal-health products or human health products if such other products are deemed to be lower-cost alternatives. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe sale and distribution of our products is also regulated in most or all jurisdictions outside the United States where our business operates. Local regulations on sale and distribution may be tightened, for example regarding labeling, quality, or transportation, which may increase our costs of doing business. In the European Union, a revision of the current legislation on veterinary medicinal products is under way, establishing a new EU regulation on veterinary medicinal products will become effective January 28, 2022 throughout the European Union and will limit the use of antibiotics, tighten importation rules, and impose stricter pharmacovigilance standards. This regulation must still be implemented at the member state level and as such, additional requirements may be adopted by individual member states which would have the effect of increasing the compliance requirements for our business in the European Union with resulting costs.\nA significant portion of our operations is conducted in foreign jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, legal, regulatory, and business environments of the countries in which we do business. Risks associated with such international operations could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have significant operations outside of the United States. We expect that we will continue to expand our international operations in the future. International operations inherently subject us to several risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022Compliance with governmental controls, trade restrictions, restrictions on direct investments, quotas, embargoes, import and export restrictions, tariffs, duties, and regulatory and licensing requirements by domestic or foreign entities, including restrictions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.K. Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, United Nations Security Council, and Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade,\n\u2022Difficulties in building, staffing, and managing foreign operations (including a geographically dispersed workforce) and maintaining compliance with foreign labor laws,\n\u2022Burdens to comply with, and different levels of protection offered by, multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental, health and safety requirements and intellectual property,\nCovetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 29\n\u2022Changes in laws, regulations, government controls or enforcement practices with respect to our business and the businesses of our Customers,\n\u2022Political and social instability, including crime, civil disturbance, terrorist activities, armed conflicts, outbreak of disease, and natural and other disasters,\n\u2022Ongoing instability or changes in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s regulatory, economic, or political conditions, including as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s leaving the European Union, or Brexit, and any other similar referenda or actions by other European Union member countries,\n\u2022Local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices prohibited by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption laws and regulations,\n\u2022Longer payment cycles and increased exposure to counterparty risk,\n\u2022Disruptions in transportation of our products or our supply chain, and\n\u2022The differing product and service needs of foreign Customers.\nThe multinational nature of our business subjects us to potential risks that various taxing authorities may challenge the pricing of our cross-border arrangements and subject us to additional tax, adversely impacting our effective tax rate and our tax liability. In addition, international transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs. Compliance with these requirements may prohibit the import or export of certain products and technologies or may require us to obtain a license before importing or exporting certain products or technology. A failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations or requirements could result in civil or criminal legal proceedings, monetary or non-monetary penalties, or both, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services, and damage to our reputation. While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any of them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in any of these laws, regulations or requirements, or the political environment in a particular country, may affect our ability to engage in business transactions in certain markets, including investment, procurement, and repatriation of earnings.\nBrexit may have a negative effect on our business.\nThe uncertainty regarding new or modified arrangements between the United Kingdom and other countries following Brexit may have a material adverse effect on the movement of products between the United Kingdom and members of the European Union and the United States, including the interruption of or delays in imports into the United Kingdom of products originating within the European Union and exports from the United Kingdom of products originating there. Such a situation could have an adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur future effective income tax rates could be unfavorably affected by various factors including, among others, changes in the tax rates, rules and regulations in jurisdictions in which we generate income. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, our future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments.\nRisks Relating to the Transactions\nWe may not realize the anticipated revenue growth opportunities and operational synergies from the Transactions.\nThe benefits that we expect to achieve because of the Transactions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated revenue growth opportunities and operational synergies. Our success in realizing these revenue growth opportunities and operational synergies, and the timing of their realization, depends on the successful integration of the Animal Health Business and the business of Vets First Choice. Even if we can integrate the businesses successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the revenue growth and operational synergies that we currently expect within the anticipated time frame or at all. For example, we may not be able to accelerate the adoption of the Vets First Choice platform by the Animal Health Business\u2019 customers. Moreover, we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of the two businesses. Such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates. Accordingly, the benefits from the Transactions may be offset by costs or delays incurred in integrating the businesses.\nThe on-going integration of the Animal Health Business and Vets First Choice presents significant challenges that may lead to unforeseen business interruptions or substantial costs.\nCovetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 30\nThere is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating the Animal Health Business and the Vets First Choice business. These difficulties include, among others:\n\u2022The challenge of integrating the businesses while carrying on the ongoing operations of each business,\n\u2022The challenge of integrating the cultures of each business,\n\u2022The challenge of integrating the information technology systems of each business, and\n\u2022The potential difficulty in attracting and retaining key employees and sales personnel of each business\nThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of the businesses and may require us to incur substantial costs. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable time and attention to this integration process, which will decrease the time and attention they will have to manage our operations, service existing Customers, attract new Customers and develop new products, services or strategies. If senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted because of the integration process, our business could suffer. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully or cost-effectively integrate the Animal Health Business and Vets First Choice businesses. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may continue to incur costs associated with the Transactions that could affect our period-to-period operating results.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to incur significant one-time non-recurring costs over the next several years as a result of the Transactions. We may not be able to quantify the exact amount of these costs or the period in which they will be incurred. Some of the factors affecting the costs associated with the Transactions include the resources required in integrating the Animal Health Business and the Vets First Choice businesses. The amount and timing of these charges, including those related to information technology infrastructure and systems integration and planning, could adversely affect our period-to-period operating results, which could result in a reduction in the market price of shares of our common stock. Moreover, delays in completing the integration may reduce the growth opportunities and operational synergies and other benefits expected from the Transactions and such reduction may be material.\nWe may be unable to access equivalent benefits and services that historically have been provided by Henry Schein to the Animal Health Business.\nThe Animal Health Business previously received benefits and services from Henry Schein and benefited from Henry Schein\u2019s financial strength and extensive business relationships. We no longer benefit from Henry Schein\u2019s resources and it cannot be assured that we will be able to adequately replace all of the resources provided by Henry Schein or replicate them at the same cost. If we are not able to replace the resources provided by Henry Schein, or at the same cost there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be affected by significant restrictions imposed on us to avoid significant tax-related liabilities and related indemnification obligations.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement, dated as of January 7, 2019, by and among Henry Schein, Covetrus, Vets First Choice and the Vets First Choice Stockholders\u2019 Representative (as it may be amended and restated from time to time), (the \u201cTax Matters Agreement\u201d), generally prohibits us from taking certain actions that could cause the Distribution and the Merger to fail to qualify as tax-free transactions.\nIf the Distribution does not qualify as a tax-free spin-off under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code, we may have certain indemnification obligations which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Transactions were conditioned on Henry Schein\u2019s and our receipt of the Spin-off Tax Opinion. The parties did not obtain a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) with respect to the Transactions, and instead intend to rely solely on the Spin-off Tax Opinion for comfort that the spin-off and certain related transactions qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The Spin-off Tax Opinion is based on, among other things, certain representations, and assumptions as to factual matters, as well as certain undertakings, made by us. The failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true, correct, and complete in all material respects, or any undertakings to be fully complied with, could affect the validity of the Spin-off Tax Opinion. An opinion of counsel represents counsel\u2019s best legal judgment, is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree with the conclusions set forth in the Spin-off Tax Opinion. In addition, the Spin-off Tax Opinion was based on current law, and cannot be relied on if current law changes with retroactive effect.\nCovetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 31\nIf the Transactions do not qualify for their intended tax-free treatment, we may have an obligation under the Tax Matters Agreement to indemnify Henry Schein for the resulting tax liability (which may be significant). In the event we are required to indemnify Henry Schein for taxes incurred in connection with the Transactions, the indemnification obligation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDue to the Merger, our ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be restricted and these net operating losses could expire or otherwise be unavailable.\nDue to the Merger, our ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income will be further restricted and these net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) could expire or otherwise be unavailable. In general, under Section 382 of the Code and corresponding provisions of state law, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. For these purposes, an ownership change generally occurs where the aggregate stock ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who owns at least 5% of a corporation\u2019s stock increases its ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a specified testing period. Prior to the Merger, some of Vets First Choice\u2019s existing NOLs were subject to limitations. Following the Merger, Vets First Choice\u2019s existing NOLs may be subject to further limitations and we may not be able to fully use these NOLs to offset future taxable income. In addition, if we undergo any subsequent ownership change, our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited. There is also a risk that, due to regulatory changes or for other unforeseen reasons, existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) resulted in a reduction in the economic benefit of the NOLs and other deferred tax assets available to us. Under the Tax Act, U.S. federal NOLs generated after December 31, 2017 will not be subject to expiration.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations, and you may be unable to resell your shares at or above the price at which you acquired them, or at all.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022Quarterly variations in our revenues and operating expenses,\n\u2022Developments in the financial markets and worldwide or regional economies,\n\u2022Announcements of innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors,\n\u2022Announcements by the government relating to regulations that govern our industry,\n\u2022Significant sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market,\n\u2022Variations in interest rates,\n\u2022Changes in the market valuations of other comparable companies, and\n\u2022Changes in accounting principles\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by a negative outcome in significant litigation or other legal proceedings.\nWe are currently involved in a shareholder securities litigation, and may be subject to future litigation matters, claims, and demands. These matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution or outcome of any of these lawsuits, claims, demands or investigations could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our ability to report our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows accurately and on a timely basis and could harm our reputation.\nAs a publicly traded company, we are subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d). The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nCovetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 32\nTo comply with these requirements, we have and will need to continue to upgrade and implement additional internal controls, reporting systems, information technology systems and procedures, and hire additional accounting, legal, compliance, and finance staff. A material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that results in a more than reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2019, management identified a material weakness in our internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls (ITGC\u2019s) in the areas of logical security and change management in certain of our business units within North America, APAC, and Europe. As a result of this material weakness, management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of September 30, 2019 and through December 31, 2019.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2019, management identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting relating to our accounting for income taxes. Management's assessment identified control deficiencies associated with the transition to establishing expanded in-house tax capabilities and utilizing new tax consultants. As a result of these issues, our controls to review and analyze the Company's income tax provision and deferred income tax balances did not operate effectively. That led management to conclude that the control deficiencies that existed at December 31, 2019 represented a material weakness in internal controls.\nWe implemented remedial measures to address the material weaknesses prior to the end of fiscal 2020, however we cannot ensure that our efforts have been successful, or that we have identified all material weaknesses. Our remedial measures may result in additional technology and other expenses. Any failure to implement these remedial measures and to achieve and maintain effective internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the market for our common stock.\nFor a discussion of our internal controls over financial reporting and a description of the identified material weakness, see Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of this Report.\nSales of our common stock may negatively affect its market price.\nIt is likely that some stockholders have sold or may sell our common stock received in the Transactions for various reasons such as if our business profile or market capitalization as a combined company does not fit their investment objectives. Certain of these shares were not restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act after the expiration of the lock-up period and, unless held by our affiliates, may subsequently be sold into the public market without restriction The sales of significant amounts of our common stock or the perception in the market that this will occur may result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nUnder our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our non-employee directors generally have no obligation to offer us corporate opportunities.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation addresses potential conflicts of interest with respect to corporate opportunities and transactions that are presented to, or which otherwise come into the possession of, any of our directors who is not also one of our employees or an employee of any of our subsidiaries. Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we renounce any interest or expectancy in such corporate opportunities unless they were presented to a non-employee director expressly and solely in such person\u2019s capacity as one of our directors.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws could discourage, delay, or prevent a change of control and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. For example, the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, collectively:\n\u2022Authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board without approval of stockholders,\n\u2022For the first three years following the Merger until the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, divide our Board into three classes, serving staggered terms of one, two and three years, respectively,\nCovetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 33\n\u2022Limit the ability of stockholders to remove directors by requiring the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our capital stock then entitled to vote for removal and, until the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, permitting directors to be removed only with cause,\n\u2022Provide that vacancies on our Board may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office,\n\u2022Prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders,\n\u2022Prohibit stockholder action by written consent,\n\u2022Establish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of candidates for election as directors before an annual or special meeting of our stockholders or to bring other business before an annual meeting of our stockholders,\n\u2022Subject us to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\"DGCL\"), which will prohibit us from engaging in business combinations with certain \u201cinterested stockholders\u201d for three years following the date such stockholder became interested unless certain criteria are met, and\n\u2022Require the approval of holders of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of our capital stock then entitled to vote to amend the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the amended and restated by-laws.\nThese provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of the common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. The amended and restated by-laws also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove management by giving our Board the sole ability to elect and remove officers. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of the stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware or other state courts of the State of Delaware (each such court, as applicable, the \u201cSelected Forum\u201d), as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Selected Forum will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our current or former directors, officers, employees or stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated by-laws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on a Selected Forum, (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, (v) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated by-laws, or (vi) any other action asserting an \u201cinternal corporate claim\u201d under Section 115 of the DGCL. If a stockholder files any of the preceding actions in a court other than a court located within the State of Delaware (a \u201cForeign Action\u201d), such stockholder shall be deemed to have consented to (x) the personal jurisdiction of the Selected Forum in connection with any action brought in such court to enforce the choice of forum provision and (y) having service of process made on such stockholder in any such enforcement action by service on the stockholder\u2019s counsel (as such stockholder\u2019s agent) in the foreign action. By becoming a holder of our common stock, a person will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf securities or industry analysts publish unfavorable research about us or cease to provide coverage of us, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us and our business. If one or more of the securities and industry analysts who cover our stock downgrades the stock or publishes unfavorable research about us, the stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause the stock price or trading volume to decline.\nFluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future, due to a number of factors, including: seasonality of certain product lines; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; changes in our accounting estimates; timing of operating expenditures; and timing of regulatory approvals and licenses, which could adversely impact the value of our common\nCovetrus, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 34\nstock. Furthermore, our results may fluctuate due to a variety of other factors, many of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict.\nThe cumulative effects of these factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Investors should not rely on past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failure to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if any forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially, which may also indicate that our remaining goodwill is potentially impaired. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated revenue and earnings guidance we may provide.", "PERMNO": 18327, "SIC": 5912, "TIC": "CVET"}
