If we lose any of these customers, our revenue could decline significantly.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and dynamic marketplace in which current and prospective customers often seek to lower their costs through a competitive bidding process among EMS providers. This creates an opportunity to increase revenue to the extent we are successful in the bidding process, but there is also the potential for revenue to significantly decline to the extent we are unsuccessful in the competitive bidding process. Furthermore, even if we are successful, there is the potential for our margins to decrease if we are required to lower our prices in order to win such bids.\nOur largest customer and 10 largest customers represented 12.8% and 52.8%, 10.9% and 68.1%, and 11.9% and 72.5%, respectively, of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2019, December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our revenue. In addition to having a relatively limited number of customers, we manufacture a relatively limited number of products for each of our customers. If we lose any of our largest customers (as we have in the past from time to time), experience a significant reduction in sales to any such customers or no longer manufacture a particular product line for one of our largest customers, we would experience a significant reduction in our revenue. Further, we make no assurance that our largest customers will continue to have us manufacture their products from us at current or historical levels. Moreover, we typically do not enter into long-term volume purchase contracts with our customers, and our customers have certain rights to extend or delay the shipment of their orders. We, however, typically require that our customers contractually agree to buy back inventory purchased within specified lead times to build their products if not used. See also \u201cOur customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations, or delay production, and the inherent difficulties involved in responding to these demands could harm our business.\u201d In addition, because of the concentration in our customer base, we have significant amounts of trade accounts receivable from some of our customers and the insolvency of one or more of our largest customers or the inability of one or more of our largest customers to pay for its orders would decrease our revenue significantly. A reduction in revenue could decrease our profitability, cash flow and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, the success of our business depends, in part, on the continued growth and financial stability of our customers, including, in particular, our largest customers. Adverse changes in the end markets these customers serve could reduce demand from our customers in those markets and/or cause customers in such end markets to be more price sensitive, which could cause us to lose sales or require us to lower prices and thereby suffer a decrease in our margins. Further, mergers, acquisitions, restructuring or other consolidations among our customers, or their end customers, could intensify our customer concentration or reduce total demand as the combined entities reevaluate their business and consolidate their suppliers, which could materially and adversely affect our business. In the event of consolidation among our customers, depending on which of the entities involved in the consolidation controls the combined company\u2019s supply chain function following the consolidation, we may not be retained as a preferred or approved manufacturer. In addition, product duplication could result in the termination of a product line that we currently manufacture. While there is also the potential to increase our sales to the combined customer, our revenues could decrease if we are not retained as a continuing supplier. Even if we are retained as a supplier, we may face the risk of increased pricing pressure from the combined customer because of its increased market share and purchasing power.\nAs a manufacturer, we are particularly exposed to general economic conditions, which could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAs a result of unfavorable economic conditions, reduced capital spending and changes in our customers\u2019 manufacturing requirements, our revenues could experience significant declines in the future. If general economic conditions deteriorate, including the onset of a global economic recession, other uncertainty in the global economy such as unstable global financial and credit markets or increased inflation and tariffs, we may experience an adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition, since end customer demand for our customers\u2019 products could be adversely affected. Due to the current uncertainty surrounding the economy and our ability to predict the effect such conditions will have on its customers, we cannot predict the scope or magnitude of the negative effect that any economic slowdown may have on our business. Further, economic and financial market conditions that adversely affect our customers may cause them to terminate or delay existing purchase orders or to reduce the volume of products they purchase from us in the future. We may have significant accounts receivable outstanding from customers, including our largest customers, that operate in cyclical industries and under leveraged conditions, which could impair their ability to pay amounts owed to us on a timely basis. Our failure to collect a significant portion of those receivables could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. See \u201c-A majority of our revenue comes from a relatively small number of customers. If we lose any of these customers, our revenue could decline significantly.\u201d\nSimilarly, adverse changes in credit terms extended to us by our suppliers, such as shortening the required payment period for outstanding accounts payable or reducing the maximum amount of trade credit extended to us, could negatively and significantly affect our liquidity and thereby have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and financial market conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for, and respond to, those changes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur supply chain in China may be materially adversely impacted due to the recent coronavirus outbreak.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus began to impact the population of Wuhan, China. We rely upon the facilities of our suppliers in China to support our business as well as to export components throughout the world. As of December 29, 2019, we sourced components from approximately 137 suppliers located throughout China and approximately 40% of the components in our global supply chain were sourced from our suppliers in China during the year ended December 29, 2019. The outbreak has resulted in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus, including, among others, restrictions on manufacturing and the movement of employees in many regions of the country. As a result of the coronavirus and the measures designed to contain the spread of the virus, our suppliers may not have the materials, capacity, or capability to supply our components according to our schedule and specifications. Any reduction in production capacity or supply capacity at factories in China may reduce or even halt the supply of finished goods and necessary components for many of our customers\u2019 products, which could result in product shortages and an increase in our inventory of unfinished products. Further, there may be logistics issues, including our ability and our supply chain\u2019s ability to quickly ramp up production, and transportation demands that may cause further delays. If our suppliers\u2019 operations are curtailed, we may need to seek alternate sources of supply, which may be more expensive. Alternate sources may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to us from our supply chain and subsequently to our customers, each of which would affect our results of operations. While the disruptions and restrictions on the ability to travel, quarantines, and temporary closures of the facilities of our suppliers, as well as general limitations on movement in the region are expected to be temporary, the duration of the production and supply chain disruption, and related financial impact, cannot be estimated at this time. Should the production and distribution closures continue for an extended period of time, the impact on our supply chain in China and globally could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. See \u201c-We depend on a limited number of suppliers for components that are critical to our manufacturing processes and shortages or price fluctuations of component parts specified by our customers could delay product shipment and affect our profitability.\u201d The coronavirus outbreak could also delay our release or delivery of our or our customers\u2019 new or product offerings or require us or our customers to make unexpected changes to such offerings, which may materially adversely affect our business and operating results. Our operating results could also continue to be adversely affected to the extent that the coronavirus outbreak harms the Chinese economy in general. In addition, the coronavirus outbreak could evolve into a worldwide health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and our customers\u2019 products and materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currencies against the U.S. dollar, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nAs a global company, we have significant costs, primarily payroll denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of our sales and component purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. Our Canadian, Mexican and Asian payroll, Euro based component purchases and other various expenses are denominated in local currencies. A decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could result in lower revenues, product price pressures, and increased losses from currency exchange rates. As a result, we may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange currency rate fluctuations related to the forecasted Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. We have decided at this time not to hedge exposure due to foreign exchange currency related to EURO components purchases or Asian payroll. To the extent we are not able to effectively manage this exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur industry is very competitive and we may not be successful if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe EMS industry is highly competitive. We compete against numerous large domestic and foreign EMS providers but consider our peer group and direct competitors to be IEC Electronics Corp., Key Tronic Corp., Nortech Systems Inc., Sigmatron International Inc., and Sypris Solutions Inc. We may in the future encounter competition from additional large electronics manufacturers that are selling, or may begin to sell, electronics manufacturing services. Some of our competitors have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development and marketing resources and lower cost structures than us. We also face competition from the manufacturing operations of current and potential customers, which are continually evaluating the merits of manufacturing products internally compared to the advantages of using external manufacturers such as us.\nFurthermore, larger EMS providers who have greater direct buying power from component suppliers, distributors and raw material suppliers or who have lower cost structures as a result of their geographic location may operate more efficiently than us. As a result, other EMS providers with significant purchasing and marketing power may have a competitive advantage over us. Our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to meaningful proprietary protection, and companies with greater resources, financial or otherwise, or a greater market presence may enter our market or increase their competition with us. As a result, our competitors could copy our non-proprietary designs and processes after we have invested in development of products for customers, which could allow those competitors to offer customers lower prices on such products. We also expect that our competitors will continue to improve the performance of their current products or services, to reduce the prices of their products or services and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater performance and lower prices. Any of the foregoing could cause our sales to decline, a decrease in our profit margin or a loss of market share.\nIn addition, increased pressure to limit U.S. defense spending and changes in the U.S. government procurement environment may limit certain future market opportunities for us. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense (the \u201cDoD\u201d) increasingly is committed to awarding contracts through competitive bidding and relying on competitive contract award types. See \u201c-Our financial results depend, in part, on our ability to perform on our U.S. government contracts, and changes in government defense spending and priorities could have consequences on our financial position, results of operations and business.\u201d\nIf we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors in our core markets, we may experience declines in revenues and market share which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nWe experience variability in our operating results, which could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock.\nOur annual and quarterly results have fluctuated in the past. The reasons for these fluctuations may similarly impact our business in the future. You should not rely solely on our results of operations in any past period to indicate what our results will be for any future period. Our operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nvariations in the timing and volume of customer orders relative to our manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022\nintroduction and market acceptance of our customers\u2019 new products;\n\u2022\nchanges in demand or market acceptance for our customers\u2019 existing or new products;\n\u2022\nthe accuracy of our customers\u2019 forecasts of future production requirements;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers and customer or product attrition;\n\u2022\neffectiveness in managing our manufacturing processes, inventory levels and costs;\n\u2022\nour level of experience in manufacturing a particular product;\n\u2022\nchanges in competitive and economic conditions generally or in our customers\u2019 end markets;\n\u2022\nprice competition;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters that may impede our operations, the operation of our customers\u2019 business, or availability of manufacturing inputs from our suppliers;\n\u2022\nfailure or external breach of our information technology systems;\n\u2022\nwillingness of suppliers to supply the Company on normal credit terms; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the cost, or availability, of components or skilled labor.\nIn addition, most of our customers typically do not commit to firm production schedules more than 30 to 90 days in advance. Accordingly, it is difficult for us to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty. As a result, we may not be able to schedule production to maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity. In the past, we have been required to increase staffing, purchase materials and incur other expenses to meet the demand of our customers. Sometimes anticipated orders from customers have failed to materialize and, at times, delivery schedules have been deferred as a result of changes in a customer\u2019s needs. Any material delay, cancellation or reduction of orders from our larger customers could cause our revenue to decline. In addition, a reduction in customer demand may decrease our gross margins and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. On other occasions, customers have required rapid and unexpected increases in production, which have placed burdens on our manufacturing capacity and supply chain function and adversely affected costs. See \u201c-If we are unable to maintain satisfactory utilization rates at our manufacturing factories, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\u201d\nThe EMS industry is affected by the United States and global economies, both of which are influenced by world events. An economic slowdown, particularly in the industries we serve, may result in our customers reducing their forecasts or delaying orders. The demand for our services could weaken, which in turn could substantially influence our sales, capacity utilization, margins and financial results. Results for any one quarter or year are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. This could lead to results outside of analyst and investor expectations, which could increase volatility of our stock price.\nAny of these factors or a combination of these factors could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon the industry sectors we service, which produce electronic products that are technologically advanced with short life cycles, and our business could be negatively impacted by economic slowdowns in these sectors.\nMost of our customers develop technologically advanced electronic products, which are characterized by intense competition, short product life cycles and significant fluctuations in product demand. In addition, these products are generally subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence. If our customers are unable to create products that keep pace with the changing technological environment, their products could become obsolete and, in turn, the demand for our manufacturing services could significantly decline. Our success is largely dependent on the success achieved by our customers in developing and marketing their products. Furthermore, the electronics industry is subject to economic cycles and has, in the past, experienced downturns. A decline in the industry demand for these products would likely have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe make no assurance that our customers will continue to buy products from us at current levels, that we will retain any or all of our existing customers or that we will be able to form new relationships with customers upon the loss of one or more of our existing customers in this market. Any material reduction in sales, consolidation or slowdowns in the industry sectors we service could have a negative impact on our business and financial results.\nConsolidation in the industry sectors in which we operate in may adversely affect our business by increasing customer buying power or increasing competition.\nConsolidation in the industry sectors in which we operate among our competitors, our customers, or both, may strengthen existing, large electronics companies or result in the formation of new large electronics companies. The significant buying and market power of these companies may increase competitive pressures on us, which could negatively impact our margins. In addition, if any of our large customers are acquired or merged, we may lose that customer\u2019s business, which would cause our sales to decline and would likely have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for components that are critical to our manufacturing processes and shortages or price fluctuations of component parts specified by our customers could delay product shipment and affect our profitability.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from turnkey manufacturing. In turnkey manufacturing, we provide both the materials and the manufacturing services. If we fail to manage our inventory effectively, we may bear the risk of fluctuations in materials costs, scrap and excess inventory, all of which can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, delays, cancellations or reductions of orders by our customers could result in an excess of materials. Orders received from customers within component lead time, rapid increases in orders or lengthening of lead times by suppliers could cause a shortage of materials. A shortage of materials could lengthen production schedules and increase costs. An excess of materials may increase the costs of maintaining inventory and may increase the risk of inventory obsolescence, both of which may increase expenses and decrease profit margins and operating income.\nMany of the products we manufacture require one or more components that we order from sole-source suppliers. Supply shortages for a particular component can delay production of all products using that component or cause cost increases in the services we provide. In addition, in the past, some of the materials we use, such as memory and logic devices, have been subject to industry-wide shortages. At such times, suppliers allocate available quantities among their customers, and we have not been able to obtain all of the materials required. Our inability to obtain these materials could slow production or assembly, delay shipments to our customers, increase costs and reduce operating income. Also, we may bear the risk of periodic component price increases, which if we are not able to recover from our customers, could reduce our operating income. In addition, we rely on a variety of common carriers for materials transportation, and we route materials through various world ports. A work stoppage, strike or shutdown of a major port or airport could result in manufacturing and shipping delays or expediting charges, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may encounter difficulties with acquisitions, including the risks associated with the integration of acquired businesses, such as MC Assembly, and divestitures, which could harm our business.\nWe have completed acquisitions of businesses in the past and we may acquire additional businesses in the future. Any future acquisitions may require additional equity financing, which could be dilutive to our existing shareholders, or additional debt financing, which could increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings. Any downgrades in our credit ratings associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow by resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms. As a result of the foregoing, we also may not be able to complete acquisitions or strategic customer transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past, or at all.\nTo integrate acquired businesses, such as MCA, we must implement our management information systems, operating systems and internal controls, and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations. The difficulties of this integration may be further complicated by geographic distances. The integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business. In addition, the integration of acquired businesses may require that we incur significant restructuring charges.\nUncertainty about integrations, such as MCA, may affect the relationship between us and our employees, clients and suppliers, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These uncertainties may cause clients, suppliers and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships and to delay or defer decisions concerning us. Changes to existing business relationships, including termination or modification, could negatively affect our revenues, earnings and cash flow, as well as the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, we are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our officers, key management personnel and other key employees to operate our business and execute our business plans. Our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following integrations, such as MCA, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees. Our business could be negatively impacted if key employees depart because of issues related to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration.\nAcquisitions involve numerous other risks and challenges, including:\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management's attention from the normal operation of our business;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in achieving target cost synergies of the new combined company;\n\u25cf\nfailure to implement our business plan for the combined business;\n\u25cf\npotential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties managing and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations;\n\u25cf\nthe potential for deficiencies in internal controls at acquired companies;\n\u25cf\nincreases in our expenses and working capital requirements, which reduce our return on invested capital;\n\u25cf\nlack of experience operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the acquired business;\n\u25cf\ncybersecurity and compliance related issues;\n\u25cf\ninitial dependence on unfamiliar supply chain or relatively small supply chain partners; and\n\u25cf\nexposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies.\nFurthermore, we may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that each of us and the acquired business had achieved or might achieve separately. The markets in which the acquired business operates may not experience the growth rates expected and any economic downturn affecting those markets could negatively impact such business. If the acquired business or the markets in which it operates deteriorate, the potential cost savings, growth opportunities and other synergies of the acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. In such case, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted.\nDivestitures involve significant risks, including without limitation, difficulty finding financially sufficient buyers or selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner, and the agreed-upon terms could be renegotiated due to changes in business or market conditions. Divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and, under certain circumstances, require us to record impairment charges or a loss as a result of the transaction. In addition, completing divestitures requires expenses and management attention and could leave us with certain continuing liabilities.\nThese and other factors have harmed, and in the future could harm, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition or divestiture, and could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf we are unable to respond to rapidly changing technology and process development, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe market for our services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing process development. The future success of our business will depend in large part upon our ability to hire and retain qualified engineering and technical personnel, maintain and enhance our technological capabilities, to develop and market manufacturing services that meet changing customer needs, and to successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis. In addition, the EMS industry could encounter competition from new or revised technologies in the future that render existing technology less competitive or obsolete or that reduce the demand for our services. We may not be able to effectively respond to the technological requirements of the changing market. To the extent we determine that new technologies and equipment are required to remain competitive, the development, acquisition and implementation of such technologies and equipment may require us to make significant capital investments. We may not be able to access capital for these purposes in the future and investments in new technologies may not result in commercially viable technological processes.\nDisruptions to our information technology systems, including cyber security incidents, losses of data or outages, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial results.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store information related to our business. In particular, we depend on our information technology systems for a variety of functions, including, but not limited to, financial reporting, inventory management, procurement, invoicing and email. We also have access to, and we create and store, sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, and personally identifiable information of our employees. Any of the foregoing may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, and similar events. Despite the implementation of network security measures, our systems and those of third parties on which we rely may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions. Such events could make it difficult to manufacture or deliver products to our customers due to our reliance on our systems in the day to day operations of our business. While we maintain security and back-up procedures to business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions. Any security breaches could compromise our networks and the information stored on them could be improperly accessed, disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, damage our reputation or our relationships with our customers or result in legal claims or proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, revenues and competitive position.\nIf the products we manufacture are defective, demand for our services may decline and we may be exposed to product liability and product warranty claims.\nDefects in the products we manufacture, whether caused by, among other things, a design, engineering, manufacturing or component failure or deficiencies in our manufacturing processes, could result in product or component failures, which may damage our business reputation and expose us to product liability or product warranty claims.\nIf a product or component we manufacture is found to cause any personal injury or property damage or is otherwise found to be defective, we could incur significant expenditures to resolve any potential claims resulting from such damages or defects. In addition, any such claim could hurt our reputation or position in the marketplace, which could result in the loss of existing customers or affect our ability to attract new customers. A successful product liability or product warranty claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough, generally, liability for these claims in our contracts rest with our customers, our customers may or may not have the resources to satisfy claims for costs or liabilities arising from a defective product or component for which they have assumed responsibility or they may be otherwise unwilling or unable to assume responsibility.\nWe depend on our key personnel and skilled employees and our business could suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel and skilled employees.\nOur business depends, in part, on our ability to continue to recruit, train and retain skilled employees, particularly executive management, engineering and sales personnel. Recruiting personnel in our industry is highly competitive. Our ability to successfully implement our business plan depends in part on our ability to attract and retain management and existing employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain, now or in the future, executive officers and other key personnel. In addition, if we receive a significant volume of new orders at any one time, we may have difficulty recruiting skilled workers to respond to such orders and accordingly may experience delays that could adversely affect our ability to meet customers\u2019 delivery schedules, which may impact those customers\u2019 decisions to place future orders with us.\nRisks particular to our international manufacturing operations and our operations as a global company could each adversely affect our overall results.\nOur international manufacturing operations are subject to inherent risks, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the value of currencies and high levels of inflation;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles relative to the U.S. and greater difficulty in collecting amounts receivable;\n\u2022\nreduced credit and payment terms with vendors;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in and the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\nterrorism or war, which can interrupt commerce;\n\u2022\nincreases in duties, trade restrictions, tariffs, import and export controls, taxation and other non-tariff barriers such as quotas and local content rules;\n\u2022\ndelays associated with the manufacture, transportation and delivery of products;\n\u2022\nincreased transportation costs due to distance, energy prices, or other factors\n\u2022\ndelays in the transportation and delivery of goods due to increased security concerns;\n\u2022\nrestrictions and potential penalties due to privacy laws, on the handling and transfer of consumer and other personal information;\n\u2022\npotential violations of U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws by our employees, business partners or agents, despite our policies and procedures relating to compliance with these laws;\n\u2022\nexpropriation and nationalization;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing foreign operations effectively and efficiently from the U.S.;\n\u2022\nchanges in international trade agreements and governmental policies and regulations;\n\u2022\nimposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds; and\n\u2022\nincreased accounting and internal control costs.\nIn fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, 68.4%, 84.4% and 84.9%, respectively, of our revenue was earned from products that we manufactured internationally (outside of the U.S.). As of the end of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, 47.1% and 46.9%, respectively, of our total consolidated assets were located internationally (outside of the U.S.). Changes to laws, regulations or trade agreements in relation to Mexico could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to customs laws and regulations with respect to our export and import activity which are complex and vary within legal jurisdictions in which we operate. We make no assurance that there will not be a control failure around customs enforcement despite the precautions we take. We are currently subject to audits by customs authorities. Any failure to comply with customs laws and regulations could be discovered during a U.S. or foreign government customs audit, or customs authorities may disagree with our tariff treatments, and such actions could result in substantial fines and penalties, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. In addition, changes to U.S. trade laws may adversely impact our operations. These changes and any changes to the trade laws of other countries may add additional compliance costs and obligations and subject us to significant fines and penalties for non-compliance. Compliance with these and other foreign legal regimes may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nFinally, as a global company, we are subject to foreign and U.S. laws and regulations designed to combat governmental corruption, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and a materially negative effect on our brand and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies.\nWe are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to the environment, health and safety and defense and our failure to comply with such current and future governmental regulations could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of our use of metals and other hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes, our operations are regulated under a number of federal, state, provincial, local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations which govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of such materials. In addition, we are subject to a variety of U.S. government regulations related to the export and import of defense-related articles and services, as well as federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to employee occupational health and safety. To date, the cost to us of such compliance has not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, violations may occur in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes within and outside of our control. We may be liable under environmental laws for the cost of cleaning up properties we own or operate if they are, or become, contaminated by the release of hazardous materials, regardless of whether we caused such release. In addition, we may be liable for costs associated with an investigation and remediation of sites at which we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes if such sites become contaminated, even if we fully comply with applicable environmental laws. In the event of a contamination or violation of environmental laws, we could be held liable for damages, including fines, penalties and the costs of remedial actions and could also be subject to revocation of our discharge permits. Any such revocations could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities, thereby having an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, environmental laws could also become more stringent over time, which would impose greater compliance costs and increase the risks and penalties associated with any violation, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of environmental legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed in the future, or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. Finally, any such current or future regulations could restrict our ability to expand our operations or could require us to acquire costly equipment, substitute materials, or incur other significant expenses to in order to attempt to comply with such regulations.\nOur customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations, or delay production, and the inherent difficulties involved in responding to these demands could harm our business.\nOur industry must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround for its customers. We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers and we continue to experience reduced lead-times in customer orders. Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities, delay production or change their sourcing strategy for a number of reasons. Such changes, delays and cancellations may lead to our production and possession of excess or obsolete inventory, which we may not be able to sell to the customer or a third party. The success of our customers\u2019 products in the market affects our business. Cancellations, reductions, delays or changes in sourcing strategy by a significant customer or by a group of customers could negatively impact our operating results by reducing the number of products that we sell, delaying the payment to us for inventory that we purchased and reducing the use of our manufacturing facilities, which have associated fixed costs not dependent on our level of revenue.\nIn addition, we make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimate of customer requirements. The short-term nature of our customers\u2019 commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to accurately estimate the future requirements of those customers. Our inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty can make it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity and manage inventory levels.\nOn occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which can stress our resources and reduce operating margins. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand can harm our gross profits and operating results. See \u201cOur supply chain in China may be materially adversely impacted due to the recent coronavirus outbreak\u201d, while our customers have not reduced or materially adjusted demand as a result of the Coronavirus outbreak, we have increased risk of servicing customer component demands with our supply chain in China, as a result of the Coronavirus outbreak.\nWe structure our agreements with customers to mitigate our risks related to obsolete or unsold inventory. However, enforcement of these contracts may result in material expense and delay in payment for inventory. If any of our significant customers become unable or unwilling to purchase such inventory, our business may be materially harmed.\nIf we are unable to maintain satisfactory utilization rates at our manufacturing factories, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nGiven the high fixed costs of our operations, decreases in utilization rates at our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business. Accordingly, our ability to maintain or enhance our margins continues to depend, in part, on maintaining satisfactory utilization rates. In turn, our ability to maintain satisfactory utilization depends on the demand for our products, the volume of orders we receive, and our ability to offer products that meet our customers\u2019 requirements at attractive prices. If current or future production capacity fails to match current or future customer demands, our facilities would be underutilized, our sales may not fully cover our high fixed overhead expenses, and we would be less likely to achieve our anticipated gross margins. Furthermore, if the forecasts and assumptions used to support the implied fair value of goodwill or recoverability of our long-lived assets including intangible assets change, we may incur significant impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, as we have experienced.\nIn addition, we generally schedule our production facilities at less than full capacity to retain our ability to respond to unexpected additional quick-turn orders. However, if these orders are not received, we may forego some production and could experience continued excess capacity. If we conclude that we have significant, long-term excess capacity, we may decide to permanently close one or more of our facilities and terminate some of our employees. See \u201c-We experience variability in our operating results, which could negatively impact the price of our shares.\u201d Facility closures or employee terminations could result in our recording restructuring charges such as severance and other exit costs, and asset impairments. See \u201c-Our restructuring activities will increase our expenses, may not be successful, and may adversely impact employee hiring and retention. Also, we have incurred other substantial restructuring charges in the past and we may continue to in the future.\u201d\nAny restructuring activities will increase our expenses, may not be successful, and may adversely impact employee hiring and retention. Also, we have incurred other substantial restructuring charges in the past and we may continue to in the future.\nIn September 2019, we announced our plans to close our Chinese manufacturing operation when our current Dongguan, China facility lease expired in December 2019, and extended to February 2020 as approved by our Board of Directors. The closure of the Dongguan manufacturing facility is intended to reduce the labor force, which impacted approximately 137 employees at the Dongguan manufacturing facility. The closure of the Dongguan facility will reduce forecasted losses that would have otherwise been incurred in fiscal year 2020 as the Dongguan facility was not expected to be fully utilized. We expect the wind down and closure of the Dongguan facility will be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of 2020, however there are still some continued deregistration and filing requirements to be made in 2020. Manufacturing of certain products previously manufactured at the Dongguan manufacturing facility were substantially transferred to our other manufacturing facilities.\nAs a result of the foregoing actions, we incurred corporate restructuring costs totaling approximately $5.0 million in 2019. These restructuring costs adversely impacted our results of operations during 2019. Additionally, the amount of the restructuring expenses we expect to incur in 2020, as well as our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our restructuring activities, are subject to assumptions and uncertainties. In addition, restructuring charges of $3.0 million were incurred related to the reduction of 47 full-time equivalents (\"FTEs\u201d) in the United States, 8 FTEs in Canada and 630 FTEs and contract employees in Mexico. There is no assurance that we will successfully implement or fully realize the anticipated benefits of our restructuring activities. If we fail to realize the anticipated benefits from these measures, or if we incur charges or costs in amounts that are greater than anticipated, our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected to a greater degree than we currently expect.\nFinally, we have incurred other significant expenses related to restructuring of our operations in the past and may continue to in the future. We have incurred in the past, and may incur in the future, costs related to workforce reductions and facility closures. We may be required to record additional charges related to restructuring activities in the future, but cannot predict the timing or amount of such charges. Any such charges would reduce our earnings.\nOur design and manufacturing processes and services may result in exposure to intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us, which could harm our business.\nOur design and manufacturing services offerings involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties. In addition, our customers may require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement. If any claims are brought against us or our customers for such infringement, whether or not they have merit, we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of such claims. In the event of such an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses. We may not be successful in developing such alternatives or obtaining such licenses on reasonable terms or at all.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings, which could result in unexpected expenditures of time and resources.\nIn the past, we have been notified of claims relating to various matters including, among other things, intellectual property rights, contractual matters or other issues arising in the ordinary course of business. In the event of such a claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to defend or otherwise address the claim. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. Any litigation, even where a claim is without merit, could result in substantial costs, such as legal fees, and diversion of resources. Accordingly, the resolution or adjudication of such disputes, even those encountered in the ordinary course of business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Regardless of the subject matter, any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.\nWe may be required to recognize additional impairment charges.\nPursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are required to evaluate for impairment periodically and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable. During 2017, we identified a triggering event related to property, plant and equipment in our U.S. segment asset group and recorded an impairment loss related to the U.S. segment of $1.0 million. In addition, during 2017, we recorded an impairment loss of $0.6 million related predominantly to machinery and equipment in our China segment. During 2019, we recorded an impairment loss of $0.2 million related to machinery and equipment in our China segment, which would not otherwise be transferred to our other manufacturing facilities. Disruptions and reductions to our business, unexpected significant declines in the operating results, divestitures and enterprise value declines may result in future impairment charges to property, plant and equipment. Any future impairment charge could substantially affect our reported results during those periods.\nTariffs imposed by the United States and those imposed in response by other countries, as well as rapidly changing trade relations, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nModifications of U.S. laws and policies governing foreign trade and investment (including trade agreements and tariffs, such as those tariffs imposed on specified imports from China) could adversely affect our supply chain, business and results of operations. For example, in September 2019, the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $125 billion worth of imported goods from China. These tariffs have increased the costs of certain components sourced from China which increases the costs to our customers. The implementation of additional tariffs and retaliatory tariffs from trade partners or related uncertainties could further increase the cost of certain of our imported materials, which could thereby adversely affect our profitability if not accepted and paid by our customers.\nOur financial results depend, in part, on our ability to perform on our U.S. government contracts, and changes in government defense spending and priorities could have consequences on our financial position, results of operations and business.\nIn fiscal years 2019 and 2018, U.S. government sales accounted for approximately 6.6% and 2.4% of our total revenues, respectively. Our revenues from the U.S. government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various U.S. government programs, primarily defense-related programs with the DoD. The funding of our programs is subject to the overall U.S. government policies, budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events, macroeconomic conditions, and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation, such as appropriations bills and accords on the debt ceiling.\nIn recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation. In addition, in recent years the U.S. government has been unable to complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year, resulting in both a governmental shut-down and continuing resolutions to extend sufficient funds only for U.S. government agencies to continue operating.\nAs a result, defense spending levels are difficult to predict beyond the near-term due to numerous factors, including the external threat environment, future governmental priorities and the state of governmental finances. Significant changes in defense spending or changes in U.S. government priorities, policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nGovernment contracts are subject to significant procurement rules and regulations. Changes in such rules, regulations and business practice could negatively affect current programs and potential awards, and our business could be negatively affected if we fail to comply with any procurement rules and regulations.\nU.S. government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements including export-import control, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, audit and product integrity requirements. These requirements impact our performance and compliance costs. In addition, the U.S. government has implemented, and may continue to implement, initiatives focused on efficiencies, affordability and cost growth and other changes to its procurement practices which may negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, and could affect whether and, if so, how we pursue certain opportunities and the terms under which we are able to do so.\nIn addition, failure to comply with the procurement regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, cash withholds on contract payments, forfeiture of profits, and the assessment of civil and criminal penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Our failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could also lead to suspension or debarment, for cause.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.\nThe accuracy and appropriateness of certain costs and expenses used to substantiate our direct and indirect costs for U.S. government contracts are subject to extensive regulation and audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, an arm of the DoD. Such audits and reviews could result in adjustments to our contract costs and profitability. However, we cannot ensure the outcome of any future audits and adjustments may be required to reduce net sales or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. If any audit or review were to uncover inaccurate costs or improper activities, we could be subject to penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from conducting future business with the U.S. government. Any such outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls such that there is a reasonably possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis if these deficiencies are not remediated appropriately or timely.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. We are also required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d), which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of controls over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm is also required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. Internal controls related to the operation of technology systems are critical to maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of this Form 10-K, during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, management identified a material weakness in internal control related to ineffective information technology general controls in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information technology systems that support the Company\u2019s financial reporting processes. As a result, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 29, 2019.\nWe are implementing remedial measures and, while we make no assurance that our efforts will be successful, we plan to remediate the material weakness by mid-2020. These measures will result in additional technology and other expenses. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness, or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.\nWe make no assurance that significant deficiencies or other material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. The existence of a significant deficiency or additional material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could in turn result in a restatement of the consolidated financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or cause lenders, suppliers, customers and investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. Any combination of the above could lead to harmful effects on our business and a decline in our stock price. In addition, a material weakness, such as the one disclosed in Part II, Item 9A of this Form 10-K, could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial reporting and may negatively affect the price of our common stock. We also make no assurances that we will be able to remediate any future internal control deficiencies timely and in a cost effective manner. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary to produce reliable financial reports and to prevent fraud. If we are unable to satisfactorily remediate future deficiencies or if we discover other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, such deficiencies may lead to misstatements in our financial statements or otherwise negatively impact our business, financial results and reputation.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and severely limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business.\nWe borrow money under an amended and restated revolving credit and security agreement, with PNC Bank, National Association (\u201cPNC\u201d), which governs the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility (the \u201cPNC Facility\u201d). The PNC Facility has a term ending on November 8, 2023. Advances made under the PNC Facility bear interest at the U.S. base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.25%, or the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus an applicable margin ranging from 2.50% to 3.00%. The base commercial lending rate should approximate U.S. prime rate.\nWe also borrow money under a financing agreement, the lenders from time to time party thereto, TCW Asset Management Company LLC, as administrative agent for the lenders, and TCW Asset Management Company LLC, as collateral agent for the lenders govern a term loan A facility (the \u201cTerm A Loan Facility\u201d and, together with the PNC Facility, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d) and previously governed a term loan B facility (the \u201cTerm Loan B Facility\u201d) until it was paid in full on July 3, 2019. The Term Loan A Facility matures on November 8, 2023 (the \u201cMaturity Date\u201d). The Term Loan A Facility bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 8.75% through June 30, 2020, and borrowings will thereafter bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 7.25% to 8.75%. Payments made under the Term Loan A Facility at any time prior to the Maturity Date (other than scheduled amortization payments and mandatory prepayments) are subject to an applicable premium equal to the amount of such payment multiplied by (i) 3.00% in the event that such payment occurred before November 8, 2019, (ii) 2.00% in the event that such payment occurs after November 8, 2019 and on or November 8, 2020 and (iii) 1.00% in the event that such payment occurs after November 8, 2020 and on or before November 8, 2021. No such applicable premium is payable for any payment of loans made under the Term Loan A Facility occurring after November 8, 2021.\nAt December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, $34.7 million and $25.0 million, respectively, was outstanding under the PNC Facility and was classified as a current liability based on the requirement to hold a \u201clock-box\u201d under the terms of the PNC Facility. As at December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, the funds available to borrow under the PNC Facility after deducting the current borrowing base conditions was $21.6 million and $14.0 million, respectively. The maximum amount of funds that could be available under the PNC Facility is $65.0 million. However, availability under the PNC Facility is subject to certain conditions, including borrowing base conditions based on eligible inventory and accounts receivable, and certain conditions as determined by PNC. We are required to use a \u201clock-box\u201d arrangement for the PNC Facility, whereby remittances from customers are swept daily to reduce the borrowings under this facility.\nAt December 29, 2019 $38.8 million was outstanding under the Term Loan A Facility, net of deferred financing fees of $2.3 million and a discount on debt of $1.5 million, related to outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. At December 30, 2018, $62.0 million, was outstanding under the Term Loan A and Term B Facility, net of deferred financing fees of $2.8 million, and a discount on debt of $1.8 million related to outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our common stock.\nOur debt outstanding under the Credit Facilities could have adverse consequences for our business, including, among others:\n\u2022\nwe are more vulnerable to adverse general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nwe are required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to repayment of debt, including interest limiting the availability of cash for other purposes;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes;\n\u2022\nwe may have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nwe could be limited in our borrowing of additional funds and making strategic investments by restrictive covenants and the borrowing base formula in our credit arrangements; and\n\u2022\nwe may fail to comply with covenants under our Credit Facilities.\nAlthough we were in compliance with the financial covenants included in the Credit Facilities as of December 29, 2019 we make no assurance that we will be in compliance with these covenants going forward. If we breach any of these restrictive covenants, the lenders could either refuse to lend funds to us, accelerate the repayment of any outstanding borrowings or declare an event of default. If an event of default occurs and is not cured or waived, it could result in all amounts outstanding, together with accrued interest, becoming immediately due and payable unless we obtain a waiver from the applicable lender. We may not have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness upon a default or be unable to receive a waiver of the default from the lender. If we are unable to repay the indebtedness, the lender could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or collection proceedings with respect to the assets which secure our indebtedness under the Credit Facilities.\nOur leverage and restrictions contained in the Credit Facilities may materially adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. In addition, our ability to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness and to satisfy our other obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, certain of which are beyond our control.\nWe face significant restrictions on our ability to operate our business as a result of the covenant restrictions under our Credit Facilities.\nThe terms of our Credit Facilities generally restrict, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, complete acquisitions, make certain investments, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments, consummate certain asset sales, make capital expenditures, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, merge, consolidate or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of our assets (other than in the ordinary course of business). The PNC Facility also has a borrowing base formula that limits our ability to borrow based on the characteristics, including geographic location of our accounts receivable and inventory. Substantially all of our assets and those of our subsidiaries are pledged as security under our Credit Facilities. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand the current or future downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise, any of which could place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors.\nIf we are not able to comply with these covenants and requirements or obtain the prior approval from the applicable lender, the lenders have the right to demand accelerated payment and we would have to seek alternative sources of financing, which may not be available, or be available on acceptable terms. In addition, we could be prohibited from engaging in transactions which could be beneficial to our business and our stockholders. Furthermore, customers may lose confidence in us and reduce or eliminate their orders with us, which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our borrowing base is diminished we may not have sufficient access to capital to finance operations or capital needs.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and thus make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our Credit Facilities. If our cash flow is not sufficient to service our debt and adequately fund our business, we may be required to seek further additional financing or refinancing or dispose of assets. We might not be able to influence any of these alternatives on satisfactory terms or at all. Our indebtedness could also:\n\u25cf\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse general economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to dedicate a more substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, investments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf\nlimit our ability to make required payments under our existing contractual commitments, including our existing long-term indebtedness;\n\u25cf\nlimit our ability to fund a change of control offer;\n\u25cf\nrequire us to sell certain assets;\n\u25cf\nrestrict us from making strategic investments, including acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u25cf\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in market conditions, our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u25cf\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u25cf\ncause us to incur substantial fees from time to time in connection with debt amendments or refinancings;\n\u25cf\nincrease our exposure to rising interest rates because our borrowings are at variable interest rates; and\n\u25cf\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow on terms that are satisfactory to us.\nFurthermore, because our debt is variable-rate debt, fluctuations in interest rates could have a material effect on our business. As a result, we may incur higher interest costs if interest rates increase. These higher interest costs could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and the levels of cash we maintain for working capital.\nFor more information about our indebtedness, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Capital Resources\u201d of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may incur more debt and undertake additional obligations. Incurring such debt or undertaking such additional obligations could increase the risks to our financial condition.\nAlthough the agreements governing the Credit Facilities contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could increase. To the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks to our financial condition would increase.\nWhile the agreements governing the Credit Facilities also contains restrictions on our ability to make loans and investments, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the investments incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.\nTo service our significant indebtedness, we will require cash and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy these obligations or to refinance these obligations on acceptable terms, or at all.\nOur ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control. Our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and research and development efforts will depend on, among other things, our ability to generate cash in the future, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, and the future availability of borrowings under the PNC Facility, which depends on, among other things, our complying with the covenants in the agreements governing the Credit Facilities. Our historical financial results have been, and we expect our future financial results will be, subject to fluctuation based upon a wide variety of factors, many of which are not within our control including, among others, those described in this section. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our PNC Facility or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs.\nUnfavorable changes in any of the foregoing factors could harm our operating results and our ability to generate cash to service our debt obligations. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements, may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to complete those dispositions for fair market value or at all, and any proceeds that we could realize from any such dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due. Also, certain of these actions would require the consent of our lenders. The terms of our financing agreements contain limitations on our ability to incur debt. See \u201c-Risks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock-Sales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, including sales by our directors and/or executive officers and/or the holders of our warrants upon the exercise of such warrants, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\u201d\nDowngrades of our credit ratings could adversely affect us.\nWe can be adversely affected by downgrades of our credit ratings, which are a factor influencing our ability to access capital and the terms of any new indebtedness, including covenants and interest rates. Our customers and vendors may also consider our credit profile when negotiating contract terms, and if they were to change the terms on which they deal with us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nChanges in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.\nAmounts drawn under the Credit Facilities may bear interest rates in relation to LIBOR, depending on our selection of repayment options. In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to USD-LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from USD-LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to USD-LIBOR. In November 2019 the FASB approved an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) to provide temporary, optional guidance to ease the reporting burden in accounting for, or recognizing the effects of, reference rate reform on financial reporting. The Board expects to issue a final ASU in 2020. The guidance will address stakeholder operational challenges, help simplify the migration process away from reference rates such as LIBOR and reduce related costs. However, at this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates or other reforms may adversely affect the trading market for LIBOR-based securities, including certain of our debt that is indexed to USD-LIBOR. Furthermore, we may need to renegotiate any credit agreements extending beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. There is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of LIBOR or of any particular replacement rate. As such, potential effect of any such event on our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot yet be determined.\nRISKS RELATED TO TAX LOSS UTILIZATION AND TAX REGULATION\nOur ability to recognize tax benefits on our existing U.S. net operating loss position may be limited.\nWe have generated substantial loss carryforwards and other tax assets for U.S. tax purposes that can be used to reduce our future federal income tax obligations. Our ability to fully use these tax assets will be adversely affected if we have an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cIRC\u201d). An ownership change is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point increase in equity ownership by \u201cfive-percent shareholders\u201d (as that term is defined for purposes of Section 382 of the IRC) in a rolling three-year period.\nAt our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we ratified the extension of the SMTC Corporation Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, (the \u201cPlan\u201d) for an additional three year period, expiring on December 29, 2020 in order to protect our ability to utilize our net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and other tax assets from an \u201cownership change\u201d under U.S. federal income tax rules. We continue to have and utilize our net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and intend to extend the Plan at our next Annual Meeting of Stockholders. However, there is no guarantee that the Plan will be effective in protecting our NOLs and other tax assets or that Stockholders will vote to extend.\nIn the past, we have had historical net operating losses expire unutilized. If the Company continues to be unable to generate sufficient taxable income, these losses will continue to expire unutilized and we may not be able to recognize the tax benefits that could arise from such tax losses.\nThere may be adverse impact resulting from government tax reform on the Company's tax returns and consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company operates in various foreign jurisdictions and has substantial tax operating loss carryforwards. Accordingly, the Company expects that potential future tax reform could have substantial impact on the Company\u2019s tax filings and consolidated financial statements related to its income tax expense (recovery) and deferred tax assets (liabilities) and corresponding disclosures.\nThere may be adverse consequences resulting from future governmental tax audits of the Company's tax returns.\nThe Company has taken various tax positions in determining its tax liabilities and the related expense. It is possible that future tax audits or changes in tax regulation may require the Company to change its prior period tax returns and also to incur additional costs. This may negatively affect future period results.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur common stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent investors from being able to sell their shares at or above the price you paid for such shares. Many factors, which are outside our control, may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including those described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and this Annual Report Form 10-K, as well as the following:\n\u25cf\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u25cf\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry compared to market expectations;\n\u25cf\nconditions that impact demand for our services;\n\u25cf\nfuture announcements concerning our business or our competitors\u2019 businesses;\n\u25cf\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf\nthe size of our public float;\n\u25cf\ncoverage by or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet their expectations;\n\u25cf\nmarket and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u25cf\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u25cf\nchanges in laws or regulations which adversely affect our industry or us;\n\u25cf\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u25cf\nchanges in senior management or key personnel;\n\u25cf\nissuances or sales, or expected issuances or sales of our capital stock;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our dividend policy;\n\u25cf\nadverse resolution of new or pending litigation against us; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war and responses to such events.\nThese broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low. As a result, investors may suffer a loss on their investment.\nOur principal stockholders exercise a considerable degree of control over our Company.\nAs of December 29, 2019, our executive officers, directors and entities affiliated with our five percent stockholders beneficially owned, in the aggregate, shares representing approximately 32% of our outstanding common stock. Although we are not aware of any voting arrangements in place among these stockholders, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, as a result of their stock ownership, they would be able to influence our management and affairs and control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or affecting the liquidity and volatility of our common stock, and might affect the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public markets, including sales by our directors or executive officers and/or the holders of our warrants upon the exercise of such warrants, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market, including sales by our directors or executive officers and/or the holders of our warrants upon the exercise of such warrants, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or the market perception that we are permitted to sell a significant number of our securities would have on the market price of our common stock.\nWe may require additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations, and we may seek additional funding through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, or other third-party business arrangements. These financing activities may have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 rights, the market price of our common stock and on our operations and may require us to issue additional equity or debt securities, or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us. Any sale or issuance of securities pursuant to a registration statement or otherwise may result in dilution to our stockholders and may cause the market price of our stock to decline, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders. In addition, the agreements governing our indebtedness impose restrictive covenants on our operations. Any future debt financings may impose additional restrictive covenants or otherwise adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders, and any additional equity financings will be dilutive to our stockholders. Furthermore, additional equity or debt financing might not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all.\nFinally, in the future, in addition to financings, we may issue additional shares of our common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock in connection with an acquisition, employee arrangements, or otherwise. Any such issuance could result in substantial dilution to our then-existing stockholders and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a third party from acquiring us and consequently decrease the market value of an investment in our stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated by-laws, and Delaware corporate law each contain provisions that could delay, defer, or prevent a change in control of us or changes in our management. The provisions include, among others:\n\u25cf\nadvance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u25cf\nthe inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our amended and restated by-laws;\n\u25cf\nprohibiting the use of cumulative voting for the election of directors; and\n\u25cf\nthe authority of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as our board of directors may determine.\nThese provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions, which may prevent a change of control or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, to which we are subject, prohibits us, except under specified circumstances, from engaging in any mergers, significant sales of stock or assets or business combinations with any shareholder or group of shareholders who owns at least 15% of our common stock for three years following their becoming the owner of 15% of our common stock, which may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of us. Any delay or prevention of a change of control or change in management that stockholders might otherwise consider to be favorable could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock in the future, which could make it difficult for another company to acquire us or could otherwise adversely affect holders of our common stock, which could depress the price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue one or more series of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors will have the authority to determine the preferences, limitations and relative rights of the shares of preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock. The potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of us, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium to the market price, and materially and adversely affect the market price and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our Company, or if they issue unfavorable commentary about us or our industry or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that third-party securities analysts publish about us and our industry. If one or more analysts cease coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the market. In addition, one or more of these analysts could downgrade our common stock or issue other negative commentary about our company or our industry. As a result of one or more of these factors, the trading price of our common stock could decline.", "PERMNO": 88466, "SIC": 3672, "TIC": "SMTX"}
