Risk Factors\nAn investment in our Company is highly speculative in nature and involves an extremely high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following material risks, together with the other information contained in this report, before you decide to buy our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition would likely suffer. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nWe have no relevant operating history; we have accumulated deficits; we are only in an initial commercialization stage with technology that is unproven on a large-scale commercial basis; and there is a going concern explanatory paragraph in our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s report.\nOur company reduced daily operations in late 2005 and essentially ceased daily operations in May 2006. Through January 2009, we were substantially inactive. In February 2009, we entered into a technology license agreement for a process to produce lithium metal. We do not utilize this technology for any purpose because it did not produce the intended result. From 2012 to the present, we have devoted our resources to develop a different lithium manufacturing technology from that initially undertaken in 2009. Because we are still in the developmental stage, there is no relevant operating history upon which an evaluation of our performance and prospects can be made. We are subject to all of the business risks associated with a new enterprise, including, but not limited to, risks of unforeseen capital requirements, failure of market acceptance, failure to establish business relationships and competitive disadvantages as against larger and more established companies.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our financial statements included in this report includes a \u201cgoing concern\u201d explanatory paragraph. As reflected in the consolidated financial statements, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $13.7 million at December 31, 2016, a net loss of approximately $3.8 million and $1.8 million, and approximately $1.5 million and $895,000 net cash used in operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have generated no revenues from our lithium technology and will not generate any meaningful revenues until after we have successfully commercialized our new proprietary technology to manufacture high purity lithium metal and associated products, of which no assurance can be given. Since December 31, 2016, we have continued to incur significant losses and anticipate that we may continue to incur significant losses in 2017 and beyond. There can be no assurance as to whether or when we will generate meaningful revenues or achieve profitable operations.\nOur lithium production technology has never been utilized on a large-scale basis, and there can be no assurance that this technology will perform successfully on a large-scale commercial basis or that it will be profitable for us. All of the tests conducted to date by us with respect to our new process and technology have been conducted in the laboratory on small scale only, and there can be no assurance that the same or similar results could be obtained on a large-scale commercial basis. Additionally, our ability to operate our business successfully will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control, including competition, cost and availability of strategic components, changes in governmental initiatives and requirements, changes in regulatory requirements, and the costs associated with commencing pilot manufacturing.\nWe have not been able, and may continue to be unable, to timely file periodic reports with the SEC.\nWe did not timely file our annual reports for the years ending 2013, 2014 and 2015 with the SEC. We also did not timely file our quarterly reports relating to 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016. If we are not able to file future periodic reports in the time specified by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, stockholders and potential investors will not have current public information about us which will likely have a negative effect on our obtaining future capital. Failure to make timely filings also impairs our ability to conduct certain kinds of public offerings on short form registration statements that provide more efficient automatic forward incorporation of future SEC filings. Our inability to timely file periodic reports could materially and adversely affect our future business growth and financial condition.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and the trading price of our stock.\nDuring the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Management determined the control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in the trading price of our stock.\nThere remains uncertainty of any market acceptance of our technology to manufacture lithium metal.\nMany prospective users of lithium metal have already committed substantial resources to other existing forms of battery technology. Our growth and future financial performance will depend on our ability to demonstrate to prospective users the technical and economic advantages of our technology to manufacture lithium metal over alternative technologies. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in this effort. Furthermore, it is possible that competing technologies may be perceived to have, or may actually have, certain advantages over our technology or lithium metal in general for certain industries or applications.\nWe have a need for additional financing in the foreseeable future.\nDuring the past two years, financing for all of our activities has been provided in the form of direct equity investments, private placements and advances from our officers and directors. Our future capital requirements could vary significantly and will depend on certain factors, many of which are not within our control. These include the ongoing development and testing of our technology to manufacture lithium metal, the nature and timing of prospective commercial projects and permits required and the availability of financing. In the battery market, we may not be able to enter into favorable business collaborations and might thus be required to seek project contracts for our own account. If such efforts were successful, we would be required to make significant expenditures on personnel and capital equipment which would require significant financing. In addition, our lack of operational experience and limited capital resources could make it difficult, if not highly unlikely, to successfully secure major projects. In such event, our business development could be limited to smaller commercial projects with significantly lower potential for profit.\nIn addition, the expansion of our business will require the commitment of significant capital resources toward the hiring of technical and operational support personnel and the development of a manufacturing and testing facility. In the event we are presented with one or more significant projects, individually or in conjunction with collaborative working partners, we may require additional capital to take advantage of such opportunities. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on favorable terms. If adequate financing is not available, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate certain of our research and development programs, to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies, or to license third parties to commercialize technologies that we would otherwise seek to develop ourselves. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, stockholders will be diluted.\nWe may not be able to obtain or enforce patent rights or other intellectual property rights that cover our product candidates and technologies that are of sufficient breadth to prevent third parties from competing against us.\nOur success with respect to our product candidates and technologies will depend in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in both the United States and other countries, to preserve our trade secrets and to prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights. Our ability to protect any of our product candidates from unauthorized or infringing use by third parties depends in substantial part upon our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents.\nOur patent portfolio currently is made up entirely of pending patent applications. Any patents that we do obtain may be narrow in scope and thus easily circumvented by competitors. Further, in countries where we do not have granted patents, third parties may be able to make, use or sell products identical to or substantially similar to, our product candidates. The patent application process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prepare, file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, such as with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship, claim scope or patent term adjustments. If there are material defects in the form or preparation of our patent applications, such applications may be invalid and unenforceable. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe face competition and technical alternatives in the overall battery market.\nWe anticipate that our primary market will be for lithium metal batteries. We have had limited experience in manufacturing and marketing our technology and have not previously had any employees or personnel whose primary responsibilities consisted of these functions. Other participants include several large domestic and international companies and numerous small companies, many of whom have substantially greater financial and other resources and more manufacturing, marketing and sales experience than we do. In addition, as lithium metal technology evolves, there exists the possibility that our technology may be rendered obsolete by one or more competing technologies. Any one or more of our competitors, or one or more other enterprises not presently known to us, may develop technologies which are superior to our technology. To the extent that our competitors are able to offer more cost-effective alternatives, our ability to compete could be materially and adversely affected.\nThere can be no assurance that we will enter into collaborative agreements or projects utilizing our technology in the future.\nWe propose to pursue opportunities in the battery market through collaborative joint working arrangements with companies that have a significant presence in well-established industries or markets, and that can introduce our technology to industry participants. However, neither we nor any of our prospective collaborative joint working partners have secured any project contracts. There can be no assurance that we will enter into any definitive joint project arrangements with our prospective working partners or others, or that any such definitive arrangements will be on terms and conditions that will enable us to generate profits. Furthermore, even if we are successful in obtaining one or more project awards, such projects may be curtailed or eliminated, or other problems may arise, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our senior executive officers and other personnel to run our business.\nWe are dependent on the efforts of our senior executive officers, particularly Jerome I. Feldman, our Executive Chairman and until March 1, 2017, our Chief Financial Officer, Steven M. Fludder, our Chief Executive Officer, and Nathan J. Wasserman, our Chief Financial Officer since March 1, 2017. We do not have key-man life insurance policies on the lives of Messrs. Feldman and Fludder to compensate us for the loss of such individuals. The loss of the services of any one or more of such persons may have a material adverse effect on our company.\nOur future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain skilled scientific, management, operational and marketing personnel. Other than Messrs. Feldman, Fludder, and Wasserman we do not currently have any employees or personnel whose responsibilities are focused primarily in these fields. We face competition for hiring such personnel from other companies, including companies that have greater resources. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.\nWe rely on third-party research organizations and as a result we are unable to directly control the timing, conduct, expense and quality of our research and development efforts.\nWe have entered into research agreements with a number academic research institutions as part of our process for developing and validating our core technology. In relying on those third parties, we are dependent upon them to timely and accurately perform their services, and dependent on them to accurately analyze the viability of our method to produce Lithium metal. If these third-party organizations do not accurately collect and assess data and communicate their findings to us accurately, we may discontinue development of viable products or methods or continue allocating resources to the development of products and methods that are not efficacious. Either outcome could result in significant financial harm to us.\nBecause we have entered into a substantial financial commitment for leased office and laboratory space, funds may be diverted from other important matters in the development of our business and could negatively impact our financial position.\nOn March 22, 2016, the Company entered into a lease for office and laboratory space located in Yonkers, New York, consisting of approximately 8,000 square feet. The lease has a term of 87 months and the annual rent for the first year of the lease is approximately $208,000, increasing by 1.5% in each subsequent year. In the event of a termination of the lease following a default by the Company, the Company will be obligated to pay the sum of the rent payable for the remainder of the lease term. This represents a substantial financial commitment for us. Money that could be spent elsewhere will be needed to fulfill the lease commitment, which may divert funds away from other important matters in the development of our business and could negatively impact our financial position. We have not yet occupied this leased space, and as of the date of this Form 10-K we have not yet begun to pay rent, however, the expense associated with this lease will constitute a large operating costs and may contribute to net losses as a result.\nWe will need to comply with government regulations, which can be costly and time-consuming.\nWe may be required to comply with a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the areas of safety, health and environmental controls, including without limitation, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA), which may require us to obtain permits or approvals to utilize, handle, and dispose of lithium metal and/or other chemicals. Furthermore, particularly in the battery market, we may be required to conduct performance and operating studies to assure government agencies that our technology does not pose environmental or product safety risks. Changes in environmental or safety regulations, the discovery of conditions not currently known to us, or other developments could result in the imposition of additional or different environmental compliance obligations or expenditure for capital improvements. We do not believe at this time that financial obligations incurred in connection with environmental regulatory compliance will have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s financial condition, competitive position or results of operations. Our belief is based on the company\u2019s understanding of the underlying facts giving rise to its environmental regulatory obligations.\nWe are controlled by a small number of \u201cinsider\u201d stockholders.\nOur directors and executive officers currently beneficially own approximately 66.2% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, through their collective ownership of our outstanding common stock, if they act together, they will be able to control the voting of our shares at all meetings of stockholders and, because the common stock does not have cumulative voting rights, will be able to determine the outcome of the election of all of our directors and determine corporate and stockholder action on other matters.\nWe have no plans to pay dividends.\nWe have never paid any dividends on our common stock and have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We have not to date and do not expect to pay a dividend on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock is within the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to our certificate of incorporation. We intend to retain any earnings for use in our operations and any expansion of our business. Payment of dividends in the future will depend on our future earnings, future capital needs and our operating and financial condition, among other factors.\nIt is likely that our common stock price will be volatile.\nThe stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performances of specific companies. Announcements of new technologies and changing policies and regulations of the federal government and state governments and other external factors, as well as potential fluctuations in our financial results, may have a significant impact on the price of our stock.\nOur charter contains some anti-takeover provisions that may inhibit a takeover.\nThe provisions in our certificate of incorporation relating to a classified Board of Directors and delegation to the Board of Directors of rights to determine the terms of preferred stock may have the effect not only of discouraging attempts by others to buy us, but also of making it more difficult or impossible for existing stockholders to make management changes. A classified board, which is made up of directors elected for staggered terms, while promoting stability in board membership and management, also moderates the pace of any change in control of our Board of Directors by extending the time required to elect a majority, effectively requiring action in at least two annual meetings. The ability of our Board of Directors to determine the terms of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible business purchases and other corporate purposes, could make it more difficult for a third party to secure a majority of our outstanding common stock. Additionally, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control.", "PERMNO": 85233, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "ALPE"}
