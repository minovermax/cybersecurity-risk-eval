Risk Factors\nA description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business is set forth below. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be harmed. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. Many of the following risks and uncertainties are, and will be, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nFactors adversely affecting the live event market could impact our results of operations.\nWe help creators organize, promote and sell tickets and registrations to a broad range of events. Our business is directly affected by the success of such events and our revenue is impacted by the number of events, types of events and ticket prices of events produced by creators. Adverse trends in one or more event industries could adversely affect our business. A decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of events may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income.\nThe ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and the preventative and protective actions that governments, other third parties or we have taken or may in the future take in respect of COVID-19, including government lockdowns and quarantine measures, have resulted, and will continue to result, in business disruption and reduced operations. In 2021, we saw the loosening of government-mandated COVID-19 restrictions during periods of improved COVID-19 infection levels. However, upon worsening COVID-19 infection rates in certain locations as a result of the delta and omicron variants, some national, regional and local governmental authorities have either re-imposed some or all of the earlier restrictions or imposed other restrictions, in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Further, negative public perception of the health risks from COVID-19, even in areas where local authorities have not re-imposed lockdown or quarantine measures, has caused and may continue to cause individuals to change their behaviors to reduce their risk of exposure to COVID-19, including by limiting their time gathering with others.\nIn late 2020 and early 2021, vaccines for combating COVID-19 were approved by health agencies in certain countries and regions in which we operate (including the United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Canada and Australia) and began to be administered. While a significant portion of the populations in the countries and regions in which we operate has been vaccinated, vaccine availability is still limited in many countries and regions, and vaccine uptake, including booster vaccination, has been limited in certain countries in which we operate, including the United States and United Kingdom. Further, the rate of \u201cbreakthrough\u201d COVID-19 cases in fully or partially vaccinated individuals may affect consumer behavior and the live event market and adversely affect our business.\nOn September 9, 2021, President Biden announced plans for the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, to issue an Emergency Temporary Standard, or ETS, mandating that all employers with more than 100 employees ensure their workers are either fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or produce, on a weekly basis, a negative COVID-19 test. On November 4, 2021, OSHA issued the ETS, which would have required covered employers to comply with the vaccine mandate beginning with January 4, 2022 or face substantial penalties for non-compliance. While the Supreme Court reinstated a stay on the federal vaccine mandate, it is possible that the stay could be lifted or additional, more protective vaccine mandates may be announced by state or local jurisdictions that could impact our workforce and operations. Although we cannot predict with certainty the impact that the ETS and any other related measures will have on our workforce and operations, these requirements and any such future requirements may result in attrition and impede our ability to recruit and retain our workforce.\nThere is significant uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the long-term health impact of COVID-19, the emergence or severity of new variants, the actions taken to contain outbreaks or mitigate the impact of COVID-19, whether on a national, regional or local level, the distribution, uptake and efficacy of vaccines, and changes in consumer behavior and the live event market in response to COVID-19, both during and after the acute stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. The full extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition cannot be predicted at this time and the impact of COVID-19 may persist for an extended period of time or become more pronounced.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact the business and operations of third party service providers who perform critical services for our business, which in turn may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, our business depends on discretionary consumer and corporate spending. During periods of economic slowdown and recession such as the worldwide recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other periods of economic instability or uncertainty, consumers have historically reduced their discretionary spending. In addition, as a result of labor and materials shortages and supply chain delays exacerbated by COVID-19, many regions have experienced and are continuing to experience rising consumer prices. With the rise in prices of essential goods and services, consumers have historically reduced their discretionary spending. The impact of economic slowdowns and rising consumer prices on our business is difficult to predict, but they may result in reductions in ticket and registration sales and our ability to generate revenue. Many factors related to discretionary consumer and corporate spending, including employment, fuel prices, interest and tax rates and inflation, can adversely impact our results of operations.\nIn addition, the occurrence and threat of extraordinary events, such as public health concerns, epidemics and pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), terrorist attacks, mass-casualty incidents, such as the mass casualty event at a Houston music festival in November 2021, natural disasters or similar events, or loss or restriction of individuals\u2019 rights to assemble, may deter creators from producing large events and substantially decrease the attendance at live events. For example, in January 2017, five people were killed at a music festival in Mexico ticketed by us, and in July 2019, four people were killed at a community festival in Gilroy, California, which was ticketed by us. Terrorism and security incidents, military actions in foreign locations and periodic elevated terrorism alerts have increased public concerns regarding air travel, military actions and national or local catastrophic incidents. These concerns have led to numerous challenging operating factors at live events, including additional logistics for event safety and increased costs of security. These challenges may impact the creator and attendee experience and lead to fewer events by creators and as a result may harm our results of operations.\nFurthermore, climate change is expected to continue to cause adverse weather conditions, increased weather variability and natural disasters to become more frequent and less predictable. Adverse weather and climate conditions could impact the number, size and success of events and disrupt our operations in any of our offices or the operations of creators, third-party providers, vendors or partners. If fewer events are held because of adverse weather and climate conditions, our results of operations may be harmed. If an event is cancelled or rescheduled due to weather, attendees may expect and may be entitled to a refund, which may harm our results of operations and those of creators.\nAny adverse condition, including those described above, that could lead to unsatisfied event attendees and require refunds or chargebacks or increase complexity and costs for creators and us, would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results vary from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Our results of operations in certain financial quarters or years may not be indicative of, or comparable to, our results of operations in subsequent financial quarters or years.\nOur quarterly results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control and difficult to predict. As a result, it is difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenue accurately.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the events industry and global economy have made it difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenue accurately. As a result, in 2020 we withdrew our first quarter and full year 2020 financial guidance, and we did not provide guidance for 2021. While we provided certain guidance for the first quarter of 2022 and may resume providing more detailed financial guidance, we may withdraw our guidance or discontinue providing guidance if we determine that the course of the pandemic or other conditions would render such guidance unreliable.\nBecause our results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, our financial results for one quarter or year cannot necessarily be compared to another quarter or year and may not be indicative of our future financial performance in subsequent quarters or years. Period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful, and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. In addition to other risk factors listed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, factors that may cause our results of operations to fluctuate include:\n\u2022COVID-19 and other global health conditions, epidemics or pandemics and related government prohibitions, limitations or recommendations on in-person gatherings, and creators\u2019 and consumers\u2019 perceived safety of in-person gatherings;\n\u2022changes in business or macroeconomic conditions;\n\u2022creator acquisition and retention;\n\u2022new solution introductions and expansions, or challenges with introduction;\n\u2022acquisition of companies and the success, or lack thereof, of migration of such companies\u2019 creators;\n\u2022changes in pricing or packages;\n\u2022the development and introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022increases in operating expenses that we may incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive;\n\u2022system failures or breaches of security or privacy;\n\u2022changes in stock-based compensation expenses;\n\u2022adverse litigation judgments, settlements or other litigation-related costs;\n\u2022changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to privacy or data protection, or enforcement by government regulators, including fines, orders or consent decrees;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies;\n\u2022fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and interest rates;\n\u2022changes in our effective tax rate;\n\u2022announcements by competitors or other third parties of significant new products or acquisitions or entrance into certain markets;\n\u2022our ability to make accurate accounting estimates and appropriately recognize revenue for our solutions for which there are no relevant comparable products; and\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles.\nThe seasonality of our business could create cash flow management risks if we do not adequately anticipate and plan for periods of decreased activity, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business may be subject to significant chargebacks and other losses for various reasons, including due to fraud or unsuccessful, postponed or cancelled events. These chargebacks and other losses may harm our results of operations and business.\nWe have experienced, and will continue to experience, chargebacks related to postponed or cancelled events and claims from attendees that creators have not performed their obligations or that events did not match their descriptions. These claims could arise from creator fraud or misuse, an unintentional failure of the event, which includes reschedules, indefinite postponements and cancellations, or from fraudulent claims by an attendee. We have experienced a high volume of event reschedules, postponements and cancellations because of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in 2020, which has significantly increased attendee claims and related reversals of payments received by us from payment card networks (known as chargebacks) and losses as a result of advance payment of ticket fees to creators. We may continue to experience a high volume of event reschedules, postponements and cancellations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and expect we will experience a high volume of event reschedules, postponements and cancellations in the event of future global health crises, epidemics and pandemics.\nHistorically, for qualified creators who applied for payments in advance of their events to fund event-related costs, we passed proceeds from ticket sales to the creators prior to the events as we received the ticket sales proceeds, subject to certain limitations. We refer to these payments as advance payouts. When we provide advance payouts, we assume significant risk that the event may be cancelled, postponed, fraudulent, materially not as described or removed from our platform due to its failure to comply with our terms of service, merchant agreement or community guidelines, resulting in significant chargebacks, refund requests and/or disputes between attendees and creators. This risk was exacerbated by the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. The terms of our standard merchant agreement obligate creators to repay us for ticket sales advanced under such circumstances. However, we may not be able to recover our losses from these events, and COVID-19 has significantly increased the likelihood that we will not recover these losses. Such unrecoverable amounts and third-party fees could equal up to the value of the transaction or transactions settled to the creator prior to the event that has been postponed or cancelled or is otherwise disputed. This amount could be many multiples of the fees we collected from such transactions.\nIn March 2020, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily stopped making advance payouts to creators. In late 2020, we started making advance payouts to a limited number of low risk creators, and in the second quarter of 2021, we relaunched Scheduled Payouts (advance payouts) to paid creators who qualify and accept the Company's standard or negotiated terms and conditions. As of December 31, 2021, advance payouts outstanding was approximately $319.3 million including $79.5 million of advance payouts issued since the third quarter of 2020, when we resumed the advance payout program on a limited basis.\nDue to the nature of the COVID-19 situation and the limited amount of currently available data, there is a high degree of uncertainty around the outcome of events that are currently postponed or rescheduled and the remaining advance payouts balance. It is possible that this amount will not be sufficient and our actual losses could be materially different from our current estimates. We will adjust our reserves in the future to reflect our best estimates of future outcomes. We cannot predict the outcome of or estimate the possible recovery or range of recovery from these matters.\nFurther, we have experienced fraudulent activity on our platform in the past, including fake events in which a person sells tickets to an event but does not intend to hold an event or fulfill the ticket, email spam being sent through our platform, a third party taking over the account of a creator to receive payments owed to such creator or orders placed with fraudulent or stolen credit card data and other erroneous transmissions. Although we have measures in place to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent activity on our platform, those measures are not always effective. These measures must be continually improved and may not be effective against evolving methods of fraud or in connection with new platform offerings. If we cannot adequately control the risk of fraudulent activity on our platform, it could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur corporate strategy may not be successful.\nIn April 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to refocus our strategy on acquiring and retaining creators who are able to use our platform with limited training, support or professional services, rather than creators who require significant support from our account management and/or field operations functions. As a result, we have renegotiated or terminated the contracts of many of the creators acquired through our sales channel, many of whom expected significant customer support, and reduced the size of our account management and field operations teams. At this time, we are not able to estimate the number of creators who left our platform as a result of the service level changes as opposed to those who have simply not held events due to the pandemic. Our ability to successfully implement our refocused strategy will depend on, among other things, our ability to closely manage our operating expenses and attract and retain senior management and other highly qualified personnel, and the success of our refocused strategy itself. In 2021, we re-accelerated hiring, particularly in our engineering and development functions. These hiring efforts may not be sufficient to fully execute our strategy, and we may not be able to effectively attract or retain senior management or other qualified employees needed to implement this strategy. Further, in 2022 we plan to open a talent hub in India to further support our product strategy, which may add to the complexity and costs of our business operations. As a new entrant into the Indian talent market, we may be unable to attract highly qualified personnel, and we may not successfully make our Indian Britelings part of our global Briteling community. If we are unable to hire and retain highly qualified employees in India, or if we are unable to do so in a cost effective manner, we may not be able to fully execute our strategy or realize returns on our investment in India. If we are unable to successfully execute our strategy, or if our strategy itself is not successful, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract new creators and retain existing creators.\nIn April 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to refocus our strategy on acquiring and retaining creators who are able to use our platform with limited live training, support or professional services, rather than creators who required significant support from our customer success and/or field operations functions. As part of this effort, we have reduced the size of our sales, customer success and field operations teams. Some creators who require a higher level of customer support have renegotiated or terminated their contracts with us, and more such creators may do so in the future. At this time, we are not able to estimate the number of creators who left our platform as a result of the service level changes as opposed to those who have simply not held events due to the pandemic.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract new creators and retain existing creators. In addition to risks related to our refocused strategy on self-service creators, we may fail to attract new creators and retain existing creators due to a number of factors outlined in this section, including:\n\u2022COVID-19 and other global health conditions and related government prohibitions, limitations or recommendations on in-person gatherings, and creators\u2019 and consumers\u2019 perceived safety of in-person gatherings;\n\u2022our ability to maintain and continually enhance our platform and provide products and services that are valuable and helpful to creators, which maintenance and enhancements may take place at a slower pace if we are unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of highly qualified engineering and development personnel;\n\u2022our decisions to sunset or replace features that some creators find valuable and helpful;\n\u2022our ability to offer requisite levels of customer support to creators and consumers;\n\u2022competitive factors, including the actions of new and existing competitors in our industry, such as competitors buying exclusive ticketing rights or entering into or expanding within the market in which we operate;\n\u2022our ability to convince creators to migrate to our platform from their current practices, which include online ticketing platforms, venue box offices and do-it-yourself spreadsheets and forms;\n\u2022changes in our relationships with third parties, including our partners, developers and payment processors, that make our platform less effective for and attractive to creators;\n\u2022the quality and availability of key payment and payout methods;\n\u2022our ability to manage fraud risk that negatively impacts creators; and\n\u2022our ability to adapt to changes in market practices or economic incentives for creators, including larger or more frequent signing fees.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage these risks as they occur, creators may seek other solutions and we may not be able to retain them or acquire additional creators to offset any such departures, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, the loss of creators and our inability to replace them with new creators and events of comparable quality and standing would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have a history of losses and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and maintain profitability.\nWe incurred net losses of $139.1 million and $224.7 million in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and as of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $733.6 million. Because of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue decreased significantly in the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019, and we expect that our revenue may decrease significantly in the near-term. We do not know when our net revenue will return to its pre-COVID-19 levels, if ever.\nYou should not rely on the revenue growth of any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future performance. We expect to continue to incur losses due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and the current state of the global economy. If we are unable to return to revenue growth and manage our expenses effectively, we will not be able to achieve and maintain profitability.\nIf we do not continue to maintain and improve our platform or develop successful new solutions and enhancements or improve existing ones, our business will suffer.\nOur ability to attract and retain creators depends in large part on our ability to provide a user-friendly and effective platform, develop and improve our platform and introduce compelling new solutions and enhancements. Our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology, new service and product introductions and changing demands of creators. We spend substantial time and resources understanding creators\u2019 needs and responding to them. Building new solutions is costly and complex, and the timetable for commercial release is difficult to predict and may vary from our historical experience. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we shifted our focus to attracting and retaining creators who use our platform with limited training, support or professional services and reduced our workforce by approximately 45% in 2020, including engineering and development personnel. In 2021, we reaccelerated hiring, particularly in our engineering and development functions, and in 2022 we plan to open a talent hub in India to further support our product strategy. However, these hiring efforts may not be sufficient to execute our strategy and may result in fewer, more targeted product enhancements and a slower product development timetable than we would like to achieve. In addition, after development, creators may not be satisfied with our enhancements or perceive that the enhancements do not adequately meet their needs. The success of any new solution or enhancement to our platform depends on several factors, including timely completion and delivery, competitive pricing, adequate quality testing, integration with our platform, creator awareness and overall market acceptance and adoption. If we do not continue to maintain and improve our platform or develop successful new solutions and enhancements or improve existing ones, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe rely on the experience and expertise of our founders, senior management team, key technical employees and other highly skilled personnel and the failure to retain, motivate or integrate any of these individuals could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends upon the continued service of our founders, senior management team and key technical employees, as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, retain and integrate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Each of our employees could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. The loss of any of our founders or any other member of our senior management team or key personnel might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could harm our business and our relationships. Recently, one of our founders, Renaud Visage,\ntransitioned out of the Company after 15 years of service. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees.\nTo execute on our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We have had difficulty quickly filling certain open positions in the past, and we expect to have significant future hiring needs. We face significant competition for personnel, particularly in the United States, Argentina and Spain, specifically for engineers experienced in designing and developing cloud-based platform products. In order to continue to access top talent, we are opening a talent hub in India in 2022, which may add to the complexity and costs of our business operations. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have, and we have had to offer, and believe we will need to continue to offer, increasingly competitive compensation and benefits packages. In addition, prospective and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If there is limited upside to the value of our equity awards, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain key employees. Further, across many industries, labor costs have risen dramatically in recent months. We may need to increase our employee compensation levels in response to competition, labor market conditions, rising inflation or labor shortages, which would increase our operating expenses and reduce our margins. If the ongoing labor shortage continues or worsens, we may not be able to hire new employees quickly enough to meet our needs. In addition, we may continue to experience employee turnover as a result of the ongoing \u201cgreat resignation\u201d occurring throughout the U.S. economy. New hires require training and take time before they achieve full productivity and may not become as productive as we expect. This may be more difficult given our shift to a flexible work model. If we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency and ability to meet forecasts, as well as our employee morale, productivity, and retention, could suffer, which may harm our business.\nOur corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture, we could lose the innovation, creativity and teamwork fostered by our culture, which could harm our business.\nWe believe that our corporate culture has been an important contributor to our success, which we believe fosters innovation, teamwork and passion for creators. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our global workforce worked primarily remotely in 2021, with a small subset of employees optionally returning to the office when local conditions permitted safe gathering. With most of our employees working remotely, we could face operational difficulties that could impair our ability to conduct and manage our business effectively. As we work from home, we may find it difficult to maintain our corporate culture, which could limit our ability to innovate, operate effectively and retain employees. In addition, we may face challenges in integrating new employees from our planned talent hub in India or any acquired companies into our corporate culture. Further, most of our employees have been with us for fewer than two years as a result of our April 2020 global workforce reduction and our increased hiring to implement our refocused strategy. We must effectively integrate, develop and motivate this growing number of new employees. In late-2020, we adopted our future work plan, which provides our workforce with the option to come into the office for work when our offices reopen, to come into the office occasionally or to work solely from home. While we believe this work plan will benefit our workforce and company, it is possible that it could result in operational difficulties and affect our culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could also negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, maintain our performance or execute on our business strategy, which may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur software is highly complex, and we have in the past, and may in the future, discover previously undetected errors.\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and we have in the past, and may in the future, detect previously undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after the code has been used in a production environment to deliver products and services. Any real or perceived errors, failures, bugs or other vulnerabilities discovered in our code could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation, loss of creators and attendees, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our platform, loss of competitive position, loss of revenue or liability for damages, overpayments and/or underpayments, any of which could harm the confidence of creators and attendees on our platform, our business, results of operations and financial condition. In such an event, we may be required or may choose to expend additional resources in order to help correct the problem which may divert engineering staff from building new solutions or product enhancements. Because creators use our platform for processes that are critical to their businesses, errors, failures or bugs in our code, or the underlying infrastructure, have resulted, and could in the future result, in creators seeking significant compensation from us for any losses they suffer and/or ceasing conducting business with us altogether. There can be no assurance that provisions typically included in our agreements with creators that attempt to limit our exposure to claims would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. Even if unsuccessful, a claim brought against us by any creators would likely be time-consuming and costly to defend and could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our platform relies on third party partners for the development tool chain, managed infrastructure, and platform services. These include disciplines like security, payment processing, cloud computing, data processing and storage, as well as various processes in our software development life cycle. There can be no assurance that the provisions in our agreements with our partners that attempt to limit our exposure to events like downtime, data breaches, and malicious actors would fully protect us from liabilities or damages and could result in a similar impact that we called out in our software section above. Such disruptions in our vendor supply chain would be time-consuming and costly for multiple departments, especially engineering, and result in delays in our product delivery and business strategy.\nFurther, over the past decade, we have continued to build complex code to evolve our product offerings. We are investing resources to reduce the complexity of the code underlying our software, and as a result, some of our engineering talent has been diverted from building new solutions or product enhancements. If our efforts to reduce the complexity of our code do not result in the improvement of our platform or if the diversion of our engineering staff prevents us from developing successful new solutions and enhancements, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nAny significant system interruption or delays could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of creators and adversely impact our business.\nOur ability to attract and retain creators depends on the reliable performance of our technology, including our websites, applications, information and related systems. System interruptions, slow-downs and a lack of integration and redundancy in our information systems and infrastructure may adversely affect our ability to operate our technology, handle sales for high-demand events, process and fulfill transactions, respond to creator and attendee inquiries and generally maintain cost-efficient operations.\nWe also rely on affiliate and third-party computer systems, broadband and other communications systems and service providers in connection with the provision of services generally, as well as to facilitate, process and fulfill transactions. Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems and infrastructures, our businesses, our affiliates\u2019 and/or third-party systems we use, or deterioration in the performance of these systems and infrastructures, could impair our ability to provide services, fulfill orders and/or process transactions. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, occasional system interruptions caused by outages by our partners that made, or may make, some or all systems or data unavailable or prevented, or may prevent, us from efficiently providing services or fulfilling orders. For example, in October of 2021, most of our website experienced a 3.7 hour outage because of a datastore issue with our infrastructure partners, and in March 2020, most of our website experienced a 35 minute outage because of a hardware failure at one of our infrastructure partners. Neither of these events had a material impact on the Company, but such events may reduce consumer trust in our platform.\nWe outsource our cloud infrastructure to Amazon Web Services (AWS), which hosts our platform, and therefore we are vulnerable to service interruptions at AWS, which could impact the ability of creators and attendees to access our platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance. Our customer agreement with AWS will remain in effect until July 31, 2025. In the event that our AWS service agreements are terminated, or there is a lapse of service, interruption of Internet service provider connectivity or damage to such facilities, we could experience interruptions in access to our platform as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities and services. For example, we previously experienced interruptions in performance of our platform because of a hardware error that AWS experienced. We may also incur significant costs for using an alternative cloud infrastructure provider or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage the AWS services we use.\nIn addition, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters and similar events or disruptions may damage or interrupt computer, broadband or other communications systems and infrastructures at any time. Climate change is expected to continue to cause adverse weather conditions, increased weather variability and natural disasters to become more frequent and less predictable. Any of these events could cause system interruptions, outages, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from providing services, fulfilling orders and/or processing transactions. Our headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, an area subject to earthquakes and other seismic activity. While we have backup systems for certain aspects of our operations, disaster recovery planning by its nature cannot be sufficient for all eventualities. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.\nIn some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within a period of time acceptable to creators. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our platform performance, especially during peak usage times, as the features of our platform become more complex and the usage of our platform increases. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation, cause creators to stop using our platform, impair our ability to increase revenue, impair our ability to grow our business, subject us to financial penalties and liabilities under our service level agreements and otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur platform and solutions are accessed by a large number of creators and attendees often at the same time. As we continue to expand the number of creators and attendees and solutions available to creators and attendees, we may not be able to scale our technology to accommodate the increased capacity requirements, which may result in interruptions or delays in service. Furthermore, capacity constraints could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud or security attacks. In addition, the failure of AWS cloud infrastructure or other third-party Internet service providers to meet our capacity requirements could result in interruptions or delays in access to our platform or impede our ability to scale our operations. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we cannot reach and attract attendees, our business will be harmed.\nThe ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and the preventative and protective actions that governments, other third parties or we have taken or may in the future take in respect of COVID-19, including government lockdowns and quarantine measures, have resulted, and will continue to result, in a significant decrease in the number of in-person events ticketed by our platform. With this significant drop in in-person event inventory, it is difficult for us to reach and attract attendees. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our ability to reach and attract new attendees will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the long-term health impacts of COVID-19, the emergence or severity of new variants, the actions taken to contain outbreaks or mitigate the impact of COVID-19, whether on a national, regional or local level, the distribution, uptake and efficacy of vaccines, and changes in consumer behavior and the live event market in response to COVID-19, both during and after the acute state of the COVID-19 pandemic. The full extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition cannot be predicted at this time and the impact of COVID-19 may persist for an extended period of time or become more pronounced.\nFurther, in order to continue to support creators, we need to continue to provide a compelling platform for creators to reach and attract attendees. Several factors may impact an attendee\u2019s experience with our platform, including:\n\u2022our ability to provide an easy solution for attendees to buy tickets or register for an event;\n\u2022outages or delays in our platform and other services, including delays in getting into events;\n\u2022compatibility with other third-party services, such as Facebook and Spotify, and our ability to connect with other applications through our application programming interface (API);\n\u2022fraudulent or unsuccessful events that may result in a bad experience for attendees;\n\u2022breaches and other security incidents that could compromise the data of attendees; and\n\u2022availability of our customer service channels and our ability to get information and respond to complaints and other issues in a timely and effective manner.\nIf attendees become dissatisfied with their experiences on our platform or at an event, they may request refunds, provide negative reviews of our platform or decide not to attend future events on our platform, all of which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe pay recoupable advances, to certain creators when entering into exclusive ticketing or services agreements or when we are contractually obligated to do so. In addition, we have in the past, and may in the future, pay non-recoupable payments. If these arrangements do not perform as we expect or the scheduled events are cancelled, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe pay recoupable advances (also referred to as creator advances) to certain creators in order to incentivize them to organize certain events on our platform or obtain exclusive rights to ticket their events. In addition, we have in the past, and may in the future, pay non-recoupable payments (also referred to as creator signing fees). Such payments are distinct from advance payouts in several respects, including in that non-recoupable payments and recoupable advances (together, upfront payments) involve provision of Eventbrite\u2019s own capital from our operating accounts rather than an advance of attendees\u2019 funds from our trust accounts prior to the completion of the events to which such attendees purchased tickets.\nUpfront payments are common practice in certain segments of the ticketing industry and are typically made to a creator upon entering into or renewing a multi-year exclusive ticketing or services contract with us, or upon meeting annual contractual requirements. A creator who has received a non-recoupable payment keeps the entire upfront payment, so long as the creator complies with the terms of the creator\u2019s contract with us, including but not limited to performance of an event and achievement of certain ticket sale minimums. For recoupable creator advances we are entitled to recoup the entire advance by withholding all or a portion of the ticket sales sold by the creator to whom the advance was previously paid until we have fully recouped the advance. If a creator does not comply with the terms of the contract or perform an event, generally the creator is obligated to\nrepay all or a portion of the upfront payment to us, although there is no guarantee that we will be able to collect such repayment.\nIn March 2020, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we limited the circumstances under which we would agree to provide upfront payments to creators entering into new or renewed contracts. We also renegotiate the upfront payment portion of some of our existing contracts with certain creators when such creators have missed contractual minimums to qualify for upfront payments, when such creators have experienced material adverse changes to their business or operations, or as part of contract renewal or restructuring discussions. We are continuing to evaluate our practices on upfront payments, and we do not know when, or if, we will expand the circumstances under which we offer upfront payments to new or renewing creators in the future. We believe any lack of upfront payments will put us at a competitive disadvantage to ticketing solutions that offer speculative cash incentives to newly acquired or renewing creators.\nThe multi-year exclusive arrangements that we entered into between 2016 and 2021 had an average term of 37 months and were typically for exclusive ticketing rights. Creator signing fees, net, including noncurrent balances, were $3.4 million and $9.5 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and, as of December 31, 2021, these payments were being amortized over a weighted-average remaining life of 3.0 years on a straight-line basis.\nCreator advances, net, including noncurrent balances, were $0.9 million and $6.7 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. We pay these advances based on the expectations of future ticket sales on our platform by such creators. We make the decision to make these payments based on our assessment of the past success of the creator, past event data, future events the creator is producing and other financial information. We customarily include commercial and legal protections in our contracts that include advances, such as issuing the advance only after the creator begins selling tickets on our platform and requiring a third-party to guarantee the obligations and liabilities of the creator receiving such a payment, to mitigate the financial risk of making these payments. However, event performance may vary greatly from year-to-year and from event to event. If our assumptions and expectations with respect to event performance prove wrong or if a counterparty defaults or an event is not successful or is canceled, our return on these advances will not be realized and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows or raise the additional capital necessary to fund our operations or other liquidity needs.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $634.4 million, of which $285.2 million was cash held on behalf of and due to our creators. The remaining cash and cash equivalents balance is available to us to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has drastically changed the landscape of the live events industry, we have experienced a significant decrease in our net revenues from pre-pandemic levels as a result of decreased paid ticket volume and a significant increase in our operating expenses as a result of reserves recorded for our advanced payouts program and higher impairments of creator signing fees and creator advances. Our net revenues were $187.1 million and $106.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and the net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $79.1 million and $156.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There is significant uncertainty regarding the extent and duration of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we expect.\nWe may need to raise additional funds, and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. Our ability to obtain financing will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022general economic and capital market conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the availability of credit from banks or other lenders;\n\u2022investor confidence in us; and\n\u2022our results of operations.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that we will be able to obtain financing, in an amount sufficient to fund our operations or other liquidity needs.\nIf we raise additional equity financing, our security holders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.\nIn June 2020, we issued $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.000% convertible senior notes due 2025 (2025 Notes), and in March 2021, we issued $212.75 million aggregate principal amount of 0.750% convertible senior notes due 2026 (2026 Notes and, together with the 2025 Notes, the Convertible Notes) The Convertible Notes and any additional funding from\ndebt financings may make it more difficult for us to operate our business because a portion of our cash generated from internal operations will be used to make principal and interest payments on the indebtedness and we are, or may be, obligated to abide by restrictive covenants contained in the debt financing agreements. See the risk factor below titled \u201cSubstantial levels of indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business and to fulfill our obligations under our indebtedness.\u201d\nIf we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, if at all, we may not be able to, among other things:\n\u2022develop and enhance our platform and solutions;\n\u2022continue to expand our technology development, sales and marketing organizations;\n\u2022hire, train and retain employees;\n\u2022respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements; or\n\u2022pursue acquisition opportunities.\nOur inability to do any of the foregoing could reduce our ability to compete successfully and could have an adverse effect on our business.\nSubstantial levels of indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business and to fulfill our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe have substantial outstanding debt, and we may incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Our substantial levels of indebtedness increase the possibility that we may not generate enough cash flow from operations to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of, these obligations. Other risks relating to long-term indebtedness include:\n\u2022increased vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022a need to divert a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limited ability to obtain additional financing, on terms we find acceptable, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans and other investments, which may adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy;\n\u2022limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate or to take advantage of market opportunities;\n\u2022diluting the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our Class A common stock upon conversion of the Convertible Notes; and\n\u2022a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or have better access to capital.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our indebtedness, including the Convertible Notes, and our cash needs may increase in the future. In addition, any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our other indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due, then we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary for cash settlement upon conversion of the Convertible Notes or to repurchase the Convertible Notes for cash following a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion of the Convertible Notes or to repurchase the Convertible Notes.\nSubject to limited exceptions, holders of the Convertible Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes) at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our Class A common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Convertible Notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of Convertible Notes surrendered therefor or pay the cash amounts, if any, due upon conversion. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Convertible Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Convertible Notes may be\nlimited by applicable law, by regulatory authorities or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the Convertible Notes at a time when such repurchase is required by the indenture governing the Convertible Notes or settle future conversions of the Convertible Notes as required by the indenture would constitute a default under such indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself may also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness, which may result in such existing or future indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all amounts due under such existing or future indebtedness and repurchase the Convertible Notes or make cash payments due, if any, upon conversions thereof.\nThe accounting method for the Convertible Notes could adversely affect our reported financial condition and results.\nThe accounting method for reflecting the Convertible Notes on our balance sheet, accruing amortized interest expense for the Convertible Notes and reflecting the underlying shares of our Class A common stock in our reported diluted earnings per share may adversely affect our reported earnings and financial condition.\nFor the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2021, we have elected to early adopt new accounting guidance that was recently released that simplifies the accounting for convertible debt that may be settled in cash. As a result, we expect to record the Convertible Notes entirely as a liability on our balance sheet, net of issuance costs incurred, with interest expense reflecting the cash coupon plus the amortization of the capitalized issuance costs. Additionally, the new guidance modifies the treatment of convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash or shares by requiring the use of the \u201cif-converted\u201d method. Under that method, diluted earnings per share would generally be calculated assuming that all the Convertible Notes were converted solely into shares of Class A common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. In addition, in the future, we may, in our sole discretion, irrevocably elect to settle the conversion value of the Convertible Notes in cash up to the principal amount being converted. Following such an irrevocable election, if the conversion value of the Convertible Notes exceeds their principal amount for a reporting period, then we will calculate our diluted earnings per share by assuming that all of the Convertible Notes were converted at the beginning of the reporting period and that we issued shares of our Class A common stock to settle the excess, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. The application of the if-converted method may reduce our reported diluted earnings per share.\nFurthermore, if any of the conditions to the convertibility of the Convertible Notes are satisfied, then, under certain conditions, we may be required under applicable accounting standards to reclassify the liability carrying value of the Convertible Notes as a current, rather than a long-term, liability. This reclassification could be required even if no noteholders convert their Convertible Notes and could materially reduce our reported working capital.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of the Convertible Notes and our Class A common stock.\nIn connection with the offering of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we entered into the 2025 Capped Calls, and in connection with the offering of the 2026 Notes, we entered into the 2026 Capped Calls (collectively, the Capped Calls, and the financial institutions party thereto, the Option Counterparties). The Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to our Class A common stock upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.\nWe have been advised that in connection with establishing their initial hedges of the Capped Calls, the Option Counterparties or their respective affiliates entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our Class A common stock and/or purchased shares of our Class A common stock concurrently with or shortly after the offering of the relevant Convertible Notes.\nIn addition, we have been advised that the Option Counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our Class A common stock and/or purchasing or selling our Class A common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions at any time prior to the maturity of the relevant Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so following any conversion of the relevant Convertible Notes, any repurchase of the relevant Convertible Notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date, any redemption date or any other date on which the relevant Convertible Notes are repurchased by us, in each case if we exercise our option to terminate the relevant portion of the relevant Capped Calls). This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe do not make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Convertible Notes or our Class A common stock. In addition, we do not make any representation that the Option Counterparties will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.\nProvisions in the indentures governing the Convertible Notes could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover of us.\nCertain provisions in the Convertible Notes and the indentures governing the Convertible Notes could make a third party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. For example, if a takeover constitutes a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes), then noteholders will have the right to require us to repurchase their Convertible Notes for cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the indentures governing the Convertible Notes), then we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate. In either case, and in other cases, our obligations under the Convertible Notes and the indentures governing the Convertible Notes could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a transaction that noteholders or holders of our common stock may view as favorable.\nWe face potential liability, expenses for legal claims and harm to our business based on the nature of the events business.\nWe face potential liability and expenses for legal claims relating to the events business, including potential claims related to event injuries or the spread of disease allegedly caused by us, creators, service providers, partners or unrelated third parties. For example, third parties have asserted in the past, and may assert in the future, legal claims against us in connection with personal injuries, which may include deaths, related to occurrences at an event. See the risk factor above titled \u201cFactors adversely affecting the live event market could impact our business and results of operations.\u201d Even if our personnel are not involved in these occurrences, we may face legal claims and incur substantial expenses to resolve such claims. Further, if we provide resources regarding event safety, or on-site personnel to support ticketing at an event, we may face liability related to our provision of such services, including legal claims against us in connection with personal injuries, which may include deaths or spread of disease, which may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of certain decisions we made in March 2020, we have in the past, and may in the future, face legal escalations from creators who did not receive advance payout payments, which may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, as a result of our April 2020 decision to refocus our strategy on acquiring and retaining creators who use our platform with limited training, support or professional services, we have in the past, and may in the future, face legal escalations from creators for whom we are no longer providing certain services, which may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have in the past, and may in the future, also face legal escalations from creators who did not meet contractual minimums or other contractual conditions to receive upfront payments or other creator advances, which may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may experience an increase in employment claims against us as a result of our April 2020 global workforce reduction, which may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, class action lawsuits have been filed against other players in the live events space, including StubHub and Live Nation, over their refund policies in response to events cancelled due to COVID-19. In June 2020, a similar lawsuit was filed against us, and it is possible that we will become subject to other similar claims, which may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Such actions, and other actions we may have taken or may take in the future in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, may subject us to additional legal claims or additional liability, which may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may harm our business and results of operations.\nOur business and results of operations may be affected by the outcome of pending and future litigation, claims, investigations, legal and administrative cases and proceedings, whether civil or criminal, or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties. For example, in April 2019, purported stockholders of our company filed putative securities class actions in state and federal court in California against Eventbrite, certain of our executives and directors, our underwriters for our initial public offering (IPO), and/or certain of our venture capital investors, on behalf of a putative class of persons who purchased or acquired Eventbrite securities traceable to our IPO and/or who purchased or acquired Eventbrite securities after the IPO. These actions allege violations of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act based on alleged material misrepresentations and/or omissions in our IPO offering documents and subsequent statements. The actions seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief. Regardless of whether or not there is merit to the claims underlying these class actions, any similar future litigation, or any other legal proceedings to which we are subject, and regardless of whether or not we are found as a result of such proceedings to have violated any applicable laws, such proceedings can be expensive to defend or respond to, and could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention and resources, which could harm our business, and potentially could cause substantial and irreparable harm to our public reputation. Moreover, if the results or settlement of these legal proceedings are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against third-party lawsuits, we may be required to pay monetary damages or may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions or other censure that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation. Further, our liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to satisfy, or may not cover, any expenses or liabilities that may arise. Even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a third-party lawsuit or counterclaim, we may have to devote\nsignificant financial and management resources to address these issues, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur industry is highly fragmented. We compete against traditional solutions to event management and may face significant competition from both established and new companies. If we are not able to maintain or improve our competitive position, our business could suffer.\nWe operate in a market that is highly fragmented. We compete with a variety of competitors to secure new and retain existing creators, including traditional solutions to event management, such as offline, internal or ad hoc solutions, local or specialized market competitors, products offered by large technology companies that have entered into or may enter the market, or other ticketing competitors. If we cannot successfully compete in the future with existing or potential competitors, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be harmed.\nSome of our current and potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources, are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their services, have more extensive customer bases and broader customer relationships, have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do. For example, in certain segments of the event market, event creators are accustomed to receiving upfront payments and advance payouts to incentivize them to join an event platform and to balance their cash flow needs. In March 2020, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we stopped offering upfront payments to creators entering into new or renewed ticketing arrangements with us, and we temporarily stopped making advance payouts to creators. We started making advance payouts available to a limited number of qualified creators during the third quarter of 2020. In the second quarter of 2021, we launched Scheduled Payouts, an updated advance payouts program, to paid creators who qualify and accept our standard or negotiated terms and conditions. We believe this will put us at a competitive disadvantage to ticketing solutions that offer these incentives to their creators.\nWe may also compete with potential entrants into the market that currently do not offer the same services but could potentially leverage their networks in the market in which we operate. For instance, large e-commerce companies such as eBay and Amazon have in the past operated, or currently operate, within the ticketing space. In addition, other large companies with large user-bases that have substantial event-related activity, such as Facebook, Spotify and Zoom, have recently added products in the online events space. These competitors may be better able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, build products and features faster than we can and/or offer their solutions and services at a discount to ours. Furthermore, some of our competitors may customize their products to suit a specific event type, category or customer. We also compete with self-service products that provide creators with alternatives to ticket their events by integrating such self-service products with creators\u2019 existing operations. If we are unable to compete with such alternatives, the demand for our solutions could decline.\nSome of our competitors have existing relationships or may develop relationships with potential creators or the venues or facilities used by those creators, which have in the past caused and may in the future cause those creators to be unwilling or unable to use our platform and this may limit our ability to successfully compete in certain markets where such relationships are common. For example, some competitors purchase venues or rights to events and/or enter into exclusivity agreements with creators. If creators do not remain independent from our potential competitors, demand for our platform will diminish and our business, results of operations and financial condition will be harmed.\nAcquisitions, investments or significant commercial arrangements could result in operating and financial difficulties.\nWe have acquired or entered into commercial arrangements with a number of businesses in the past, including Ticketfly and ToneDen. Our future growth may depend, in part, on future acquisitions, investments or significant commercial arrangements, any of which could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. Financial and operational risks related to acquisitions, investments and significant commercial arrangements that may have an impact on our business include:\n\u2022use of cash resources and the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in funding acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including for retirement of outstanding indebtedness and any future stock repurchases or dividend payments;\n\u2022difficulties and expenses in assimilating the operations, products, data, technology, privacy, data protection systems and information security systems, information systems or personnel of the acquired company;\n\u2022failure of the acquired company to achieve anticipated benefits, revenue, earnings or cash flows or our failure to retain key employees from an acquired company;\n\u2022the assumption of known and unknown risks, debt and liabilities of the acquired company, deficiencies in systems or internal controls and costs associated with litigation or other claims arising in connection with the acquired company;\n\u2022potential accounting charges to the extent intangibles recorded in connection with an acquisition, such as goodwill, trademarks, customer relationships, developed technology or intellectual property, are later determined to be impaired and written down in value;\n\u2022failure to properly and timely integrate acquired companies and their operations, reducing our ability to achieve, among other things, anticipated returns on our acquisitions through cost savings and other synergies;\n\u2022adverse market reaction to acquisitions;\n\u2022failure to consummate such transactions; and\n\u2022other expected and unexpected risks with pursuing acquisitions, including, but not limited to, litigation or regulatory exposure, such as our shareholder lawsuit related to disclosures about the migration of Ticketfly customers, unfavorable accounting treatment, increases in taxes due, a loss of anticipated tax benefits, costs or delays to obtain governmental approvals, diversion of management\u2019s attention or other resources from our existing business and other adverse effects on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWhen we acquire companies or other businesses, we face the risk that creators of the acquired companies or businesses may not migrate to our platform or may choose to decrease their level of usage of our platform post migration. We have previously experienced customer loss in the process of integrating and migrating acquired companies for a variety of reasons. The pace and success rate of migration may be influenced by many factors, including the pace and quality of product development, our ability to operationally support the migrating creators and our adoption of business practices outside of our platform that matter to the creator.\nMoreover, we rely heavily on the representations and warranties and related indemnities provided to us by our acquired targets and their equity holders, including as they relate to creation, ownership and rights in intellectual property, compliance with laws, contractual requirements and the ability of the acquisition target to continue exploiting material intellectual property rights and technology after the acquisition. If any such representations are inaccurate or such warranties are breached, or if we are unable to fully exercise our indemnification rights, we may incur additional liabilities, disruptions to the operations of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s attention.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions, investments and significant commercial arrangements could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions, incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur payments system depends on third-party providers and is subject to risks that may harm our business.\nWe rely on third-party providers to support our payments system. Over 90% of revenue on our platform is associated with payments processed through our internal payment processing capabilities, called EPP. EPP uses a combination of multiple external vendors to provide a single, seamless payments option for creators and attendees. Beyond EPP, the remainder of creators\u2019 paid ticket sales are processed through linked, creator-owned, third-party accounts, including PayPal and Authorize.net, which we call Facilitated Payment Processing (FPP). We plan to transition creators to EPP and consider discontinuing FPP in the near- to medium-term (except in global markets where we do not support EPP). While we do not believe transitioning creators to EPP will have a material impact on creators' or consumers' user experience, it is possible that creators currently using FPP will choose to leave our platform rather than transition to EPP, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a complex, multi-vendor system with proprietary technology added, EPP relies on banks and third-party payment processors, including payment facilitators, to process payment transactions through various channels including by accessing various payment card networks. These features are designed to enable creators to manage payments in an easy and efficient manner. Any of our payment providers and vendors that do not operate well with our platform could adversely affect these payments services and, in turn, EPP and our business. We have multiple integrations in place at one time allowing for back up processing alternatives on EPP if a single provider is unable or unwilling to process any given transaction, payment method or currency. However, if any or some of these providers do not perform adequately, determine certain types of transactions as prohibitive for any reason or fail to identify fraud, if these providers\u2019 technology does not interoperate well with our platform, or if our relationships with these providers were to terminate unexpectedly, creators may find our platform more difficult to use and the ability of creators using our platform to sell tickets could be adversely affected, which could cause creators to use our platform less and harm our business.\nWe must also continually integrate various payment methods used both within the United States and internationally into EPP, including new features such as \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d functionality provided by third-party platforms. To enhance our acceptance in certain international markets we have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, locally-preferred payment methods and integrate such payment methods into EPP, which may increase our costs and also require us to understand and\nprotect against unique fraud and other risks associated with these payment methods. For example, in Brazil we localized our platform to allow the use of boleto banc\u00e1rio (bank slip) as a payment method, and we invested capital and management attention to achieve this. If we are not able to integrate new payment methods into EPP effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur payment processing partners require us to comply with payment card network operating rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules specific to the types of payments services that we support or couple interpret or re-interpret existing rules in ways that might restrict or prohibit us from providing or enabling certain payments services to creators, or could be costly or difficult to implement. We have agreed to reimburse our payment processors for fines they are assessed by payment card networks if we or creators using our platform are deemed to have violated these rules, including, for example, in the event that our processing of certain types of transactions is interpreted as a violation of applicable payment card network operating rules.\nIn addition, payment card networks and payment processing partners could increase the fees they charge us for their services, including in connection with an attendee\u2019s use of certain payment cards or other payment methods, which would increase our operating costs and reduce our margins. If we are unable to negotiate favorable economic terms with these partners, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nData loss or security breaches could harm our business, reputation, brand and results of operations.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have become more prevalent across industries and may occur on our systems or those of our third-party service providers or partners. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our third-party service providers and partners are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, hacking and other means of unauthorized access, denial of service and other attacks, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Attacks upon information technology systems are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. In addition to unauthorized access to or acquisition of personal data, confidential information, intellectual property or other sensitive information, such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware and ransomware, and may use a variety of methods, including denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means, to attain such unauthorized access or acquisition or otherwise affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Furthermore, the prevalent use of mobile devices increases the risk of data security incidents. In addition, misplaced, stolen or compromised mobile devices used at events for ticket scanning, or otherwise, could lead to unauthorized access to the device and data stored on or accessible through such device. We have in the past experienced breaches of our security measures, and our platform and systems are at risk for future breaches as a result of third-party action or employee, service provider, partner or contractor error or malfeasance. For example, in June 2018, we publicly announced that a criminal was able to penetrate the Ticketfly website and access certain consumer data, including names, email addresses, shipping addresses, billing addresses and phone numbers. We incurred costs related to responding to and remediating this incident and suffered a loss of revenue for the period during which the Ticketfly platform was disabled. This cyber incident delayed the completion of the integration of Ticketfly, which resulted in extended customer migration time and slower realization of synergies. We may be subject to litigation and experience reputational harm, and have been subject to claims and suffered customer loss, related to cybersecurity incidents. In the future, our financial performance may be impacted further if we face additional costs and expenses from customer compensation and retention incentives, creator loss, regulatory inquiries, litigation and further remediation and upgrades to our security infrastructure. Although we have insurance coverage, our policy may not cover all financial expenses related to cybersecurity incidents.\nIn addition, our platform involves the storage and transmission of personal information of users of our platform in our facilities and on our equipment, networks and internal or third-party systems. Security breaches could expose us to litigation, remediation costs, increased costs for security measures, loss of revenue, damage to our reputation and potential liability. User data and corporate systems and security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error or misconduct, malfeasance, a combination of these or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or data of creators and attendees. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, creators or attendees to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to creator or attendee data. We must continuously examine and modify our security controls and business policies to address the use of new devices and technologies, and the increasing focus by users and regulators on controlling and protecting user data. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against and remedy any potential security breaches and their consequences. Any security breach of our platform or systems, the\nsystems or networks of our third-party service providers or partners, or any unauthorized access to information we or our providers and partners process or maintain, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined or other future event and often are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we and our third-party service providers and partners may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. While we have implemented security measures intended to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures or our third-party service providers\u2019 and partners\u2019 security measures will successfully prevent service interruptions or further security incidents. Although it is difficult to determine what harm may directly result from any specific interruption or breach, any actual or perceived failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our network infrastructure, or of any third-party networks or systems used or supplied by our third-party service providers or partners, to the satisfaction of creators and attendees may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing creators and attendees and attract new creators and attendees.\nExamples of situations which have in the past and may in the future lead to unauthorized access of data may include:\n\u2022employees inadvertently sending financial information of one creator, attendee or employee to another creator, attendee or employee;\n\u2022employee malfeasance;\n\u2022creators\u2019 failure to properly password protect their leased ticket scanning and site operations devices leaving the data available to anyone using the device;\n\u2022a device stolen from an event and data access, alteration or acquisition occurring prior to our remote wiping of the data;\n\u2022an employee losing their computer or mobile device or otherwise, allowing for access to our email and/or administrative access, including access to guest lists to events;\n\u2022external breaches leading to the circulation of \u201cdark web\u201d lists of user name and password combinations openly vulnerable to attack without immediate detection;\n\u2022a hack of one of our databases;\n\u2022account takeovers;\n\u2022a hack of a third-party service provider\u2019s or partner\u2019s database; and\n\u2022unauthorized access to our offices or other properties.\nIf an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose creators and attendees or we could face lawsuits, regulatory investigations or other legal or regulatory proceedings and we could suffer financial exposure due to such events or in connection with regulatory fines, remediation efforts, investigation costs, changes or augmentation of our security measures and the expense of taking additional system protection measures.\nThe processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing applications of privacy regulations.\nWe receive, transmit and store a large volume of personal data and other user data. Numerous federal, state and international laws address privacy, data protection and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personal data and other user data. In the United States, numerous states already have, and are looking to expand, data protection legislation requiring companies like ours to consider solutions to meet differing needs and expectations of creators and attendees. For example, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses such as ours, and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur compliance related costs and expenses. The CCPA provides certain data privacy rights to California residents, such as affording consumers the right to opt out of certain sales of personal information and prohibits covered businesses from discriminating against consumers (e.g., charging more for services) for exercising any of their CCPA rights. The CCPA provides for potentially severe statutory penalties, and a private right of action for data breaches resulting from a failure to implement reasonable security procedures and practices. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) was recently voted into law by California residents. The CPRA significantly amends the CCPA and imposes additional data protection obligations on covered companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also creates a new California data protection agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which would likely result in increased regulatory scrutiny of California businesses in the areas of data protection and security. The substantive requirements for companies subject to the CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023. Moreover, the state of Nevada enacted a law that went into force on October 1, 2019 and requires companies to honor\nconsumers\u2019 requests to no longer sell their data. Violators may be subject to injunctions and civil penalties. Further, similar laws have passed in Virginia and Colorado, and have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. The enactment of such laws could have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging.\nAdditionally, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, \u201cHIPAA\u201d) governs the use, disclosure, and security of protected health information by HIPAA \u201ccovered entities\u201d and their \u201cbusiness associates,\u201d and subjects those \u201ccovered entities\u201d and their \u201cbusiness associates\u201d to certain privacy, security and breath notification regulations. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) (through the Office for Civil Rights) has direct enforcement authority over covered entities and business associates with regard to compliance with HIPAA regulations.\nIn early 2021, certain local health departments and other health care providers started using Eventbrite to schedule COVID-19 vaccine appointments. It is possible that some of these departments or providers are HIPAA covered entities, and they or their business associates are using Eventbrite services in ways that involve protected health information subject to HIPAA. As a result, Eventbrite may meet the definition of a business associate under HIPAA. On January 19, 2021, the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) for HHS, which is the HHS\u2019s enforcement authority, announced that it will exercise its enforcement discretion (Notification of Enforcement Discretion), retroactive to December 11, 2020, and will not impose penalties for violations of HIPAA on covered health care providers or their business associates in connection with the good faith use of online or web-based scheduling applications for the scheduling of individual appointments for COVID-19 vaccinations during the COVID-19 nationwide public health emergency, regardless of whether the vendor has actual or constructive knowledge that it meets the definition of a business associate under HIPAA.\nIf Eventbrite\u2019s activities were to fall outside the scope of the Notification of Enforcement Discretion, if the Notification of Enforcement Discretion were rescinded or if OCR were to interpret or apply the Notification of Enforcement Discretion in a manner inconsistent with our existing data management practices or product features, violations of the HIPAA provisions could result in civil and/or criminal penalties, including significant fines and up to 10 years in prison. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in, among other things, civil, criminal and contractual liability, fines, regulatory sanctions and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation.\nFurthermore, the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC) and many state Attorneys General continue to enforce federal and state consumer protection laws against companies for online collection, use, dissemination and security practices that appear to be unfair or deceptive. For example, according to the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers\u2019 personal information secure can constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company\u2019s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities.\nOutside the United States, personal data and other user data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. Foreign data protection, privacy, information security, user protection and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the United States. In particular, the European Union and the European Economic Area (EEA) and their member states traditionally have taken broad views as to types of data that are subject to privacy and data protection laws and regulations, and have imposed greater legal obligations on companies in this regard. In the EEA, we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR), which applies to any company established in the EEA as well as to those outside the EEA if they collect and use personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to individuals in the EEA or the monitoring of their behavior. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, mandatory data breach notification requirements and onerous new obligations on services providers.\nFurther, following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the expiry of the transition period, from January 1, 2021, we have to comply with the GDPR as implemented in the United Kingdom, which together with the amended United Kingdom Data Protection Act 2018 (together, the UK GDPR), retains in large part the GDPR in United Kingdom national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, e.g. we could be fined up to the greater of \u20ac20 million/\u00a317.5 million or 4% of global turnover under each regime. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how United Kingdom data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term following the UK government\u2019s recent consultation on proposals for wide-ranging reform to the UK GDPR, and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom\nwill be regulated in the long term after expiry of the EU-UK adequacy decision in June 2025. These changes may lead to additional compliance costs and could increase our overall risk exposure.\nIn addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. For example, on September 18, 2020, Brazil enacted a data protection law which imposes strict obligations related to data processing that are similar to those in the GDPR. The penalties for non-compliance with this law will become applicable on August 1, 2021 and allow for, among other corrective measures, fines of up to R$50 million per violation. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of personal data, such as healthcare data or other sensitive information, could greatly increase our cost of providing our products and services, require significant changes to our operations or even prevent us from offering certain services in jurisdictions in which we operate.\nRecent legal developments in Europe have created complexity and uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States. For example, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework (Privacy Shield) under which personal data could be transferred from the EEA to United States entities which had self-certified under the Privacy Shield scheme. While the CJEU upheld the adequacy of an alternative mechanism, the standard contractual clauses (a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism), it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. Use of the standard contractual clauses must now be assessed on a case-by-case basis taking into account the legal regime applicable in the destination country, in particular applicable surveillance laws and rights of individuals and additional measures and/or contractual provisions may need to be put in place, however, the nature of these additional measures is currently uncertain. Additionally, the European Commission has published revised standard contractual clauses for data transfers from the EEA: the revised clauses must be used for relevant new data transfers from September 27, 2021; existing standard contractual clauses arrangements must be migrated to the revised clauses by December 27, 2022. The revised standard contractual clauses apply only to the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA and not the United Kingdom; the UK\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office launched a public consultation on its draft revised data transfers mechanisms in August 2021. These recent developments will require us to review and amend the legal mechanisms by which we transfer and/or receive personal data to/from the United States. As supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances where the standard contractual clauses cannot be used, or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn addition, the EU Commission has proposed a new ePrivacy Regulation that would address various matters, including provisions specifically aimed at the use of cookies to identify an individual\u2019s online behavior, and any such ePrivacy Regulation may provide for new compliance obligations and significant penalties. While the text of the ePrivacy Regulation is still under development, recent European court decisions and regulators\u2019 recent guidance, are driving increased attention to cookies and tracking technologies. For example, in December 2020 the French data protection regulator (the CNIL) imposed fines of EUR 100 million and EUR 35 million respectively against certain entities for alleged breaches of cookies consent and transparency requirements; and in December 2021, the CNIL imposed fines of EUR 150 million and EUR 60 million against certain entities for alleged failures to allow users to easily reject cookies. Any of these changes to European data protection law or its interpretation, including if the trend of increasing enforcement by regulators of the strict approach in recent guidance and decisions continues, could disrupt and harm our business.\nThe interpretation and application of many privacy and data protection laws are, and will likely remain, uncertain, and it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or product features. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits and other claims and penalties, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our products, which could harm our business. In addition to government regulation, privacy advocacy and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us. Any inability to adequately address privacy, data protection and data security concerns or comply with applicable privacy, data protection or data security laws, regulations, policies and other obligations could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and harm our business.\nOur acquisition strategy to date, and going forward, often results in the winding down of the acquired platforms over a lengthy period of time while the existing creators migrate to our platform. The focus often shifts away from these legacy platforms to meeting the needs of migrated creators on our platform. The existence of these legacy platforms within a shifting landscape regarding privacy, data protection and data security may result in regulatory liability or exposure to fines. A significant data incident on a legacy platform may harm our reputation and our brand and may adversely affect the migration of existing creators to our platform. See the risk factor above titled \u201cData loss or security breaches could harm our business, reputation, brand and results of operations\u201d for information regarding the Ticketfly cyber incident. We may also become exposed to potential liabilities and our attention and resources may be diverted as a result of differing privacy regulations pertaining to our applications.\nAny failure(s) by us and/or various third-party service providers and partners with which we do business, to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state or similar international laws and regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personal data or other user data, or the perception that any such failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, result in a loss of creators or attendees, discourage potential creators and attendees from trying our platform and/or result in fines and/or proceedings by governmental agencies and/or users, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, ongoing compliance with evolving interpretation of the GDPR and UK GDPR and other regulatory requirements requires time and resources and a review of the technology and systems currently in use against the requirements of GDPR and UK GDPR and other regulations.\nThe reputation and brand of our platform is important to our success, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand as a differentiated and category-defining ticketing company serving creators and attendees is critical to our relationship with our existing creators and to our ability to attract new creators and attendees. The successful promotion of our brand attributes will depend on a number of factors that we control and some factors outside of our control.\nThe promotion of our brand requires us to make substantial expenditures and management investment, which will increase as our market becomes more competitive and as we seek to expand our platform. To the extent that these activities yield increased revenue, this revenue may not offset the increased expenses we incur. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand and successfully differentiate our platform from competitive products and services, our business may not grow, we may not be able to compete effectively and we could lose creators or fail to attract potential creators, all of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we must continue to make substantial efforts and investments to be associated with events that are positively viewed by other creators and attendees.\nHowever, there are also factors outside of our control, which could undermine our reputation and harm our brand. Negative perception of our platform may harm our business, including as a result of complaints or negative publicity about us or creators; the hosting of COVID-19 \"superspreader\" events on our platform; our inability to timely comply with local laws, regulations and/or consumer protection related guidance; the use of our platform for fraudulent events; events being unsuccessful, either as a result of lack of attendance or attendee experience not meeting expectations; responsiveness to issues or complaints and timing of refunds and/or reversal of payments on our platform (chargebacks); actual or perceived disruptions or defects in our platform; security incidents; or lack of awareness of our policies or changes to our policies that creators, attendees or others perceive as overly restrictive, unclear or inconsistent with our values.\nFurthermore, creators use our platform for events that represent a variety of views, activities and interests, some of which many other creators or attendees do not agree with or find offensive, or are illegal, or are perceived as such. For example, in the past, creators have tried to use our platform for events related to illegal activity and extreme activist groups. These events may cause negative publicity and harm our reputation and brand. Some creators may not have, or are perceived not to have, legal and ethical business practices. Although we maintain procedures and policies, both automated and by human review, to prevent the usage of our platform for such purposes and to prevent such practices, our procedures and policies may not effectively reduce or eliminate the use of our platform by such creators. In addition, certain creators or attendees may not agree with our decision to restrict certain creators from using our platform or the promotion of certain events on our platform. If our platform is associated with illegal or offensive activity or creators and attendees disagree with our decision to restrict certain creators or events, our reputation and brand may be harmed and our ability to attract and retain creators will be adversely impacted.\nIf we are unable to maintain a reputable platform that provides valuable solutions and desirable events, then our ability to attract and retain creators and attendees could be impaired and our reputation, brand and business could be harmed.\nOur platform might be used for illegal or improper purposes, all of which could expose us to additional liability and harm our business.\nOur platform remains susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses by creators or attendees. Illegal or improper uses of our platform may include money laundering, terrorist financing, drug trafficking, illegal online gaming, other online scams, illegal sexually-oriented services, phishing and identity theft, prohibited sales of pharmaceuticals, fraudulent sale of goods or services, posting of unauthorized intellectual property, unauthorized uses of credit and debit cards or bank accounts and similar misconduct. Creators may also encourage, promote, facilitate or instruct others to engage in illegal activities. Despite measures we have taken to detect and lessen the risk of this kind of conduct, we cannot guarantee that these measures will stop all illegal or improper uses of our platform and such uses have occurred in the past. Our business could be harmed if creators use our system for illegal or improper purposes, which may expose us to liability. At the same time, if the measures we have taken to guard against these activities are too restrictive and inadvertently screen proper transactions, or if we are unable to apply and communicate these measures fairly and transparently, or we are perceived to have failed to do so, this could diminish the experience of creators and attendees, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCreators rely on third-party platforms, such as Facebook and Spotify, to connect with and attract attendees and we depend on our platform of partners and developers to create applications that will integrate with our platform.\nOur platform interoperates with other third-party distributors, such as Facebook and Spotify. Attendees are able to access our platform and purchase tickets through these third-party services. Creators are able to publicize their events and sell tickets on these third-party sites. The interoperability of our platform with these other sites allows creators to reach more attendees and makes our platform more appealing to creators. These third-party partners have in the past, and may in the future, terminate their relationship with us, fail to maintain integrations, limit certain integration functionality, change their treatment of our services or restrict access to their platform by creators at any time. For example, in the past, Facebook removed a feature of its service that allowed creators to include multiple hosts on a single event seamlessly across platforms, which negatively impacted certain music creators\u2019 use of the Facebook integration with our platform. If any such third-party services become incompatible with our platform or the use of our platform and solutions on such third-party platforms are restricted in the future, our business will be harmed.\nIn addition, to the extent that Google, Facebook or other leading large technology companies that have a significant presence in our key markets disintermediate ticketing or event management providers, whether by offering their own comprehensive event-focused or shopping capabilities, or by referring leads to suppliers, other favored partners or themselves directly, there could be harm to our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also depend on our platform of integrated product partners connecting through our API to create applications that will integrate with our platform, such as Salesforce, HubSpot and MailChimp, and to allow them to integrate with our solutions. This presents certain risks to our business, including:\n\u2022our inability to provide any assurance that these third-party applications and products meet the same quality and security standards that we apply to our own development efforts, and to the extent that they contain bugs or defects, they may create disruptions in the use of our platform by creators or negatively affect our brand;\n\u2022our lack of support for software applications developed by our developer partners, which could cause creators and attendees to be left without support and consequently could cease using our services if these developers do not provide adequate support for their applications;\n\u2022our inability to assure that our partners will be able to successfully integrate with our products or that our partners will continue to do so;\n\u2022our inability to confirm if our partners comply with all applicable laws and regulations; and\n\u2022the risk that these partners and developers may not possess the appropriate intellectual property rights to develop and share their applications.\nMany of these risks are not within our control to prevent, and our brand may be damaged if these applications do not perform to the satisfaction of creators and attendees and that dissatisfaction is attributed to us.\nChanges in Internet search engine algorithms and dynamics, search engine disintermediation, changes in marketplace rules or changes in privacy and consumer data access could have a negative impact on traffic for our sites or functionality of our product and ultimately, our business and results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on Internet search engines, such as Google, to generate traffic to our websites, principally through free or organic searches. Search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user\u2019s search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our websites can be negatively affected. In addition, a search engine could, for competitive or other purposes, alter its search algorithms or results causing our websites to place lower in organic search query results. If a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking of our websites or those of our partners, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be harmed. Furthermore, our failure to successfully manage our search engine optimization could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to our websites, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic, which may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe also rely on application marketplaces, such as Apple\u2019s App Store and Google\u2019s Play, to drive downloads of our applications. Such marketplaces have in the past made, and may in the future make, changes to their marketplaces that make access to our products more difficult. For example, our applications may receive unfavorable treatment compared to the promotion and placement of competing applications, such as the order in which they appear within marketplaces. Further, Apple introduced commission fees as part of its App Store rules that would have required us to start paying fees on in-app purchases of tickets to online events. To avoid paying high commission fees, we removed paid online events from our mobile product, which may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Similarly, if problems arise in our relationships with providers of application marketplaces, traffic to our site and our user growth could be harmed.\nIn addition, changes to third parties\u2019 privacy and consumer data access policies have in the past, and may in the future, negatively impact the functionality of our product. For example, in late 2021, Apple and Facebook made a series of policy changes that significantly impacted the ability of advertisers, including creators using Boost, to target ads. In response to these changes, we launched a new dynamic events product in November 2021, although there can be no assurances that this product will effectively address these third party policy changes or the extent to which it will do so. Such third parties\u2019 changes may render our products less effective, obsolete or require us to divert engineering resources to retool our products rather than releasing new functionality. This may ultimately harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not manage the risks of operating internationally effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nIn 2021 and 2020 we derived 24% and 31%, respectively, of our net revenue from outside of the United States. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented a restructuring plan, which included the reduction of offices outside of the United States. We currently have various offices outside the United States, including offices in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Australia and Argentina, and we plan to establish a talent hub in India in 2022. We have concentrated engineering and business development teams in Argentina and Spain. Our international operations and results are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022currency exchange restrictions or costs and exchange rate fluctuations, particularly in Argentina, and the risks and costs inherent in hedging such exposures;\n\u2022new and modified laws and regulations regarding data privacy, data protection, ticketing and information security;\n\u2022exposure to local economic or political instability, threatened or actual acts of terrorism and violence and changes in the rights of individuals to assemble, including challenges attracting and retaining talent in Argentina as a result of hyperinflation;\n\u2022exposure to regional or global public health concerns, epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022compliance with U.S. and non-U.S. regulations, laws and requirements relating to anti-corruption, antitrust or competition, economic sanctions, data content and privacy, consumer protection, employment and labor laws, health and safety and advertising and promotions;\n\u2022compliance with additional U.S. laws applicable to U.S. companies operating internationally and interpretations of U.S. and international tax laws;\n\u2022weaker enforcement of our contractual and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022preferences by local populations for local providers;\n\u2022laws and business practices that favor local competitors or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain businesses; and\n\u2022slower adoption of the Internet as a ticketing, advertising and commerce medium, which could limit our ability to migrate international operations to our existing systems.\nDespite our experience operating internationally, any future expansion efforts into new countries may not be successful. Our international expansion has placed, and any future international growth may increasingly place, a significant strain on our management, customer service, product development, sales and marketing, administrative, financial and other resources. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required in expanding our international operations will be successful or produce desired levels of revenue or profitability in a timely manner, or at all. Furthermore, certain international markets in which we operate have lower margins than more mature markets, which could have a negative impact on our margins as our revenue from these markets grows over time.\nWe may choose in certain instances to localize our platform to the unique circumstances of such countries and markets in order to achieve market acceptance, which can be complex, difficult and costly and divert management and personnel resources. Our failure to adapt our practices, platform, systems, processes and contracts effectively to the creator and attendee preferences or customs of each country into which we expand could slow our growth. If we are unable to manage our international growth successfully, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nThe pricing of our packages may affect our ability to attract or retain creators.\nOur event creators can select from different pricing packages based on the features required, service level desired and budget. We assess our pricing packages based on prior experience, feedback from creators and data insights, and we periodically adjust the price of our packages. Creators\u2019 price sensitivity may vary by location, and as we expand into different countries, our pricing packages may not enable us to compete effectively in these countries. In addition, if our platform or services change, then we may need to, or choose to, revise our pricing. Such changes to our pricing model or our ability to efficiently price our packages and solution could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition and impact our ability to predict our future performance.\nA significant number of our employees are located in Argentina, and any favorable or unfavorable developments in Argentina could have an impact on our results of operations.\nA significant number of our employees, including engineers, are located in Argentina, and therefore, a portion of our operating expenses are denominated in Argentine pesos. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 147 employees located in Argentina, of which 108 are engineers. If high inflation rates together with current foreign exchange currency controls continue, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations as it would increase our operating expenses. Our business activities in Argentina also subject us to risks associated with changes in and interpretations of Argentine law, including laws related to employment, the protection and ownership of intellectual property and U.S. ownership of Argentine operations. Furthermore, if we had to scale down or close our Argentine operations, there would be significant time and cost required to relocate those operations elsewhere, which could have an adverse impact on our overall cost structure.\nThe Argentine government has historically exercised significant influence over the country\u2019s economy. For example, on September 1, 2019, the Argentine government enacted foreign exchange currency controls. These controls include restrictions on Argentine citizens and Argentinian companies\u2019 abilities to purchase U.S. dollars, transfer money to foreign accounts and make payments of dividends or payments for services by related parties without permission from the Argentine government. These controls have become stricter during the pandemic; currently it is not possible for citizens in Argentina to formally access the exchange market, and strategies available for the purchase of foreign currency outside of the exchange market are largely cost prohibitive. This situation has rendered it more difficult to fund our operations in Argentina, including cash compensation programs for our employees based there. We are also currently unable to offer our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) program to our employees in Argentina. The increase of the local inflation rates and the local currency devaluation have exacerbated these issues, drastically reducing the purchasing power of our local employees\u2019 salaries, including because the purchase of certain goods and services in Argentina remains tied to the market value of the US dollar. In addition, it is possible that the Argentine government may impose additional controls on the foreign exchange market and on capital flows from and into Argentina in response to capital flight or depreciation of the Argentine peso. These restrictions may have a negative effect on the economy and harm our business if imposed in an economic environment where access to local capital is tightly constrained.\nAdditionally, Argentina\u2019s economy and legal and regulatory framework have at times suffered radical changes, due to significant political influence and uncertainties. Currently, Argentina's federal government and certain provinces are conducting negotiations with respect to the restructuring of their sovereign debt. Such policies, and the ongoing restructuring negotiations, could destabilize the country and adversely affect our business and operating expenses.\nMoreover, due to the effects of the pandemic, employment contract terminations were prohibited during most of 2020 and 2021. For the first half of 2022, terminations are permissible with the inclusion of extra severance payments. The possibility of additional prohibitions on terminations, or the extension of the increase in requisite severance payments, could affect our ability to terminate employees or restructure our Argentinian operations.\nDoing business in Argentina poses additional challenges, such as finding and retaining qualified employees, particularly management-level employees, navigating local bureaucracy and infrastructure-related issues and identifying and retaining qualified service providers, among other risks. Among these, the ability to retain employees without the possibility to offer alternatives that enable them to regain their salary value have been particularly challenging, and said difficulties are expected to continue or even increase. Argentina's fragile economic environment is currently challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic. The long-term effects to the Argentine economy of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic are difficult to assess or predict, and may include risks to citizens\u2019 health and safety, as well as reduced economic activity and employment liberties limitations. From March 2020 through December 2021, the Argentine government introduced several measures designed to address the COVID-19 pandemic, which so far have resulted in a significant slowdown in economic activity that adversely affected economic growth in 2020 and will potentially adversely affect economic growth in 2022 and cannot be currently quantified. Furthermore, despite recent enactments of local anti-corruption and anti-bribery legislation in a number of developing markets such as Argentina, it may still be more common than in the United States for others to engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act or similar local anti-bribery laws. In turn, the decrease in investors\u2019 confidence, among other factors, could have a significant adverse impact on the development of the Argentine economy, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our commitment to legal compliance could put us at a competitive disadvantage, and any lapses in our compliance could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur metrics and estimates are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in those metrics may seriously harm and negatively affect our reputation and our business.\nWe regularly review metrics to evaluate growth trends, measure our performance, and make strategic decisions. These metrics are calculated using internal company data and have not been validated by an independent third party. Errors or inaccuracies in our metrics or data could result in incorrect business decisions and inefficiencies. Furthermore, if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics, we may not be able to accurately assess the health of our business and our reputation and our business may be harmed.\nCreator and attendee acquisition and retention depend upon effective interoperation with operating systems, networks, protocols, devices, web browsers and standards that we do not control.\nWe make our platform available across a variety of operating systems and web browsers. We are dependent on the interoperability of our platform with popular devices, mobile operating systems and web browsers that we do not control, such as Android, iOS, Chrome and Firefox. In addition we are dependent on protocols like email and push notification to communicate with our customers. Any changes, bugs or technical issues in such systems, devices, protocols or web browsers that degrade the functionality of our platform, make it difficult for creators or attendees to access or use our platform, impose fees related to our platform or give preferential treatment to competitive products or services could adversely affect usage of our platform. In the event that it is difficult for creators or attendees to access and use our platform, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nOur failure to successfully address the evolving market for transactions on mobile devices and to build mobile products could harm our business.\nA significant and growing portion of creators and attendees access our platform through mobile devices. The number of people who access the Internet and purchase goods and services through mobile devices, including smartphones and handheld tablets or computers, has increased significantly in the past few years and is expected to continue to increase. If we are not able to provide creators and attendees with the experience and solutions they want on mobile devices, our business may be harmed.\nWhile we have created mobile applications and versions of much of our web content, if these mobile applications and versions are not well received by creators and attendees, our business may suffer. In addition, we face different fraud risks and regulatory risks from transactions sent from mobile devices than we do from personal computers. If we are unable to effectively anticipate and manage these risks, our business and results of operations may be harmed.\nWe rely on software and services licensed from other parties. Defects in or the loss of software or services from third parties could increase our costs and adversely affect the quality of our service.\nComponents of our platform include various types of software and services licensed from unaffiliated third parties. Our business would be disrupted if any of the software or services we license from others or functional equivalents thereof were either no longer available to us or no longer offered on commercially reasonable terms. In either case, we would be required to either redesign our platform to function with software or services available from other parties or develop these components ourselves, which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in the release of new solutions and services on our platform. Furthermore, we might be forced to limit the features available in our platform due to changes by our third-party software and service providers. In addition, if we fail to maintain or renegotiate any of these software or service licenses, we could face significant delays and diversion of resources in attempting to license and integrate functional equivalents.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, generate reduced revenue and incur costly litigation to protect our rights.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon protecting our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in our platform. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. While we take precautions, it may still be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our technology and use our proprietary information to create solutions and services that compete with ours. Some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer and disclosure of our technology may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries. Further, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our technology and proprietary information may increase.\nIt is our policy to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and to enter into confidentiality agreements with the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances. No assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to, and use and distribution of, our platform and proprietary information. Further, these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our platform or solutions.\nIn order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our platform or solutions, impair the functionality of our platform or solutions, delay introductions of enhancements to our platform, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform or solutions, or injure our reputation. In addition, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new features in our platform or solutions, and we cannot assure you that we could license that technology on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to license such technology on commercially reasonable terms could adversely affect our ability to compete, and harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe use open source software in our platform, which could subject us to litigation or other actions.\nWe use open source software in our platform and may use more open source software in the future. The terms of many open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, harm our business, results of operations or financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our platform. In addition, if we were to combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software. If we inappropriately use open source software, we may be required to re-engineer our platform, discontinue the sale of our platform or take other remedial actions. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of\ncertain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected if we are subject to a protracted infringement claim or a claim that results in a significant damage award.\nThere is considerable patent and other intellectual property development activity in our industry. Our success depends on our not infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities, including non-practicing entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property rights relating to our industry and may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities, have claimed and may in the future claim that our products or technologies may infringe their intellectual property rights and may assert patent, copyright, trade secret and other claims based on intellectual property rights against us and our customers, suppliers and channel partners. A claim may also be made relating to technology or intellectual property rights that we acquire or license from third parties. If we were subject to a claim of infringement, regardless of the merit of the claim or our defenses, the claim could:\n\u2022require costly litigation to resolve and the payment of substantial damages;\n\u2022require significant management time;\n\u2022cause us to enter into unfavorable royalty or license agreements;\n\u2022require us to discontinue the sale of products and solutions through our platform;\n\u2022require us to indemnify creators or third-party service providers or partners; and/or\n\u2022require us to expend additional development resources to redesign our platform.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.\nFollowing a national referendum and enactment of legislation by the government of the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union and ratified a trade and cooperation agreement governing its future relationship with the European Union. The agreement, which is being applied provisionally from January 1, 2021 until it is ratified by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, addresses trade, economic arrangements, law enforcement, judicial cooperation and a governance framework including procedures for dispute resolution, among other things. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal. These developments, or the perception that any related developments could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity, restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets or restrict our access to capital. For example, disruptions and uncertainty caused by the withdrawal may cause consumers to reduce their discretionary spending. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reduce the price of our Class A common stock.\nOur failure to comply with the various export controls and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations to which we are subject could subject us to liability, including civil and criminal penalties,or restrictions on sales.\nWe are subject to U.S. economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations, such as those that are administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Such laws and regulations prohibit or restrict transactions and dealings involving specified countries, their governments, and certain individuals and entities, including those that are specially designated sanctions targets, or majority-owned by the same (collectively, Sanctions). As federal, state and foreign legislative regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions in these areas increase, we expect our compliance costs to increase, perhaps substantially. Failure to comply with any of these requirements could result in the limitation, suspension or termination of our platform, imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties, including fines, and/or the seizure and/or forfeiture of our assets, as well as reputational harm. While we endeavor to conduct our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance with Sanctions, we cannot guarantee that these measures will be fully effective in ensuring compliance and preventing violations in the future, particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to change. The development, implementation and maintenance of Sanctions compliance policies and procedures may be time-consuming or result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities or impose other costs.\nFurther, our products incorporate encryption technology. These encryption products may be exported from the United States only with the required export authorizations, including by a license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations. Such products may also be subject to certain regulatory reporting requirements. Various countries also regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our customers\u2019 ability to import our services into those countries. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and of exports and imports of encryption products, or our failure to obtain required approval for our products and services, when applicable, could subject us to legal penalties, harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenue. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements regarding the provision of our products and services, including with respect to new products and services, may delay the introduction of our products and services in various markets or, in some cases, prevent the provision of our products and services to some countries altogether.\nAny change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with those laws and regulations could harm our business.\nWe are subject to a number of U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. For example, our platform is subject to an increasingly strict set of legal and regulatory requirements intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud and other illicit activity. The interpretation of those requirements by judges, regulatory bodies and enforcement agencies is changing, often quickly and with little notice. Changes in laws and regulations could impose more stringent requirements on us to detect and prevent illegal and improper activity by creators, which can increase our operating costs and reduce our margins. For example, to date, in the United States, platforms like ours are immune from liability resulting from the improper or illegal actions facilitated by the platform, but initiated by its users, under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA). If the CDA is amended in a manner that reduces protections for our platform, we will need to increase our content moderation operations, which may harm our results of operations.\nIn addition, the ticketing business is subject to many laws and regulations, both foreign and domestic. These laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may sometimes conflict. Outside of ticketing regulations, creators are often subject to regulations of their own, such as permitting and crowd control requirements. Regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we are responsible for ensuring that creators comply with these laws and regulations, which could greatly increase our compliance costs, expose us to litigation, subject us to fines and penalties and otherwise harm our business.\nFailure to comply with anti-corruption, anti-bribery and similar laws associated with our activities outside of the United States could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (FCPA), the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010 (Bribery Act), and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws in various jurisdictions, both domestic and abroad, where we conduct business. The FCPA and the Bribery Act prohibit us and our officers, directors, employees and business partners acting on our behalf, including agents, from, directly or indirectly, corruptly offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to a \u201cforeign official\u201d for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA further requires us to make and keep books, records and accounts that accurately reflect transactions and dispositions of assets and to maintain a system of adequate internal accounting controls. The Bribery Act also prohibits private-sector bribery, and accepting bribes. Our sales team sells use of our platform abroad, and we face significant risks if we fail to comply with the FCPA and other applicable anti-corruption laws. We operate in many jurisdictions around the world and may also have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, service providers and agents, even if we do not authorize such activities. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot ensure that all of our employees and agents, as well as those contractors to which we outsource certain of our business operations, will not take actions in violation of our policies or agreements and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible.\nAny violation of the FCPA, the Bribery Act or other applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws could subject us to significant sanctions, including civil or criminal fines and penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions and debarment from government contracts, as well as related stockholder lawsuits and other remedial measures, all of which could harm our\nreputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Responding to any investigation may result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nFailure to comply with applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations could harm our business and result of operations.\nAny perceived or actual breach of compliance by us with respect to anti-money laundering (AML) laws, rules, and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act, USA Patriot Act and Title 18 U.S.C. Sections 1956-57 and 1960, could have a significant impact on our reputation and could cause us to lose existing creators and attendees, prevent us from obtaining new creators, require us to expend significant funds to address civil and criminal enforcement arising out of alleged violations and to avert further potential violations and expose us to legal risk and potential liability that could have a material effect on our business. Moreover, many states have their own AML legal regulatory regimes and interpretations and applications of those legal principles are complex and varied. Several of these state and federal laws require companies including those that are characterized as a money services business or money transmitter, to adopt an AML compliance program that meets certain enumerated requirements to address the risk of a service being use for illegal or illicit activity. While we maintain that we are not a money services business or money transmitter, we have voluntarily elected to develop a compliance program to mitigate the risk of our platform being used for illegal or illicit activity and to help detect and prevent fraud. Nevertheless, if the federal government or any state government took the position that we were a money services business or money transmitter, they could require us to register as such, modify or enhance our existing AML compliance program, and obtain a money transmitter license.\nFurthermore, if a federal or state regulator makes a determination that we have operated as an unlicensed money services business or money transmitter, we could be subject to civil and criminal fines, penalties, costs, legal fees, reputational damage or other negative consequences, all of which may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations related to payments could harm our business and results of operations.\nThe laws and regulations related to payments are complex, subject to change, and vary across different jurisdictions in the United States and globally. Furthermore, changes in laws, rules and regulations have occurred and may occur in the future, which may impact our business practices. In particular, in the United States, certain state jurisdictions require a money transmission license to provide certain payments services, and the applicability of state money transmission licensing laws to payment processing services such as those we provide is a matter of regulatory interpretation that is subject to change. In this regard, changes to regulatory interpretations or decisions by applicable authorities that certain of our activities should be subject to regulation under state money transmission licensing laws could subject us to investigation and the potential for resulting liability. As a result of regulatory uncertainty with respect to state money transmission licensing and regulation and federal money services business registration, we are required to spend significant time and effort to address compliance with those laws and regulations and to ensure that creators and attendees are complying with those laws and regulations. Any failure or claim of our failure to comply, or any failure by our third-party service providers or partners to comply, with such laws and regulations or other requirements could divert substantial resources, result in liabilities or force us to restructure or even to stop offering EPP, which will harm our business and results of operations.\nFor example, if we are deemed to be a money transmitter as defined by applicable regulation, we could be subject to certain laws, rules and regulations enforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States and numerous state and local agencies who may define money transmitter differently. If we were required to be licensed as a money transmitter (or otherwise determined that obtaining state money transmission licenses would further our business purposes), we would be subject to recordkeeping and reporting requirements, as well as bonding requirements, restrictions on the use of customer funds and other obligations. We would also be subject to examination and oversight by applicable state licensing authorities.\nAdditionally, outside of the United States, we could be subject to additional laws, rules and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial services, and as we expand into new jurisdictions, the foreign regulations and regulators governing our business that we are subject to will expand as well. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulation and we are not in compliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties in one or more jurisdictions levied by federal or state or local regulators, including state Attorneys General, as well as those levied by foreign regulators. In addition to fines, penalties for failing to comply with applicable rules and regulations could include criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make changes to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny.\nAdditionally, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), and if we experience substantial losses related to payment card transactions or in the event of noncompliance with the PCI-DSS, we may choose to, or be required to, cease accepting certain payment cards for payment. If we were unable to accept payment cards through EPP,\ncreators would be required to use third-party payment options, which would reduce the simplicity and ease-of-use of our platform.\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations, and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. For example, as a result of our adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASC 842) which was effective for us beginning January 1, 2019, there was an increase of $3.7 million in operating lease expense related to the accounting treatment of our San Francisco office lease, which was accounted for as a build-to-suit lease under ASC 840 prior to the adoption of ASC 842.\nIf currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future, our results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected.\nOur international operations expose us to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Many of our creators live or operate outside the United States, and therefore we have significant ticket sales denominated in foreign currencies, most notably the British Pound, Euro, Canadian Dollar, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real and Argentinian Peso. If currency exchange rates remain at current levels, currency translation could continue to negatively affect net revenue growth for events that are not listed in U.S. dollars and could also reduce the demand for U.S. dollar denominated events from attendees outside of the United States. Further, we incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our international locations in the local currency. Because we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could harm our results of operations.\nOur business may be subject to sales tax and other indirect taxes in various jurisdictions. In addition, creators may also be subject to certain taxes.\nThe application of indirect taxes, such as sales and use tax, amusement tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipts tax, to businesses like ours and to creators and attendees is a complex and evolving issue. Significant judgment is required to evaluate applicable tax obligations and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our business.\nOne or more states, localities, the federal government or other countries may seek to impose additional reporting, record-keeping or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours that facilitate online commerce. For example, taxing authorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to calculate, collect and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the Internet, and are considering related legislation. An increasing number of jurisdictions have enacted laws or are considering enacting laws requiring marketplaces to report user activity or collect and remit taxes on certain items sold on the marketplace. Imposition of an information reporting or tax collection requirement could decrease creator or attendee activity on our platform, which would harm our business. New legislation could require us or creators to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated with tax calculation, collection and remittance and audit requirements, which could make using our platform less attractive and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe face sales and use tax and value-added tax audits in certain states and international jurisdictions and it is possible that we could face additional sales and use tax and value-added tax audits in the future in additional jurisdictions and that our liability for these taxes could exceed our reserves as state or international tax authorities could assert that we are obligated to collect additional amounts as taxes from creators and remit those taxes to those authorities. We could also be subject to audits and assessments with respect to state, local and international jurisdictions for which we have not accrued tax liabilities. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales or other taxes on our services in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so and do not accrue for sales or other taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, discourage creators from using our platform or otherwise harm our business and results of operations. Although we have reserved for potential payments of possible past tax liabilities in our financial statements as disclosed in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial statements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition will be harmed.\nOur international operations subject us to potential adverse tax consequences and additional taxes.\nWe generally conduct our international operations through wholly owned subsidiaries and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. Because of these international operations, we may be subject to adverse tax changes or interpretation, increased taxes due to increased international expansion, and tax charges due to complex intercompany agreements.\nWe may be subject to income or other indirect taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations. In addition, the authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns and impose additional tax, interest and penalties, and the authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us, any of which could have a negative impact on us or our results of operations. As we earn an increasing portion of our revenue and accumulate a greater portion of our cash flow in foreign jurisdictions, we could face a higher effective tax rate and incremental cash tax payments.\nAdditionally, our intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position was not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates and reduced cash flows and may harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally, a greater than 50 percentage point change in our equity ownership by certain stockholders or groups of stockholders) is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. We have undergone ownership changes in the past, which have resulted in limitations on our ability to utilize our NOLs, and future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. The existing NOLs of some of our subsidiaries may be subject to limitations arising from ownership changes prior to, or in connection with, their acquisition by us. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that, due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, including for state tax purposes. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize some portion of our NOLs even if we attain profitability.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. We have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business, including increased complexity resulting from our international expansion. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could also adversely affect the results of management reports and independent registered public accounting firm audits of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports that we file with the SEC. While our management has previously been, and will continue in the future to be, required to perform an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm was not required to perform such an evaluation prior to the year ended December 31, 2019, which is the date we were no longer an emerging growth company. Accordingly, we are required to include in each of\nour Annual Reports on Form 10-K an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered accounting firm. There can be no assurance that we or our independent registered auditors will not in the future identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which may have a negative impact on our ability to timely and accurately produce financial statements or which may negatively impact the confidence level of our stockholders and other market participants with respect to our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the NYSE.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business future prospects and increases the risk of your investment.\nWe launched operations in 2006. This limited history in an evolving industry makes it difficult to effectively assess or forecast our future prospects. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we encounter or may encounter. These risks and difficulties include our ability to cost-effectively acquire new creators and engage and retain existing creators, maintain the quality of our technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle ticket sales and event management services globally and the deployment of new features and solutions and successfully compete with other companies that are currently in, or may enter, the ticketing and event solution space. Additional risks include our ability to effectively manage growth, responsibly use the data that creators and attendees share with us, process, store, protect and use personal data in compliance with governmental regulation, contractual obligations and other legal obligations related to privacy and security and avoid interruptions or disruptions in our service or slower than expected load times for our platform. Other risks posed by our limited operating history include the ability to hire, integrate and retain world class talent at all levels of our company, continue to expand our business in markets outside the United States, and defend ourselves against litigation, regulatory, intellectual property, privacy or other claims. If we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above, our business and our results of operations will be harmed.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nPrior to our initial public offering, there was no public market for shares of our Class A common stock. The market prices of the securities of other newly public companies have historically been highly volatile. The market price of our Class A common stock has in the past, and may in the future, fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022overall performance of the equity markets and/or publicly-listed technology companies;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our net revenue or other operating metrics;\n\u2022changes in the financial projections we provide to the public or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet the estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022the economy as a whole and market conditions in our industry;\n\u2022rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022recruitment or departure of key personnel; and\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war, public health concerns and epidemics, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.\nIn addition, extreme price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected and continue to affect many technology companies\u2019 stock prices. Often, their stock prices have fluctuated in ways unrelated or disproportionate to the companies\u2019 operating performance. The global stock markets have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the price of our Class A common stock has been volatile and has decreased significantly in recent months. The COVID-19 pandemic and the significant uncertainties it has caused for the global\neconomy, business activity, and business confidence have had, and is likely to continue to have, a significant effect on the market price of securities generally, including our Class A common stock. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. For example, beginning on April 15, 2019, purported stockholders of our company filed putative securities class action against Eventbrite, certain of our executives and directors, and our underwriters for the IPO, on behalf of a putative class of persons who purchased or acquired Eventbrite securities traceable to our IPO and/or who purchased or acquired Eventbrite securities between September 20, 2018 and May 1, 2019, inclusive. During this period, the closing price of our Class A common stock ranged from a high of $37.97 to a low of $19.06. See the risk factor above titled \u201cUnfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may harm our business and results of operations.\u201d\nMoreover, because of these fluctuations, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our net revenue or results of operations fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated net revenue or earnings forecasts that we may provide.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our directors, executive officers and their affiliates and that may depress the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of December 31, 2021, our directors, executive officers and stockholders holding more than 5% of our outstanding shares, and their affiliates, beneficially owned in the aggregate a very large majority of the voting power of our capital stock. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval until September 20, 2028, the date that is the ten-year anniversary of the closing of our IPO. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction requiring stockholder approval. In addition, this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long-term.\nIn addition, certain index providers, such as S&P Dow Jones, have restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indices. Accordingly, the dual class structure of our common stock makes us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track those indices may not invest in our Class A common stock and may make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. It is possible that these policies may depress valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from such indices, as compared to similar companies that are included. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be harmed.\nCommencing December 31, 2019, we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies no longer apply to us.\nOn June 28, 2019, the market value of our common stock that was held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million, so we no longer qualified for emerging growth company status as of December 31, 2019. As a large-accelerated filer, we are now subject to certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that were not applicable to us as an emerging growth company. These requirements include:\n\u2022compliance with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022compliance with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u2022full disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u2022compliance with the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nCompliance with these additional requirements may increase our compliance and financial reporting expenses and may divert management\u2019s attention from other aspects of our business. Failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to enforcement actions by the SEC, which could divert management\u2019s attention, damage our reputation and harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, the price of our Class A common stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If industry analysts cease publishing research on our company, the trading price for our Class A common stock would be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our Class A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our Class A common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us on a regular basis, demand for our Class A common stock could decrease, which might cause our Class A common stock price and trading volume to decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public markets, or the perception that sales might occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock into the public market, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, and principal stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline. As of February 9, 2022, we had 86,743,897 shares of Class A common stock outstanding and 10,812,927 shares of Class B common stock outstanding.\nSales of our common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales also could cause our stock price to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our common stock.\nOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\nIf we issue additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, equity incentive plans or otherwise, our existing stockholders could experience significant dilution. For example, in connection with the execution of the credit agreement we entered into in May 2020, we issued and sold 2,599,174 shares of Class A common stock for a purchase price of $0.01 per share, resulting in dilution to our equity holders. We may also raise capital through additional equity or equity-linked financings. In addition, the conversion of some or all of our Convertible Notes may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes. Any sales in the public market of our Class A common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A common stock. The existence of the Convertible Notes also may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Convertible Notes could be used to satisfy short positions. The anticipated conversion of the Convertible Notes into shares of our Class A common stock could also depress the price of our Class A common stock. We also expect to grant equity awards to employees, directors and consultants under our stock incentive plans. As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies and issue equity securities to pay\nfor any such acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our Class A common stock to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our Class A common stock and, consequently, the ability of Class A common stockholders to achieve a return on investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our capital stock. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, Class A common stockholders may only receive a return on your investment in our Class A common stock if the market price of our Class A common stock increases.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current board of directors and limit the market price of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022provide that our board of directors be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly-created directorships;\n\u2022require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u2022provide that only the Chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer, or a majority of our board of directors is authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022provide for a dual class common stock structure in which holders of our Class B common stock have the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets;\n\u2022prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022provide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nMoreover, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations, and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for:\n\u2022any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; or\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. The exclusive forum provision does not apply to claims under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.", "PERMNO": 18063, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "EB"}
