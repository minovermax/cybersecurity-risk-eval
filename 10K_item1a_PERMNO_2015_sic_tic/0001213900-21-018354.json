You should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before investing in our common stock. Our business and results of operations could be seriously harmed by any of the following risks. The risks set out below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the value and trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary Risk Factors\nThe principal factors and uncertainties that make investing in our ordinary shares risky, include, among others:\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\n\u25cf We have historically incurred significant losses and there can be no assurance when, or if, we will achieve or maintain profitability.\n\u25cf Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.\n\u25cf We will need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future, which is likely to be challenging, could be highly dilutive and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\n\u25cf The report of our independent registered public accounting firm contains an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nRisks Related to Our Company and Our Business\n\u25cf We are substantially dependent on assets we purchased from a related party, and if we lose the rights to such assets or the assets are repurchased for any reason, our ability to develop existing and new applications based upon these assets would be harmed, and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\n\u25cf We may never successfully develop any products or generate revenues.\n\u25cf The market for our measurement technology is new and unproven, may experience limited growth and is highly dependent on U.S. retailers and online third party resellers adopting our flagship product, MySizeID.\n\u25cf Our business may be adversely affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u25cf Failure to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to grow our business and achieve broader market acceptance of our products.\n\u25cf We expect our sales cycle to be long and unpredictable and require considerable time and expense before executing a customer agreement, which may make it difficult to project when, if at all, we will obtain new customers and when we will generate revenue from those customers.\n\u25cf We may in the future engage in acquisitions, joint ventures or collaborations which may increase our capital requirements, dilute our shareholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities, and subject us to other risks. We may not realize the benefits of these acquisitions, joint ventures or collaborations.\n\u25cf If we are not able to enhance our brand and increase market awareness of our company and products, then our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\n\u25cf If we do not develop enhancements to our products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\u25cf The mobile technology industry is subject to rapid technological change and, to compete, we must continually enhance our mobile Apps and custom development services.\n\u25cf Our growth depends, in part, on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.\n\u25cf We rely upon third parties to provide distribution for our applications, and disruption in these services could harm our business.\n\u25cf We rely on third-party hosting and cloud computing providers to operate certain aspects of our business. Any failure, disruption or significant interruption in our network or hosting and cloud services could adversely impact our operations and harm our business.\n\u25cf Information technology system failures or breaches of our network security could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.\n\u25cf Real or perceived errors, failures, or bugs in our products could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.\n\u25cf We could be harmed by improper disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential company, employee, or customer data, including personal data.\n\u25cf A material breach in security relating to our information systems and regulation related to such breaches could adversely affect us.\n\u25cf Our products and our business are subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those regarding privacy, data protection and information security, and our customers may be subject to regulations related to the handling and transfer of certain types of sensitive and confidential information. Any failure of our products to comply with or enable our customers to comply with applicable laws and regulations would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u25cf We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which, in turn, could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.\n\u25cf We may face intense competition and expect competition to increase in the future, which could prohibit us from developing a customer base and generating revenue.\n\u25cf Our business operations and future development could be significantly disrupted if we lose key members of our management team.\n\u25cf If we are able to expand our operations, we may be unable to successfully manage our future growth.\nRisks Related To Our Operations In Israel\n\u25cf Our headquarters and most of our operations are located in Israel, and therefore, political conditions in Israel may affect our operations and results.\nRisks Related To Our Common Stock\n\u25cf A more active, liquid trading market for our common stock may not develop, and the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\n\u25cf Sales by our stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n\u25cf Our securities are traded on more than one market which may result in price variations.\n\u25cf We are a former \u201cshell company\u201d and as such are subject to certain limitations not applicable to other public companies generally.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have historically incurred significant losses and there can be no assurance when, or if, we will achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe realized a net loss of approximately $6.2 million and $5.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and had an accumulated deficit of $34.7 million as at December 31, 2020. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our products and business, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all. Expected future operating losses will have an adverse effect on our cash resources, shareholders\u2019 equity and working capital. Our failure to become and remain profitable could depress the value of our stock and impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our development efforts, or continue our operations. A decline in our value could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment in us.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.\nWe have only been developing our measurement technology since 2014. Since then, our operating history has been primarily limited to research and development, pilot studies, raising capital, and limited sales and marketing efforts. Therefore, it may be difficult to evaluate our business and prospects. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to commercialize our products. Consequently, any predictions about our future performance may not be accurate, and you may not be able to fully assess our ability to complete development and/or commercialize our products, and any future products.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to meet our business requirements in the future, which is likely to be challenging, could be highly dilutive and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nBased on our projected cash flows and the cash balances as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe we have sufficient cash to fund our obligations through January 2022. However, in order to meet our business objectives in the future, we will need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Additional capital would be used to accomplish the following:\n\u25cf finance our current operating expenses;\n\u25cf pursue growth opportunities;\n\u25cf hire and retain qualified management and key employees;\n\u25cf respond to competitive pressures;\n\u25cf comply with regulatory requirements; and\n\u25cf maintain compliance with applicable laws.\nCurrent conditions in the capital markets are such that traditional sources of capital may not be available to us when needed or may be available only on unfavorable terms. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions, the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully raise additional capital at all or on terms that are acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in substantial dilution for our current stockholders. The terms of any securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect on the holders of any of our securities then-outstanding. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock in connection with hiring or retaining personnel, option or warrant exercises, future acquisitions or future placements of our securities for capital-raising or other business purposes. The issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline and existing stockholders may not agree with our financing plans or the terms of such financings. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, securities law compliance fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we issue, such as convertible notes and warrants, which may adversely impact our financial condition. Furthermore, any additional debt or equity financing that we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we are unable to obtain such additional financing on a timely basis, we may have to curtail our development activities and growth plans and/or be forced to sell assets, perhaps on unfavorable terms, or we may have to cease our operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe report of our independent registered public accounting firm contains an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations and has an accumulated deficit that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020 were prepared under the assumption that we would continue our operations as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm has included a \u201cgoing concern\u201d explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. If we are unable to improve our liquidity position, by, among other things, raising capital through public or private offerings or reducing our expenses, we may exhaust our cash resources and will be unable to continue our operations. If we cannot continue as a viable entity, our shareholders would likely lose most or all of their investment in us.\nRisks Related to Our Company and Our Business\nWe are substantially dependent on assets we purchased from a former related party, and if we lose the rights to such assets or the assets are repurchased for any reason, our ability to develop existing and new applications based upon these assets would be significantly harmed, and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nIn February 2014, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with a former related party, Shoshana Zigdon, or the Seller, pursuant to which we acquired certain rights related to the collection of data for measurement purposes including rights in the venture, the method and a patent application that had been filed by the Seller (PCT/IL2013/050056), or the Assets. Our business is substantially dependent upon the Assets we acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. Therefore, our ability to develop and commercialize our applications depends upon the effectiveness and continuation of the Purchase Agreement. If we lose the rights, including the rights to the patent that comprise the Assets, our ability to develop existing and new applications would be harmed. In consideration for the sale of the Assets, we agreed to pay to Ms. Zigdon, 18% of our operating profit, directly or indirectly connected with the Assets together with value-added tax in accordance with the Israeli tax law for a period of seven years from the end of the development period of the aforementioned venture.\nThe Purchase Agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of an uncured material breach. The Purchase Agreement further provides that the Seller is entitled to repurchase the Assets from us upon the occurrence of one or more of the following events: (a) in the case of liquidation or bankruptcy of the Company; or (b) if on the seventh anniversary of the execution of the Purchase Agreement, the amount of our income, directly and/or indirectly derived from the Assets is less than NIS 3.6 million (approximately $1 million). As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have only generated limited revenue and as a consequence of the passage of seven years since execution of the Purchase Agreement, Ms. Zigdon, has a right to repurchase the Assets for 90 days from February 16, 2021 at the market price of the Assets as determined by a third party independent valuation. In accordance with the Purchase Agreement, on March 7, 2021, we notified Ms. Zigdon that the amount of our income, directly and/or indirectly derived from the Assets is less than NIS 3.6 million. We intend to negotiate the waiver of Ms. Zigdon\u2019s right to repurchase of the Assets and in consideration of such waiver expect to pay cash or issue shares of common stock and/or common stock equivalents, or a combination of both. At this stage, we are unable to estimate the amount or form of consideration that we will expect to pay in consideration of the waiver. To the extent that we pay cash, this could materially reduce the amount of cash available for working capital and other purposes and to the extent we issue any equity this could result in substantial dilution to you and our then current stockholders. If Ms. Zigdon exercises her right to repurchase the Assets, our ability to develop and commercialize our products would be significantly harmed and we may cease operations.\nWe may never successfully develop any products or generate significant revenues.\nWe only recently transitioned into the commercialization phase of our products and have only generated minimal revenues to date. We may be unable to successfully develop or market any of our current or proposed products or technologies, those products or technologies may not generate any revenues, and any revenues generated may not be sufficient for us to become profitable or thereafter maintain profitability.\nThe market for our measurement technology is new and unproven, may experience limited growth and is highly dependent on U.S. retailers and online third party resellers adopting our flagship product, MySizeID.\nThe market for our measurement technology is relatively new and unproven and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. We believe that our future success will depend in large part on market adoption of our flagship product, MySizeID, by U.S. retailers and online third party resellers. In order to grow our business, we intend to focus on educating retailers and resellers and other potential customers about the benefits of our measurement technology, expanding the functionality of our products and bringing new products to market to increase market acceptance and use of our technology. Our ability to develop and expand the market that our products address depends upon a number of factors, including the cost savings, performance and perceived value associated with such products. The market for our products could fail to develop or there could be a reduction in interest or demand for our products as a result of a lack of consumer acceptance, technological challenges, competing products and services, weakening economic conditions and other causes. We may never successfully commercialize our products and if our products fail to achieve market acceptance, this would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.\nPublic health epidemics or outbreaks could adversely impact our business. In late 2019, a novel strain of COVID-19, also known as coronavirus, was reported in Wuhan, China. While initially the outbreak was largely concentrated in China, it has now spread to Israel and the United States, and infections have been reported globally. Many countries around the world, including in Israel, have implemented significant governmental measures to control the spread of the virus, including temporary closure of businesses, severe restrictions on travel and the movement of people, and other material limitations on the conduct of business. These measures have resulted in work stoppages and other disruptions. We implemented remote working and work place protocols for our employees in accordance with Israeli government requirements. In addition, while we have seen an increased demand for MySizeID, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a particularly adverse impact on the retail industry and this has resulted in an adverse impact on our marketing and sales activities. For example, we have three ongoing pilots with international retailers that have been halted, we are unable to participate physically in industry conferences, our ability to meet with potential customers is limited, and in certain instances sales processes have been delayed or cancelled. The extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration and severity of the outbreak, and the actions that may be required to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact.\nIn particular, the continued spread of COVID-19 in Israel and globally could adversely impact our operations, including among others, our sales and marketing efforts and our ability to raise additional funds, and accordingly, the impact of coronavirus could have an adverse impact on our business and our financial results.\nFailure to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to grow our business and achieve broader market acceptance of our products.\nOur ability to achieve customer adoption, especially among U.S. retailers will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively organize, focus and train our sales and marketing personnel. We have limited experience selling to U.S. retailers and only recently established a U.S. sales force. We believe that there is significant competition for experienced sales professionals with the skills and industry knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend, in part, on our ability to recruit, train and retain a sufficient number of experienced sales professionals, particularly those with experience selling to U.S. retailers. In addition, even if we are successful in hiring qualified sales personnel, new hires require significant training and experience before they achieve full productivity, particularly for sales efforts targeted at U.S. retailers and new markets. Because we only recently started sales efforts, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, our sales efforts will be successful.\nWe expect our sales cycle to be long and unpredictable and require considerable time and expense before executing a customer agreement, which may make it difficult to project when, if at all, we will obtain new customers and when we will generate revenue from those customers.\nAs we seek adoption of our products by U.S. retailers, we expect to incur higher costs and long sales cycles, especially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this market segment, the decision to adopt our products may require the approval of multiple technical and business decision makers, including security, compliance, procurement, operations and IT. In addition, while U.S. retailers may be willing to deploy our products on a limited basis, before they will commit to deploying our products at scale, they often require extensive education about our products and significant customer support time, engage in protracted pricing negotiations and seek to secure readily available development resources. As a result, it is difficult to predict when we will obtain new customers and begin generating revenue from these customers. As part of our sales cycle, we may incur significant expenses before executing a definitive agreement with a prospective customer and before we are able to generate any revenue from such agreement. We have no assurance that the substantial time and money spent on our sales efforts will generate significant revenue. If conditions in the marketplace generally or with a specific prospective customer change negatively, it is possible that no definitive agreement will be executed, and we will be unable to recover any of these expenses. If we are not successful in targeting, supporting and streamlining our sales processes and if revenue expected to be generated from a prospective customer is not realized in the time period expected or not realized at all, our ability to grow our business, and our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected. If our sales cycles lengthen, our future revenue could be lower than expected, which would have an adverse impact on our operating results and could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may in the future engage in acquisitions, joint ventures or collaborations which may increase our capital requirements, dilute our shareholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities, and subject us to other risks. We may not realize the benefits of these acquisitions, joint ventures or collaborations.\nIn order to reduce time to market and obtain complementary technologies, we are seeking to acquire technologies and businesses that are synergistic to our product offering. We may evaluate various acquisitions and collaborations, including licensing or acquiring complementary technologies, intellectual property rights, or businesses. The process for acquiring a company may take from several months up to a year and costs can vary greatly. We may also compete with others to acquire companies, and such competition may result in decreased availability of, or an increase in price for, suitable acquisition candidates. In addition, we may not be able to consummate acquisitions or investments that we have identified as crucial to the implementation of our strategy for other commercial or economic reasons. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to identify suitable acquisition or investment targets or to consummate acquisitions or investments on acceptable terms or at all. If we are not able to execute on any acquisition, we may not be able to achieve a future growth strategy and may lose market share.\nIn addition, any potential acquisition, joint venture or collaboration will entail numerous potential risks, including:\n\u25cf increased operating expenses and cash requirements;\n\u25cf the assumption of additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities;\n\u25cf assimilation of operations, intellectual property and products of an acquired company, including difficulties associated with integrating new personnel;\n\u25cf the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our existing programs and initiatives in pursuing such a strategic merger or acquisition;\n\u25cf retention of key employees, the loss of key personnel, and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships;\n\u25cf risks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction, including the prospects of that party and their existing technologies; and\n\u25cf our inability to generate revenue from acquired technologies or products sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition or even to offset the associated acquisition and maintenance costs.\nAll of the foregoing risks may be magnified as the cost, size or complexity of an acquisition or acquired company increases, or where the acquired company\u2019s products, market or business are materially different from ours, or where more than one integration is occurring simultaneously or within a concentrated period of time. We may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, including those of antitrust authorities and foreign investment authorities, in countries where we seek to consummate acquisitions or make investments. For those and other reasons, we may ultimately fail to consummate an acquisition, even if we announce the intended acquisition.\nIn addition, we may require significant financing to complete an acquisition or investment, whether through bank loans, raising of equity or debt or otherwise. We cannot assure you that such financing options will be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all. If we are not able to obtain such necessary financing, it could have an impact on our ability to consummate a substantial acquisition or investment and execute a future growth strategy. Alternatively, we may issue a significant number of shares as consideration for an acquisition, which would have a dilutive effect on our existing shareholders. Furthermore, if we undertake acquisitions, we may incur large one-time expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense.\nIf we are not able to enhance our brand and increase market awareness of our company and products, then our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that enhancing the \u201cMySize\u201d brand identity and increasing market awareness of our company and products, particularly among U.S. retailers, is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products. Our ability to successfully develop new retailers may be adversely affected by a lack of awareness or acceptance of our brand. To the extent that we are unable to foster name recognition and affinity for our brand, our growth may be significantly delayed or impaired. The successful promotion of our brand will depend largely on our continued marketing efforts, market adoption of our products, and our ability to successfully differentiate our products from competing products and services. Our brand promotion may not be successful or result in revenue generation. Any incident that erodes consumer affinity for our brand could significantly reduce our brand value and damage our business. If consumers perceive or experience a reduction in quality, or in any way believe we fail to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer and our business may be adversely affected.\nIn particular, adverse weather conditions can impact guest traffic at our retailers, and, in more severe cases, cause temporary retail closures, sometimes for prolonged periods. Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, with retail sales typically higher during certain months, such as December. Adverse weather conditions during our most favorable months or periods may exacerbate the effect of adverse weather on consumer traffic and may cause fluctuations in our operating results from quarter-to-quarter within a fiscal year.\nIf we do not develop enhancements to our products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to attract new customers depends in part on our ability to enhance and improve our existing products, increase adoption and usage of our products and introduce new products. The success of any enhancements or new products depends on several factors, including timely completion, adequate quality testing, actual performance quality, and overall market acceptance. Enhancements and new products that we develop may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner, may contain errors or defects, may have interoperability difficulties with our platform or other products or may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. Furthermore, our ability to increase the usage of our products depends, in part, on the development of new use cases for our products and may be outside of our control. If we are unable to successfully enhance our existing products to meet evolving customer requirements, increase adoption and usage of our products, develop new products, then our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nThe mobile technology industry is subject to rapid technological change and, to compete, we must continually enhance our mobile Apps and custom development services.\nWe must continue to enhance and improve the performance, functionality and reliability of our products. The mobile technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change, changes in user requirements and preferences, frequent new product and services introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our products obsolete. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to both internally develop and enhance our existing products, develop new products that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our customers, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis. The development of our technology involves significant technical and business risks. We may fail to use new technologies effectively or to adapt our proprietary technology and systems to customer requirements or emerging industry standards. If we are unable to adapt to changing market conditions, customer requirements or emerging industry standards, we may not be able to increase our revenue and expand our business.\nChanges in economic conditions could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our primary target customers include U.S. retailers, we, together with the rest of the fashion/apparel industry, will depend upon consumer discretionary spending. Increases in unemployment rates, reductions in home values, increases in home foreclosures, investment losses, personal bankruptcies and reductions in access to credit and reduced consumer confidence, may impact consumers\u2019 ability and willingness to spend discretionary dollars. In addition, volatile economic conditions may repress consumer confidence and discretionary spending. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur growth depends, in part, on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.\nTo grow our business, we anticipate that we will continue to depend on relationships with third parties, such as our customers and third party platforms. Identifying partners, and negotiating and documenting relationships with them, requires significant time and resources. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired, and our results of operations may suffer. Even if we are successful, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in increased customer usage of our products or increased revenue.\nWe rely upon third parties to provide distribution for our applications, and disruption in these services could harm our business.\nWe currently utilize, and plan on continuing to utilize over the current fiscal year, third-party networking providers and distribution through companies including, but not limited to, Apple and Google as well as Shopify, WooCommerce and, Datalogic, Honeywell and Zebra to distribute our technologies. If disruptions or capacity constraints occur, we may have no means of replacing these services, on a timely basis or at all. This could cause a material adverse condition for our operations and financial earnings.\nWe rely on third-party hosting and cloud computing providers to operate certain aspects of our business. Any failure, disruption or significant interruption in our network or hosting and cloud services could adversely impact our operations and harm our business.\nOur technology infrastructure is critical to the performance of our products and customer satisfaction. Our products run on a complex distributed system, or what is commonly known as cloud computing. We own, operate and maintain elements of this system, but significant elements of this system are operated by third-parties that we do not control and which would require significant time to replace. We expect this dependence on third-parties to continue. In particular, a significant portion, if not almost all data storage, data processing and other computing services and systems is hosted by cloud computing providers. Any disruptions, outages and other performance problems relating to such services, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors and capacity constraints, could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nInformation technology system failures or breaches of our network security could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.\nOur operations depend upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and systems against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems. Any damage or failure of our computer systems or network infrastructure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and subject us to litigation or actions by regulatory authorities. Although we employ both internal resources and external consultants to conduct auditing and testing for weaknesses in our systems, controls, firewalls and encryption and intend to maintain and upgrade our security technology and operational procedures to prevent such damage, breaches or other disruptive problems, there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful.\nReal or perceived errors, failures, or bugs in our products could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.\nWe update our products on a frequent basis. Despite efforts to test our updates, errors, failures or bugs may not be found in our products until after they are deployed to a customer. We have discovered and expect we will continue to discover errors, failures and bugs in our products and anticipate that certain of these errors, failures and bugs will only be discovered and remediated after deployment. Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our platform could result in negative publicity, government inquiries, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, loss of competitive position, or claims by customers for losses sustained by them. In such an event, we may be required, or may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources in order to help correct the problem.\nWe could be harmed by improper disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential company, employee, or customer data, including personal data.\nIn connection with the operation of our business, we store, process and transmit data, including personal and payment information, about our employees and customers, a portion of which is confidential and/or personally sensitive. Unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential data may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyberattack by computer programmers, hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who may develop and deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs. Such disclosure, loss or breach could harm our reputation and subject us to government sanctions and liability under our contracts and laws that protect sensitive or personal data and confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. It is possible that security controls over sensitive or confidential data and other practices we and our third-party vendors follow may not prevent the improper access to, disclosure of, or loss of such information. The potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks may increase as we introduce new products and offerings. Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions in which we provide services. Any failure or perceived failure to successfully manage the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, or any failure to comply with changing regulatory requirements in this area, could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace.\nA material breach in security relating to our information systems and regulation related to such breaches could adversely affect us.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years, in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the Internet, and the increased sophistication and activity of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, cybercriminals and other external parties, some of which may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. For example, a cybercriminal could use cybersecurity threats to gain access to sensitive information about another company or to alter or disrupt news or information to be distributed by PR Newswire. Cybersecurity attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include malicious software, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data, substantially damaging our reputation. Any person who circumvents our security measures could steal proprietary or confidential customer information or cause interruptions in our operations. We incur significant costs to protect against security breaches, and may incur significant additional costs to alleviate problems caused by any breaches. Our failure to prevent security breaches, or well-publicized security breaches affecting the Internet in general, could significantly harm our reputation and business and financial results.\nOur products and our business are subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those regarding privacy, data protection and information security, and our customers may be subject to regulations related to the handling and transfer of certain types of sensitive and confidential information. Any failure of our products to comply with or enable our customers to comply with applicable laws and regulations would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe and our customers that use our products may be subject to privacy- and data protection-related laws and regulations that impose obligations in connection with the collection, processing and use of personal data, financial data, health or other similar data. The U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on, or requirements regarding, the collection, distribution, use, security and storage of personally identifiable information of individuals. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and numerous state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards on the online collection, use and dissemination of data, and to the security measures applied to such data.\nSimilarly, many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the EU member states, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personally identifiable information obtained from individuals located in the EU or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction, which are often more restrictive than those in the United States. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of personally identifiable information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, telephone numbers, email addresses and, in some jurisdictions, IP addresses and other online identifiers.\nFor example, the GDPR, which took full effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for businesses and requires service providers (data processors) processing personal data on behalf of customers to cooperate with European data protection authorities, implement security measures and keep records of personal data processing activities. Noncompliance with the GDPR can trigger fines equal to or greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of global annual revenues. In addition, the CCPA, effective as of January 1, 2020, gives California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches, that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Further, failure to comply with the Israeli Privacy Protection Law of 1981, and its regulations, as well as the guidelines of the Israeli Privacy Protection Authority, may expose us to administrative fines, civil claims (including class actions) and in certain cases criminal liability. Current pending legislation may result in a change of the current enforcement measures and sanctions. There are also additional laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions around the world which govern the protection of consumers and of electronic communications. If our efforts to comply with GDPR, CCPA or other applicable laws and regulations are not successful, we may be subject to penalties and fines that would adversely impact our business and results of operations, and our ability to conduct business could be significantly impaired.\nAdditionally, although we endeavor to have our products comply with applicable laws and regulations, these and other obligations may be modified, they may be interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and they may conflict with one another, other regulatory requirements, contractual commitments or our internal practices. We also may be bound by contractual obligations relating to our collection, use and disclosure of personal, financial and other data or may find it necessary or desirable to join industry or other self-regulatory bodies or other privacy- or data protection-related organizations that require compliance with their rules pertaining to privacy and data protection.\nWe expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, rules of self-regulatory bodies, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, rules, regulations and standards may have on our business. Moreover, existing U.S. federal and various state and foreign privacy- and data protection-related laws and regulations are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations, and various legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws and regulations regarding privacy- and data protection-related matters. Because global laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy and data security have continued to develop and evolve rapidly, it is possible that we or our products or platform may not be, or may not have been, compliant with each such applicable law, regulation and industry standard and compliance with such new laws or to changes to existing laws may impact our business and practices, require us to expend significant resources to adapt to these changes, or to stop offering our products in certain countries. These developments could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which, in turn, could harm the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to build brand recognition using our trademarks, service marks and other proprietary intellectual property, including our names and logos. We currently have no registered trademarks. While we plan to register a number of our trademarks; however, no assurance can be given that our trademark applications will be approved. We have been issued ten patents, three of each in of Russia and the US and one each in Canada, Japan and Israel., and have several patent applications in process. No assurance can be given that our patent applications which are in process will be approved. If our patent applications are not approved, our ability to expand or develop our business may be negatively affected.\nThird parties may also oppose our trademark or patent applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks or patents. In the event that our trademarks or patents are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our goods and services or redesign our technology, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands and products.\nIf our efforts to register, maintain and protect our intellectual property are inadequate, or if any third party misappropriates, dilutes or infringes on our intellectual property, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance. We may also face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. If third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights, our operating profits could be adversely affected. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, require us to rebrand our services, if feasible, divert management\u2019s attention and resources or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nAny royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in our being required to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements, or stop the sale of certain products or services, any of which could have a negative impact on our operating profits and harm our future prospects.\nWe may face intense competition and expect competition to increase in the future, which could prohibit us from developing a customer base and generating revenue.\nWe face significant competition in every aspect of our business. Our competitors include True Fit, Virtusize, EasyMeasure, AR MeasureKit, Smart Measure and 3DLook. These companies may already have an established market in our industry. Most of these companies have significantly greater financial and other resources than us and have been developing their products and services longer than we have been developing ours.\nIn addition, some of our larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products to gain business in a manner that discourages potential customers from purchasing our products. Potential customers may also prefer to purchase from their existing solution providers rather than a new solution provider regardless of product performance or features. These larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market. Conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, partnering by our competitors or continuing market consolidation. New start-up companies that innovate and large competitors that are making significant investments in research and development may invent similar or superior products and technologies that compete with our products. In addition, some of our competitors may enter into new alliances with each other or may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships. Any such consolidation, acquisition, alliance or cooperative relationship could lead to pricing pressure and our loss of any future market share and could result in a competitor with greater financial, technical, marketing, service and other resources, all of which could harm our ability to compete. Furthermore, organizations may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing infrastructure from competitors than to replace their existing infrastructure with our products. Any failure to meet and address these factors could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business operations and future development could be significantly disrupted if we lose key members of our management team.\nThe success of our business continues to depend to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior officers and key employees, both individually and as a group. Our future performance will be substantially dependent in particular on our ability to retain and motivate Ronen Luzon, our Chief Executive Officer, and certain of our other senior executive officers. The loss of the services of our Chief Executive Officer, senior officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and plans for future development. We have no reason to believe that we will lose the services of any of these individuals in the foreseeable future; however, we currently have no effective replacement for any of these individuals due to their experience, reputation in the industry and special role in our operations. We also do not maintain any key man life insurance policies for any of our employees.\nIf we are able to expand our operations, we may be unable to successfully manage our future growth.\nOur growth may strain our infrastructure and resources. Any such growth could place increased strain on our management, operational, financial and other resources, and we will need to train, motivate, and manage employees, as well as attract management, sales, finance and accounting, international, technical, and other professionals. Any failure to expand these areas and implement appropriate procedures and controls in an efficient manner and at a pace consistent with our business objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business operations are conducted in multiple languages and could be disrupted due to miscommunications or translation errors.\nThe success of our business continues to depend on our marketing efforts in the United States, Europe and Israel, each of which is conducted in the local language. Miscommunications or inaccurate foreign language translations could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial conditions. Additionally, contracts, communications and complex technical information must be accurately translated into foreign languages.\nWe will continue to incur costs and be subject to various obligations as a result of being a public company, listed in the United States and in Israel.\nWe will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses as a result of being a public company, listed in the United States and in Israel. Although we will incur costs each year associated with being a publicly-traded company, it is possible that our actual costs of being a publicly-traded company will vary from year to year and may be different than our estimates. In estimating these costs, we take into account expenses related to insurance, legal, accounting and compliance activities.\nFurthermore, the need to maintain the corporate infrastructure demanded of a public company may divert management\u2019s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a U.S. publicly traded company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a publicly traded company.\nAny future or current litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nFrom time to time we may be subject to litigation, including, among others, potential stockholder derivative actions and class actions. Risks associated with legal liability are difficult to assess and quantify, and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time. Subject to certain exceptions, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or Certificate of Incorporation, and Amended and Restated Bylaws, or Bylaws, require us to indemnify and advance expenses to our officers and directors involved in legal proceedings. To date we have obtained directors and officers\u2019 liability, or D&O, insurance to cover some of the risk exposure for our directors and officers. Such insurance generally pays the expenses (including amounts paid to plaintiffs, fines, and expenses including attorneys\u2019 fees) of officers and directors who are the subject of a lawsuit as a result of their service to us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to maintain this insurance at reasonable rates or at all, or in amounts adequate to cover such expenses should such a lawsuit occur. Without D&O insurance, the amounts we would pay to indemnify our officers and directors should they be subject to legal action based on their service to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Such lawsuits, and any related publicity, may result in substantial costs and, among other things, divert the attention of management and our employees. An unfavorable outcome in any claim or proceeding against us could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations for the period in which the unfavorable outcome occurs, and potentially in future periods. Further, any settlement announced by us may expose us to further claims against us by third parties seeking monetary or other damages which, even if unsuccessful, would divert management attention from the business and cause us to incur costs, possibly material, to defend such matters, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d on page 34 for more information regarding our involvement in ongoing litigation matters.\nFederal, state and local or Israeli tax rules may adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local taxes in the U.S., as well as local taxes in Israel in respect to our operations in Israel. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if the Internal Revenue Service or other taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken on our tax returns, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. If material, payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, complying with new tax rules, laws or regulations could impact our financial condition, and increases to federal or state statutory tax rates and other changes in tax laws, rules or regulations may increase our effective tax rate. Any increase in our effective tax rate could have a material impact on our financial results.\nRisks Related To Our Operations In Israel\nOur headquarters and most of our operations are located in Israel, and therefore, political conditions in Israel may affect our operations and results.\nOur headquarters and most of our operations are located in central Israel and our key employees, officers and directors are residents of Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel and the surrounding region may directly affect our business. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors. Any hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade within Israel or between Israel and its trading partners could adversely affect our operations and results of operations and could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. During the winter of 2008, winter of 2012 and the summer of 2014, Israel was engaged in an armed conflict with Hamas, a militia group and political party operating in the Gaza Strip, and during the summer of 2006, Israel was engaged in an armed conflict with Hezbollah, a Lebanese Islamist Shiite militia group and political party. Israel faces political tension with respect to its relationships with Turkey, Iran and certain Arab neighbor countries. In addition, recent conflicts involved missile strikes against civilian targets in various parts of Israel, and negatively affected business conditions in Israel. Recent political uprisings and social unrest in various countries in the Middle East and North Africa are affecting the political stability of those countries. This instability may lead to deterioration of the political relationships that exist between Israel and these countries, and have raised concerns regarding security in the region and the potential for armed conflict. Any armed conflicts, terrorist activities or political instability in the region could adversely affect business conditions and could harm our results of operations. For example, any major escalation in hostilities in the region could result in a portion of our employees and service providers being called up to perform military duty for an extended period of time. Parties with whom we do business have sometimes declined to travel to Israel during periods of heightened unrest or tension, forcing us to make alternative arrangements when necessary. In addition, the political and security situation in Israel may result in parties with whom we have agreements involving performance in Israel claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments under those agreements pursuant to force majeure provisions in such agreements. Any future deterioration in the political and security situation in Israel will negatively impact our business.\nOur commercial insurance does not cover losses that may occur as a result of events associated with the security situation in the Middle East. Although the Israeli government currently covers the reinstatement value of direct damages that are caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we cannot assure you that this government coverage will be maintained. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any armed conflicts or political instability in the region would likely negatively affect business conditions and could harm our results of operations.\nFurther, in the past, the State of Israel and Israeli companies have been subjected to an economic boycott. Several countries still restrict business with the State of Israel and with Israeli companies. These restrictive laws and policies may have an adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition or the expansion of our business.\nThe legislative power of the State resides in the Knesset, a unicameral parliament that consists of 120 members elected by nationwide voting under a system of proportional representation. Israel\u2019s most recent general elections were held on April 9, 2019, September 17, 2019 and March 2, 2020. The uncertainty surrounding the results of the recent elections may continue. Actual or perceived political instability in Israel or any negative changes in the political environment, may individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Israeli economy and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIsrael\u2019s economy may become unstable.\nFrom time to time, Israel\u2019s economy may experience inflation or deflation, low foreign exchange reserves, fluctuations in world commodity prices, military conflicts and civil unrest. For these and other reasons, the government of Israel has intervened in the economy employing fiscal and monetary policies, import duties, foreign currency restrictions, controls of wages, prices and foreign currency exchange rates and regulations regarding the lending limits of Israeli banks to companies considered to be in an affiliated group. The Israeli government has periodically changed its policies in these areas. Reoccurrence of previous destabilizing factors could make it more difficult for us to operate its business and could adversely affect its business.\nSome of our employees are obligated to perform military reserve duty in Israel.\nMany Israeli citizens, including our employees are obligated to perform one month, and in some cases more, of annual military reserve duty until they reach the age of 40 (or older, for reservists with certain occupations) and, in the event of a military conflict, may be called to active duty. In response to increases in terrorist activity, there have been periods of significant call-ups of military reservists. It is possible that there will be military reserve duty call-ups in the future. Our operations could be disrupted by such call-ups. Such disruption could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIt may be difficult to enforce a non-Israeli judgment against the Company or its officers and directors.\nThe operating subsidiary of ours is incorporated in Israel. All of our executive officers and directors are not residents of the United States, and a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of our executive officers and directors are located outside the United States. Therefore, a judgment obtained against us, or any of these persons, including a judgment based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, may not be collectible in the United States and may not necessarily be enforced by an Israeli court. It also may be difficult to affect service of process on these persons in the United States or to assert U.S. securities law claims in original actions instituted in Israel. Additionally, it may be difficult for an investor, or any other person or entity, to initiate an action with respect to U.S. securities laws in Israel. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on an alleged violation of U.S. securities laws reasoning that Israel is not the most appropriate forum in which to bring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law and not U.S. law is applicable to the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law often involves the testimony of expert witnesses, which can be a time consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law. There is little binding case law in Israel that addresses the matters described above. As a result of the difficulty associated with enforcing a judgment against us in Israel, it may be impossible to collect any damages awarded by either a U.S. or foreign court.\nOur international operations could expose us to additional risks, including exchange rate fluctuations, legal regulations and political or economic instability that could harm our business and operating results.\nOur international operations expose us to the following risks which may have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results:\n\u25cf devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates including fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the NIS;\n\u25cf costs of compliance with local laws, including labor laws and intellectual property laws;\n\u25cf compliance with domestic and foreign government policies, including compliance with Israeli securities laws and TASE;\n\u25cf changes in trade regulations and procedures affecting approval, production, pricing, marketing, reimbursement for and access to, our products;\n\u25cf compliance with applicable foreign anti-corruption laws, anti-trust/competition laws, anti-Boycott Israel law and anti-money laundering laws; and\n\u25cf economic and geopolitical developments and conditions, including ongoing instability in global economies and financial markets, international hostilities, acts of terrorism and governmental reactions, inflation, outbreaks of contagious disease (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) and military and political alliances.\nRisks Related To Our Common Stock\nA more active, liquid trading market for our common stock may not develop, and the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market, it has only been traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market since July 25, 2016. There has been relatively limited trading volume in the market for our common stock, and a more active, liquid public trading market may not develop or may not be sustained. Limited liquidity in the trading market for our common stock may adversely affect a stockholder\u2019s ability to sell its shares of common stock at the time it wishes to sell them or at a price that it considers acceptable. If a more active, liquid public trading market does not develop, we may be limited in our ability to raise capital by selling shares of common stock and our ability to acquire other companies or assets by using shares of our common stock as consideration. In addition, if there is a thin trading market or \u201cfloat\u201d for our stock, the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a large float, our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile and it would be harder for you to liquidate any investment in our common stock. Furthermore, the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors, including:\n\u25cf our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u25cf changes in our earnings estimates;\n\u25cf investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf changes in the business, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors;\n\u25cf our failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts\u2019 projections;\n\u25cf changes in industry, general market or economic conditions;\n\u25cf announcements of legislative or regulatory changes; and\n\u25cf natural disasters and political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, political unrest, results of certain elections and votes, emergence of a pandemic, or other widespread health emergencies (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency, including for example, the recent the COVID-19 pandemic), boycotts, adoption or expansion of government trade restrictions, and other business restrictions.\nThe stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected the quoted prices of the securities of many companies. The changes often appear to occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price.\nSales by our stockholders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf any of our shareholders were to decide to sell large amounts of stock over a short period of time (presuming such sales were permitted) such sales could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well. Further, the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nOur securities are traded on more than one market which may result in price variations.\nOur securities have been trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market since July 2016 and on TASE since September 2005. Trading in our securities on such exchanges occurs in different currencies (U.S. dollars on the Nasdaq Capital Market and NIS on the TASE), and at different times (due to different time zones, trading days and public holidays in the United States and Israel). The trading prices of our securities on the two exchanges may differ due to the foregoing and other factors. Any decrease in the price of our shares on the TASE could cause a decrease in the trading price of our shares on the Nasdaq Capital Market and vice versa.\nWe are a smaller reporting company and, as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to such companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are a smaller reporting company, (i.e. a company with \u201cpublic float\u201d held by non-affiliates with a market value of less than $250 million) and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies. We have elected to adopt these reduced disclosure requirements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our taking advantage of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of our choices, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain our future earnings, if any, in order to reinvest in the development and growth of our business and, therefore, do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. Investors should not purchase our common stock expecting to receive cash dividends. Because we do not pay dividends, and there may be limited trading, investors may not have any manner to liquidate or receive any payment on their investment. Therefore, our failure to pay dividends may cause investors to not see any return on investment even if we are successful in our business operations. In addition, because we do not pay dividends we may have trouble raising additional funds, which could affect our ability to expand our business operations.\nWe can sell additional shares of common stock without consulting stockholders and without offering shares to existing stockholders, which would result in dilution of shareholders\u2019 interests in the company and could depress our stock price.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation currently authorizes 100,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 12,145,547 are currently outstanding as of March 26, 2021, and our board of directors is authorized to issue additional shares of our common stock. Although our board of directors intends to utilize its reasonable business judgment to fulfill its fiduciary obligations to our then existing stockholders in connection with any future issuance of our capital stock, the future issuance of additional shares of our capital stock could cause immediate, and potentially substantial, dilution to our existing stockholders, which could also have a material effect on the market value of the shares. Further, other than certain participation rights that we have granted in a past offering, our shares do not have preemptive rights, which means we can sell shares of our capital stock to other persons without offering purchasers in this offering the right to purchase their proportionate share of such offered shares. Therefore, any additional sales of stock by us could dilute your ownership interest in our Company.\nA number of our outstanding warrants contain anti-dilution provisions that, if triggered, could cause substantial dilution to our then-existing stockholders and adversely affect our stock price.\nA number of our outstanding warrants contain anti-dilution provisions. As a result, if we, in the future, issue or grant any rights to purchase any of our common stock or other securities convertible into our common stock, for a per share price less than the exercise price of certain of our warrants, the exercise price will be reduced, subject to certain exceptions. To the extent that we issue or are or deemed to have issued securities for consideration that is less than the exercise price of those warrants, holders of our common stock may experience dilution, which may be substantial and which could lower the market price of our securities. Further, the potential application of such anti-dilution rights may prevent us from seeking additional financing, which would adversely affect our ability to finance our operations and continue to support our growth initiatives.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. Our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf variations in the level of expenses related to our research and development;\n\u25cf any lawsuits in which we may become involved;\n\u25cf regulatory developments affecting our products; and\n\u25cf our execution of any collaborative, licensing or sales agreements, and the timing of payments under these arrangements.\nIf our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nIf we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 related to accounting controls and procedures or if we discover material weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult.\nIf we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to disclosure controls and procedures, or, if we discover material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors addressing these assessments. If material weaknesses or significant deficiencies are discovered or if we otherwise fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if closing such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Delaware law also could have the effect of discouraging potential acquisition proposals or making a tender offer or delaying or preventing a change in control, including changes a stockholder might consider favorable. Such provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. In particular, the Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws and Delaware law, as applicable, among other things:\n\u25cf provide the board of directors with the ability to alter the Bylaws without stockholder approval;\n\u25cf place limitations on the removal of directors;\n\u25cf provide that vacancies on the board of directors may be filled by a majority of directors in office, although less than a quorum;\n\u25cf require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and generally prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent;\n\u25cf eliminate the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u25cf establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at duly called stockholder meetings.\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d between a publicly-held Delaware corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation\u2019s voting stock for a three-year period following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder. These provisions are expected to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our Board. These provisions may delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us, which may cause the market price of our common stock and the value of our securities to decline. In addition, rules applicable to TASE listed companies also limit the terms permitted with respect to a new class of shares and prohibit any such new class of shares from having superior voting rights to the rights of the class of shares listed on TASE.\nIf we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted.\nNasdaq has established certain standards for the continued listing of a security on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The standards for continued listing include, among other things, that the minimum bid price for the listed securities not fall below $1.00 per share for a period of 30 consecutive trading days and that we maintain a minimum of $2,500,000 in shareholders\u2019 equity.\nOn January 22, 2019, we were notified by the Nasdaq Stock Market that we were not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirements set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), or the Rule, for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We regained compliance with the Rule on May 12, 2020, and this matter is now closed.\nNo assurance can be given that we will continue to meet applicable Nasdaq continued listing standards. Failure to meet applicable Nasdaq continued listing standards could result in a delisting of our common stock. A delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq could materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock and result in a corresponding material reduction in the price of our common stock. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, employees and fewer business development opportunities.\nThe exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options will have a dilutive effect on the percentage ownership of our capital stock by existing stockholders.\nAs of March 26, 2021, we had outstanding warrants to acquire 4,696,466 shares of our common stock and stock options to purchase 1,036,517 shares of our common stock, which warrants and options are exercisable for prices ranging between $0.04 and $15. The expiration of the term of such options and warrants range from April 2021 to August 2025. If a significant number of such warrants and stock options are exercised by the holders, the percentage of our common stock owned by our existing stockholders will be diluted.\nWere our common stock to become subject to the penny stock rules then this could result in U.S. broker-dealers becoming discouraged from effecting transactions in shares of our common stock.\nRule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. If we do not retain a listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market or do not meet certain net tangible asset or average revenue requirements and if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock will be deemed a penny stock. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (a) that a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks; and (b) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: (a) obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and (b) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks. The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which: (a) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and (b) confirms that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our common stock.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker or dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nSales of our currently issued and outstanding stock may become freely tradable pursuant to Rule 144 and may dilute the market for your shares and have a depressive effect on the price of the shares of our common stock.\nA portion of our outstanding shares of common stock are \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. As restricted shares, these shares may be resold only pursuant to an effective registration statement or under the requirements of Rule 144 or other applicable exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and as required under applicable state securities laws. Rule 144 provides in essence that an affiliate (as such term is defined in Rule 144(a)(1)) of an issuer who has held restricted securities for a period of at least six months (one year after filing Form 10 information with the SEC for shell companies and former shell companies) may, under certain conditions, sell every three months, in brokerage transactions, a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of 1% of a company\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock or the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks prior to the sale (the four calendar week rule does not apply to companies quoted on the OTC Markets). Rule 144 also permits, under certain circumstances, the sale of securities, without any limitation, by a person who is not an Affiliate of the Company and who has satisfied a one-year holding period. A sale under Rule 144 or under any other exemption from the Securities Act, if available, or pursuant to subsequent registrations of our shares of common stock, may have a depressive effect upon the price of our shares of common stock in any active market that may develop.\nWe are a former \u201cshell company\u201d and as such are subject to certain limitations not applicable to other public companies generally.\nPrior to our suspension of reporting in 2012, we were a public reporting \u201cshell company,\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. Although we are no longer a \u201cshell company,\u201d we are subject to certain restrictions under the Securities Act for the resale of securities issued by issuers that have been at any time previously a shell company. Specifically, the Rule 144 safe harbor available for the resale of our restricted securities is only available to our stockholders if we have filed all reports and other materials required to be filed by Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as applicable, during the preceding twelve months, other than current reports on Form 8-K, at the time of the proposed sale, regardless of whether the restricted securities were initially issued at the time we were a shell company or subsequent to termination of such status. Accordingly, holders of our \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144 will be subject to the conditions set forth in Rule 144 with respect to our company. Other reporting companies that are not former shell companies and have been reporting for more than twelve months are not subject to this same reporting threshold for non-affiliate reliance on Rule 144. Accordingly, any restricted securities we have sold or sell in the future or issue to consultants or employees, in consideration for services rendered or for any other purpose, may not be resold unless such securities are registered with the SEC or the requirements of Rule 144 have been satisfied. As a result, it may be harder for us to fund our operations and pay our employees and consultants with our securities instead of cash. Furthermore, it may be harder for us to raise funding through the sale of debt or equity securities unless we agree to register such securities with the SEC, which could cause us to expend additional resources in the future. Our prior status as a \u201cshell company\u201d could prevent us in the future from raising additional funds, engaging employees and consultants, and using our securities to pay for any acquisitions, which could cause the value of our securities, if any, to decline in value or become worthless.", "PERMNO": 16179, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "MYSZ"}
