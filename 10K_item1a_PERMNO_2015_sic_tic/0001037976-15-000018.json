{"cik": "1037976", "company": "JONES LANG LASALLE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nGeneral Overview. Our business is complex, dynamic, entrepreneurial and international. Accordingly, it is subject to a number of significant risks in the ordinary course of its operations. If we cannot or do not successfully manage the risks associated with the services we provide, our operations, business, operating results, reputation and/or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOne of the challenges of a global business such as ours is to determine in a sophisticated manner the critical enterprise risks that exist or may newly develop over time as our business evolves. We must then determine how best to employ reasonably available resources to prevent, mitigate and/or minimize those risks that we are able to identify as having the greatest potential to cause significant damage from an operational, financial or reputational standpoint. An important dynamic we must also consider and appropriately manage is how much and what types of commercial insurance to obtain and how much potential liability may remain uninsured consistent with the infrastructure that is in place within the organization to identify and properly manage it.\nVarious factors over which we have no control significantly affect commercial real estate markets. These include (1) macro movements of the stock, bond, currency and derivatives markets; (2) the political environment; (3) government policy and regulations, in each case whether at local, national or international levels; and (4) the cost and availability of natural and non-renewable resources used to operate real estate. As an example, the severe financial disruption and global recession that occurred during 2008 and 2009 materially impacted global real estate markets as the volume and pace of commercial real estate transactions contracted and real estate pricing and leasing in many countries and markets fell substantially. More recently, the Russian geopolitical developments have significantly impacted the economy in that country, with no clear resolution in sight, and therefore the willingness for multi-national companies to expand their businesses. Although commercial real estate markets in most major cities were stable to improved during 2014, primarily as a result of the low interest rate environment that has been encouraged by the activities of various central banks, their continued recovery has in some cases remained uncertain for various reasons. These include (1) significant uncertainties arising out of the ongoing financial and political challenges within the European Union; (2) stubbornly high unemployment and underemployment and/or low middle-class wage growth around the world, including within the U.S and various European countries in particular; (3) the relative slow-down in certain\neconomies in Asia, including those of China and India; and (4) uncertainty added to the forecast for many economies, particularly in Russia and the Middle East, as the result of the sharp drop in oil and commodity prices later in 2014. Governments are responding to problematic situations in different and sometimes unpredictable and politically motivated ways. Accordingly, it is inherently difficult to make accurate predictions about the future movements in the markets in which we operate even as we did see continued improvement during 2014 and clear strength in the U.S. equities markets.\nGovernance over Enterprise Risk Management. We attempt to approach enterprise risk issues in a coordinated way across the globe. We govern our enterprise risk program primarily through our GOB, which includes our Global Chief Financial Officer, our business segment Chief Operating Officers and the leaders of our principal corporate staff groups: Finance, Legal Services, Accounting, Insurance, Human Resources, Tax, Marketing, Information Technology, Business Resumption, Professional Standards, Communications and Corporate Sustainability. The GOB coordinates its enterprise risk activities with our Internal Audit function, whose leadership attends GOB meetings and facilitates quarterly risk assessments of our business in order to determine where to focus its auditing and advisory efforts.\nOur Board of Directors and its Committees take active roles in overseeing management's identification and mitigation of the Company's enterprise risks. The Audit Committee focuses on the process by which management continuously identifies its enterprise risks and monitors the mitigation efforts that have been established. The Board focuses on substantive aspects of management's evaluation of our enterprise risks and the efforts we take to contain and mitigate them. Each of the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Governance Committee also monitors and discusses with management those risks that are inherent in the matters that are within each such Committee's purview.\nAs a standing agenda item for its quarterly meetings, the Audit Committee discusses with management the process that has been followed in order to establish an enterprise risk management report. This report reflects (1) the then current most significant enterprise risks that management believes the Company is facing; (2) the efforts management is taking to avoid or mitigate the identified risks; and (3) how the Company's internal audit function proposes to align its activities with the identified risks. The management representatives who regularly attend the Audit Committee meetings and participate in the preparation of the report and the discussion include our (1) Chief Financial Officer, (2) General Counsel and (3) Director of Internal Audit. At the meetings, the Director of Internal Audit reviews with the Committee how the report has informed the decisions about which aspects of the Company Internal Audit will review as part of its regular audit procedures, as well as how various programmatic activities by Internal Audit have been influenced by the conclusions drawn in the report.\nThe enterprise risk management report is provided to the full Board as a regular part of the materials for its quarterly meetings. At those meetings, the Board asks questions of management about the conclusions drawn in the enterprise risk management report and makes substantive comments and suggestions. Additionally, during the course of each year, the Audit Committee (or sometimes the full Board) meets directly on one or multiple occasions with the senior-most leaders of our critical corporate functions to consider, among other topics, the enterprise risks those internal organizations face and how they are managing and addressing them. At each Board meeting, the Chairman of our Audit Committee reports to the full Board on the activities of the Audit Committee, including with respect to its oversight of the enterprise risk management process. Given our level of acquisition activities, our Board receives periodic updates on the status of integrating new businesses and how we are attempting to mitigate the enterprise risks inherent in making acquisitions. We also discuss with the Board any lessons learned from the acquisitions we have completed and any processes or approaches we have changed or improved as a result.\nAs a regular part of its establishment of executive compensation, the Compensation Committee considers how the structuring of our compensation programs will affect risk-taking and the extent to which they will drive alignment with the long-term success of the enterprise and the interests of our shareholders.\nIn the normal course of its activities, our Nominating and Governance Committee reviews emerging best practices in corporate governance and stays abreast of changes in laws and regulations that affect the way we conduct our corporate governance, which represents another important aspect of overall enterprise risk management.\nRisk Mitigation Efforts. We do not attempt to discuss in this section all of the various significant efforts we employ to attempt to mitigate or contain the risks we identify, although we believe we have a robust program to do so in a systematic way. These efforts include (1) quarterly reviews by our GOB of operational errors and litigation situations so that we can consider whether there are steps we can take, such as changes to policies or additional staff training, that will prevent similar issues from recurring; (2) monthly reviews by our global team of Ethics Officers of internal ethics matters (starting in 2014, including the cost of investigating and resolving them) and general external ethics issues as well as consideration of whether there are new or different activities we can establish within our Ethics Everywhere program in order to proactively address them; and (3) the activities by our Director of Professional Standards to coordinate enterprise risk mitigation and prevention among the business, our internal auditors and our other corporate staff functions. One of the workstreams for the implementation of our Strategy\n2020 Project, discussed in more detail above under \"Company Overview,\" is our \"Getting Safely to 2020\" Program, by which we are seeking to instill across all of our business lines more consistent approaches to certain risk mitigation and governance techniques.\nSeeking Opportunities in Risks. Risks in business can also mean opportunity if they can be translated into services that help clients mitigate their own risks and for which they are willing to pay fees that adequately compensate the provider for the risks being absorbed. An example of how we may be able to monetize the absorption of risks is our ability to charge fees for taking on, as principal, the risks of performance of subcontractors so that our clients do not have to bear them directly. Another example is our experience and ability to conduct business with integrity in emerging markets that are generally perceived to be less transparent, which allows us to charge fees to multi-national companies that want to expand their footprint into new markets with the assistance of service providers they can trust to protect their interests and act according to ethical and other best practices.\nCategorization of Enterprise Risks. This section reflects our current views concerning the most significant risks we believe our business faces, both in the short-term and the long-term. We do not, however, purport to include every possible risk from which we might sustain a loss. For purposes of the following analysis and discussion, we generally group the risks we face according to four principal categories:\n\u2022\nExternal Market Risk Factors;\n\u2022\nInternal Operational Risk Factors;\n\u2022\nFinancial Risk Factors; and\n\u2022\nHuman Resources Risk Factors.\nWe could appropriately place some of the risks we identify in more than one category, but we have chosen the one we view as primary. We do not necessarily present the risks below in their order of significance, the relative likelihood that we will experience a loss or the magnitude of any such loss. Certain of these risks also may give rise to business opportunities for the Firm, but our discussion of risk factors in Item 1A is limited to the adverse effects the risks may have on our business.\nExternal Market Risk Factors\nGENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND REAL ESTATE MARKET CONDITIONS CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.\nReal estate markets are inherently cyclical. They correlate strongly to local and national economic and political conditions or, at least, to the perceptions and confidence of investors and users as to the relevant economic outlook. For example, corporations may be hesitant to expand space or enter into long-term commitments if they are concerned about the general economic environment. Corporations that are under individual financial pressure for any reason, or are attempting to more aggressively manage their expenses, may (1) reduce the size of their workforces, (2) reduce spending on capital expenditures, including with respect to their offices, (3) permit more of their staff to work from home offices, and/or (4) seek corresponding reductions in office space and related management services.\nWe have previously experienced, and expect in the future that we will be negatively impacted by, periods of economic slowdown or recession and corresponding declines in the demand for real estate and related services. The global economic crisis during the 2007-2009 period was extraordinary for its worldwide scope, severity and impact on major financial institutions, as well as the extent of governmental stimulus and regulatory responses. During the 2011-2014 period, the inability of the European Union to effect a sustainable resolution of the financial and political instability of certain of its member countries has prevented the return of a healthy level of confidence to its market, with some exacerbation of these issues resulting from the geopolitical uncertainty generated by the Russia, Crimea and Ukraine situation. Structural and political issues have similarly restrained a robust recovery in the United States, which has experienced gradual employment growth but wage stagnations, and have resulted in inconsistent and less robust development of certain Asian markets, including in China and India, although the business climate has improved in India during 2014 with the election of a government perceived to be more pro-business. We have been able to continue to grow our business largely by gaining market share and as the result of targeted acquisitions. We have been able to take advantage of the buoyant capital markets that have resulted from continued central bank-influenced low interest rates, and in 2014 the leasing markets also recovered generally within central business districts, where we are an historically strong participant. These dynamics have been favorable to our LaSalle business too, particularly as they have helped us raise new capital to invest and sell properties into strong markets, which benefits our clients and generates incentive fees and equity earnings. On the other hand, our business in Russia and Ukraine has been negatively\nimpacted by the general economic and political situation in those countries although our revenues from them represent a small portion of our total global revenues.\nThe speed with which markets change, both positively and negatively, has accelerated due to the increased global interconnectivity that has resulted from the immediacy and availability of information permitted by the Internet and social media, among other reasons. This has added to the challenges of anticipating and quickly adapting to changes in business and revenue, particularly since real estate transactions are inherently complicated and longer-term in nature. A recent example has been the fast drop in oil prices that occurred at the end of 2014, which has complex potential ramifications in many of the countries in which we conduct business, although it is unclear how they will ultimately filter through to our specific markets.\nNegative economic conditions and declines in the demand for real estate and related services in several markets or in significant markets could have a material adverse effect as a result of the following factors:\n\u2022\nDecline in Acquisition and Disposition Activity\nA general decline in acquisition and disposition activity for commercial real estate can lead to a reduction in the fees and commissions we receive for arranging such transactions, as well as in fees and commissions we earn for arranging financing for acquirers. This can affect both our Capital Markets business in our RES segments as well as our LaSalle business, although not necessarily always negatively. For example, credit contractions such as those that took place during the recent global financial crisis, negatively impact real estate pricing and transaction volumes, which will reduce our Capital Markets fees. Additionally, a continued bias by investors toward conservatism means that their appetite for core investment products, which is a LaSalle strength, remains noticeably higher than for opportunistic or speculative products.\n\u2022\nDecline in the Real Estate Values and Performance, Leasing Activity and Rental Rates\nA general decline in the value and performance of real estate and in rental rates can lead to a reduction in both (1) investment management fees, a significant portion of which is generally based upon the performance of investments and net asset values, and (2) the value of the co-investments we make with our investment management clients or merchant banking investments we have made for our own account. Additionally, such declines can lead to a reduction in fees and commissions that are based on the value of, or revenue produced by, the properties with respect to which we provide services. This may include fees and commissions (1) for property management and valuations, (2) generated by our Capital Markets, Hotels and other businesses for arranging acquisitions, dispositions and financings, and (3) for arranging leasing transactions. Such declines can also lead to an unwillingness or inability of clients to make new (or honor existing) capital commitments to funds sponsored by our investment management business, which can result in a decline of both investment management fees and incentive fees and can also restrict our ability to employ capital for new investments in current funds or establish new funds.\nThe general decline in the value and performance of real estate negatively impacted the value of our own co-investments during 2009 and 2010. As real estate markets have generally improved since 2010, we have seen the value of these investments return, as reflected in the increase in our equity earnings recognized over the last four years. The continued conservatism of corporate occupiers to commit to new space, and their desire to derive more productivity from the same, or a sometimes reduced, real estate footprint, made our Agency Leasing business more challenging during 2013 but it recovered during 2014 as low interest rates and the strength of the U.S. equity markets brought confidence back to corporate occupiers.\nHistorically for companies in our industry, a significant decline in real estate values in a given market has also generally tended to result in increased litigation and claims regarding advisory and valuation work done prior to the decline, as well as pressure from investment management clients regarding performance.\n\u2022\nDecline in Value of Real Estate Securities\nA general decline in the value of real estate securities (for example, REITS) will have a negative effect on the value of the portfolios that our LaSalle business manages, and any securities held in accounts that LaSalle manages, and therefore the fees we earn on assets under management. In addition, a general decline in the value of real estate securities could negatively impact the amount of money that investors are willing to allocate to real estate securities and the pace of engaging new investor clients.\n\u2022\nCyclicality in the Real Estate Markets; Lag in Recovery Relative to Broader Markets\nCyclicality in the real estate markets may lead to cyclicality in our earnings and significant volatility in our stock price, which in recent years has continued to be highly sensitive to market perception of the global economy generally and our industry specifically. Real estate markets are also thought to \"lag\" the broader economy. This means that even when underlying economic fundamentals improve in a given market, it may take additional time for these improvements to translate into strength in the real estate markets. This may be exacerbated when banks delay their resolution of commercial real estate assets whose values are less than their associated loans.\n\u2022\nEffect of Changes in Non-Real Estate Markets\nChanges in non-real estate markets can also affect our business in different ways for different types of investors. For example, relative strength in the equity markets can lead certain investors to lower the level of capital allocated to real estate, which in turn can mean that our ability to generate fees from the operation of our investment management business will be negatively impacted. Strength in the equity markets can also negatively impact the perception of relative performance of real estate as an asset class, which in turn means that the incentive fees relating to the performance of our investment funds will be negatively impacted. For those investors who seek to maintain real estate as a relatively fixed percentage of their portfolios and will periodically rebalance in order to do so, the so-called \"denominator effect\" can lead to either (1) selling real estate when the equity markets are weak since that can make real estate investments too great of a proportion of their portfolios or (2) buying real estate when equity markets are strong in order to maintain the desired percentage relative to other assets. A low interest rate environment, such as we have experienced in recent years, can make yields from real estate more attractive compared to bonds and that has supported REIT stocks.\nREAL ESTATE SERVICES AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT MARKETS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.\nWe provide a broad range of commercial real estate and investment management services. There is significant competition on an international, regional and local level with respect to many of these services and in commercial real estate services generally. Depending on the service, we face competition from other real estate service providers, institutional lenders, insurance companies, investment banking firms, investment managers, accounting firms, technology firms, consulting firms, firms providing outsourcing of various types (including technology, and building products), any of which may be a global, regional or local firm, and companies that self-provide their real estate services with in-house capabilities.\nMany of our competitors are local or regional firms. Although they may be substantially smaller in overall size than we are, they may be larger than we are in a specific local or regional market. Some of our competitors have expanded the services they offer in an attempt to gain additional business. Some may be providing outsourced facility management services in order to sell products to clients (such as HVAC systems) that we do not offer. In some sectors of our business, particularly Corporate Solutions, some of our competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, and more established relationships with their customers and suppliers than we have. Larger or better-capitalized competitors in those sectors may be able to respond faster to the need for technological changes, price their services more aggressively, compete more effectively for skilled professionals, finance acquisitions more easily, develop innovative products more effectively and generally compete more aggressively for market share. This can also lead to increasing commoditization of the services we provide and increasing downward pressure on the fees we can charge.\nNew competitors, or alliances among competitors that increase their ability to service clients, could emerge and gain market share, develop a lower cost structure, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, aggressively recruit our people at above-market compensation or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services we offer. Some of these may come from non-traditional sources, such as information aggregators. In order to respond to increased competition and pricing pressure, we may have to lower our prices, loosen contractual terms (such as liability limitations), develop our own innovative approaches to mining data and using information, or increase compensation, which may have an adverse effect on our revenue and profit margins. We may also need to become increasingly productive and efficient in the way we deliver services or with respect to the cost structure supporting our businesses, which may in turn require more innovative uses of technology as well as data gathering and data mining.\nOur industry has continued to consolidate, as evidenced by alliances in recent history that have resulted in the Grubb Newmark Knight Frank business and the merger between DTZ and Cassidy Turley, both of which included firms that had previously had significant financial problems but were able to recapitalize and reposition themselves. There is an inherent risk that competitive firms may be more successful than we are at growing through merger and acquisition activity. While we have successfully grown organically and through a series of acquisitions, sourcing and completing acquisitions are complex and sensitive activities. In light of the continuing need to provide clients with more comprehensive services on a more productive and cost efficient basis, we expect increasing acquisition opportunities to emerge and may increase our acquisition activity compared to recent years. For example, in 2011 we completed the significant acquisition of King Sturge in Europe after having considerably slowed our acquisition activity from 2008 through 2010. During 2012, 2013 and 2014, we completed four, five, and ten acquisitions, respectively. We are considering, and will continue to consider, acquisitions that we believe will strengthen our market position, increase our profitability and supplement our organic growth. We have found it relatively more challenging to identify appropriate acquisition candidates in our investment management business than we have been able to do in our RES business. In any event, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue our acquisition activity in the future at the same pace as we have in the past.\nWe believe we emerged from the global economic downturn in a stronger financial and market share position relative to certain of our traditional competitors. This may in some cases lead to a willingness on the part of a competitor to engage in aggressive pricing, advertising or hiring practices in order to maintain market shares or client relationships. To the extent this occurs, it increases the competitive risks and the fee and compensation pressures we face, although ramifications will differ from one competitor to another given their different positions within the marketplace and their different financial situations.\nWe are substantially dependent on long-term client relationships and on revenue received for services under various service agreements. Many of these agreements may be canceled by the client for any reason with as little as 30 to 60 days' notice, as is typical in the industry. In this competitive market, if we are unable to maintain these relationships or are otherwise unable to retain existing clients and develop new clients, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition may be materially adversely affected. The global economic downturn and continued weaknesses in the markets in which they themselves compete have led to additional pricing pressure from clients as they themselves came under financial pressure, participated in governmental bail-out programs or filed for bankruptcy or insolvency protection, as some significant clients did. These effects have continued to moderate through 2014, but they could increase again in the wake of the continuing political and economic uncertainties within the European Union, the United States, China, India, Russia or the Middle East, including as a result of the uncertain results of significantly lower oil prices.\nREPUTATIONAL AND BRAND RISKS.\nThe value and premium status of our brand is one of our most important assets. An inherent risk in maintaining our brand is that we may fail to successfully differentiate the scope and quality of our service and product offerings from those of our competitors, or that we may fail to sufficiently innovate or develop improved products or services that will be attractive to our clients. Additionally, given the rigors of the competitive marketplace in which we operate, there is the risk that we may not be able to continue to find ways to operate more productively and more cost-effectively, including by achieving economies of scale, or that we will be limited in our ability to further reduce the costs required to operate on a globally coordinated platform.\nThe dynamic nature of the Internet and social media, which have substantially increased the availability and transparency of information, could devalue the information that we gather and disseminate as part of our business model and may harm certain aspects of our brokerage business in the event that principals of transactions prefer to transact directly with each other. In this regard, we face potential disintermediation challenges from companies whose primary business is to aggregate and disseminate for compensation the listing information they obtain from firms like ours that represent commercial landlords offering space to let.\nThe rapid dissemination and increasing transparency of information, particularly for public companies, increases the risks to our business that could result from negative media or announcements about ethics lapses or other operational problems, which could lead clients to terminate or reduce their relationships with us. We are also subject to misappropriation of one of the names or trademarks we own by third parties that do not have the right to use them so that they can trade off of the goodwill we have built up in our intellectual property, and our efforts to police usage of our intellectual property may not be successful in all situations.\nTHE SEASONALITY OF OUR REAL ESTATE SERVICES BUSINESS EXPOSES US TO RISKS.\nWithin our Real Estate Services business, our revenue and profits have historically grown progressively by quarter throughout the year. This is a result of a general focus in the real estate industry on completing or documenting transactions by fiscal-year-end and the fact that certain of our expenses are constant through the year. Historically, we have reported a relatively smaller profit in the first quarter and then increasingly larger profit during each of the following three quarters, excluding the recognition of investment-generated performance fees and co-investment equity gains or losses (each of which can be particularly unpredictable).\nThe seasonality of our business makes it difficult to determine during the course of the year whether planned results will be achieved, and thus to adjust to changes in expectations. Additionally, negative economic or other conditions that arise at a time when they impact performance in the fourth quarter, such as the particular timing of when larger transactions close or changes in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, may have a more significant impact than if they occurred earlier in the year. To the extent we are not able to identify and adjust for changes in expectations or we are confronted with negative conditions that inordinately impact the fourth quarter of a calendar year, we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nAs a result of growth in our property management and integrated facility management businesses and other services related to the growth of outsourcing of corporate real estate services, there has been somewhat less seasonality in our revenue and profits\nduring the past few years than there was historically, but we believe that some level of seasonality will always be inherent in our industry and outside of our control. We continued to experience a level of seasonality in 2014 that was similar to previous years. We are unable to predict whether the dynamic nature of the markets in which we operate, or any change in their economic or political structures, will have a material effect on the historical seasonality of our business in 2015 and beyond.\nPOLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INSTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY: PROTECTIONISM; TERRORIST ACTIVITIES; HEALTH EPIDEMICS.\nWe provide services in over 80 countries with varying degrees of political and economic stability and transparency. For example, within the past few years certain Middle Eastern, Asian, European and South American countries have experienced serious political and economic instability that will likely continue to arise from time to time in countries in which we have operations. It is difficult for us to predict where or when a significant change in the political leadership or regime within a given country may occur, or what the implications of such a change will be on our operations given that legislative, regulatory, tax and business environments can be altered quickly and dramatically. For example, continuing political activities in Russia and separately in various Middle Eastern countries have significantly disrupted business activity in those countries. Also, in recent years there have been significant political changes in a number of countries, including the U.S. and India as examples, resulting in changes to financial, tax, healthcare, governance and other laws that may directly affect our business and continue to evolve. Starting in the second half of 2011, debate arose about the continued viability of the European Union and the euro currency, and uncertainties remain about how this situation may ultimately be resolved.\nOur ability to operate our business in the ordinary course and our willingness to commit new resources or investments may be affected or disrupted in one way or another, such as reductions in revenue, increases in taxes (due to more aggressive taxation policies), increases in other expenses (such as with respect to employee healthcare), restrictions on repatriating funds, difficulties in collecting receivables from clients, difficulties in recruiting staff, increased corruption or other material adverse effects.\nIn the event that governments engage in protectionist policies which favor local firms over foreign firms or which restrict cross-border capital flows, our ability to utilize and benefit from our global platform and integrated business model could be adversely affected. The global downturn also significantly added to the deficit spending of certain governments in countries where we do business and has called into question the creditworthiness of some countries, which has not entirely gone away as an issue. More recently, particularly in Europe, governments instituted austerity programs in an effort to contract spending and avoid defaults on sovereign debt, some of which resulted in social unrest. The social unrest as the result of the implementation of the austerity programs has diminished and some European countries seem to have emerged successfully. There has been some speculation that one or more European countries may stop using the euro as its currency. The United States and the European Union have instituted various sanctions against Russia as a result of that country's actions with respect to Ukraine and Crimea. It is inherently difficult to predict what the consequences to our business may be from these situations as they develop further.\nIn addition, terrorist activities have escalated in recent years and at times have affected cities in which we operate. The 2008 terrorist attack in Mumbai, India, where we have a presence, is an example and there have been serious situations in other cities where we have operations, including London, Boston, Paris, Sydney, Ottawa and Moscow. To the extent that similar terrorist activities continue to occur, they may adversely affect our business because they tend to target the same type of high-profile urban areas in which we do business.\nHealth epidemics that affect the general conduct of business in one or more urban areas (including as the result of travel restrictions and the inability to conduct face-to-face meetings), such as occurred in the past from SARS and influenza, or may occur in the future from other types of outbreak, can also adversely affect the volume of business transactions, real estate markets and the cost of operating real estate or providing real estate services. During 2014 the Ebola epidemic in certain countries in Africa caused significant concern globally, although so far it has been contained within Africa.\nThe increasing globalization by our multi-national clients creates pressure to further expand our own geographical reach into less developed countries, including for example within Africa, which tends to exacerbate the above risks. As we continue to provide services in countries that have relatively higher security risks and lower levels of transparency, our exposure to the risks inherent in doing business in less developed markets increases.\nINFRASTRUCTURE DISRUPTIONS.\nOur ability to conduct a global business may be adversely impacted by disruptions to the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located. This may include disruptions involving electrical, communications,\ninformation technology, transportation or other services used by JLL or third parties with which we conduct business. It may also include disruptions as a result of natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, political instability, general labor strikes or turmoil, cyber-attacks or terrorist attacks. These disruptions may occur, for example, as a result of events affecting only the buildings in which we operate (such as fires), or as a result of events with a broader impact on the cities where those buildings are located (including, potentially, the longer-term effects of global climate change). Nearly all of our employees in our primary locations, including Chicago, London, Singapore and Sydney, work in close proximity to each other in one or more buildings. If a disruption occurs in one location and our employees in that location are unable to communicate with or travel to other locations, our ability to service and interact with our clients may suffer, and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel.\nThe infrastructure disruptions we describe above may also disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of real estate investments we make on behalf of clients. The buildings we manage for clients, which include some of the world's largest office properties and retail centers, are used by numerous people daily. As a result, fires, earthquakes, floods, other natural disasters, defects and terrorist attacks can result in significant loss of life, and, to the extent we are held to have been negligent in connection with our management of the affected properties, we could incur significant financial liabilities and reputational harm. An example during 2012 was Hurricane Sandy, which disrupted our own operations in the Northeast United States and caused significant flooding damage to buildings we manage for clients in lower Manhattan, some of which took significant periods of time to recover fully. During 2013 and 2014, Asia experienced significant, and in some cases unprecedented, typhoon activity.\nThe occurrence of natural disasters and terrorist attacks can also significantly impact the availability and/or cost of commercial insurance policies covering real estate, both for our own business and for those clients whose properties we manage and who may purchase their insurance through the insurance buying programs we make available to them. Sometimes, even where policies are available, specific coverage for wind, flooding, earthquakes or terrorism may not be available or may be very expensive.\nThere can be no assurance that the disaster recovery and crisis management procedures we employ will suffice in any particular situation to avoid a significant loss. Given that our staff is increasingly mobile and less reliant on physical presence in a Company office, our disaster recovery plans increasingly rely on the availability of the Internet (including \"cloud\" technology) and mobile phone technology, so the disruption of those systems, such as because of a cyber-attack, would likely affect our ability to recover promptly from a crisis situation. Additionally, our ability to foresee or mitigate the potential consequences to managed properties, and real estate generally, from the effects of climate change, may be limited. We have significant operations and client relationships in cities with coastal exposure, such as New York and Florida.\nCIVIL AND REGULATORY CLAIMS; LITIGATING DISPUTES IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS.\nSubstantial civil legal liability or a significant regulatory action against our Firm could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. Many legal systems, including in the United States, have fairly significant barriers against recovering legal fees from plaintiffs that file cases we consider frivolous, so the costs to us of defending such cases can be substantial even if we prevail.\nWhile we maintain commercial insurance in an amount we believe is appropriate, we also maintain a significant level of self-insurance for the liabilities we may incur. Although we place our commercial insurance with only highly-rated companies, the value of otherwise valid claims we hold under insurance policies may become uncollectible due to the insolvency of the applicable insurance company.\nAdditionally, the claims we have can be complex and insurance companies can prove difficult or bureaucratic in resolving claims, which may result in payments to us being delayed or reduced or that we must litigate in order to enforce an insurance policy claim.\nAny disputes we have with third parties, or any government regulatory matters, generally must be adjudicated within the jurisdiction in which the dispute arose. Therefore, our ability to resolve our disputes successfully depends on the local laws that apply and the operation of the local judicial system. The timeliness, quality, transparency, integrity and sophistication of judicial systems vary widely from one jurisdiction to the next. Our geographic diversity therefore may expose us to disputes in certain jurisdictions that could be challenging to resolve efficiently and/or effectively, particularly as there appears to be an increasing tendency toward litigation in emerging markets, where the rule of law is less reliable, legal systems are less mature and transparent and the potential for judicial corruption remains a practical reality. It also may be more difficult to collect\nreceivables from clients who do not pay their bills in certain jurisdictions, since resorting to the judicial system in certain countries may not be an effective alternative given the delays and costs involved.\nInternal Operational Risk Factors\nCONCENTRATIONS OF BUSINESS WITH CORPORATE AND INVESTOR CLIENTS CAUSES INCREASED CREDIT RISK AND GREATER IMPACT FROM THE LOSS OF CERTAIN CLIENTS; INCREASED RISKS FROM HIGHER LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN CONTRACTS.\nWhile our client base remains highly diversified across industries and geographies, we value the expansion of business relationships with individual corporate clients and institutional investors because of the increased efficiency and economics (both to our clients and our Firm) that can result from developing repeat business from the same client and from performing an increasingly broad range of services for the same client. Having increasingly large and concentrated clients also can lead to greater or more concentrated risks of loss if, among other possibilities, such a client (1) experiences its own financial problems, which can lead to larger individual credit risks, (2) becomes bankrupt or insolvent, which can lead to our failure to be paid for services we have previously provided or funds we have previously advanced, (3) decides to reduce its operations or its real estate facilities, (4) makes a change in its real estate strategy, such as no longer outsourcing its real estate operations, (5) decides to change its providers of real estate services or (6) merges with another corporation or otherwise undergoes a change of control, which may result in new management taking over with a different real estate philosophy or in different relationships with other real estate providers. In the case of LaSalle, concentration of investor clients can lead to fewer sources of investment capital, which can negatively affect assets under management in case a higher-volume client withdraws its funds or does not re-invest them. This is also the case within LaSalle's securities business and for Jones Lang LaSalle Income Property Trust, Inc., which are both dependent on the continued ability and willingness of certain brokerage firms to attract investment funds from their clients.\nAdditionally, competitive conditions, particularly in connection with increasingly large clients may require us to compromise on certain contract terms with respect to the payment of fees, the extent of risk transfer, acting as principal rather than agent in connection with supplier relationships, liability limitations and other contractual terms, or in connection with disputes or potential litigation. Where competitive pressures result in higher levels of potential liability under our contracts, the cost of operational errors and other activities for which we have indemnified our clients will be greater and may not be fully insured.\nThe global economic downturn was an example of how risks to our organization increased as the result of the significant financial distress (which in some cases led to bankruptcy or insolvency) it placed on many organizations, including some that are clients of ours. Some of our largest clients include companies in the financial services industry, such as commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies, and companies in the auto industry, which were significantly impacted by the global economic downturn and took a number of years to recover. Political and financial issues in the European Union have continued to negatively impact the financial condition of companies conducting significant operations in European countries as the result of contractions in government spending, reduced liquidity from banks and social unrest. More recently, actions taken by Russia with respect to Crimea and Ukraine have led to economic sanctions by the United States and the European Union against Russia, which have impacted the Russian economy and the ability and willingness of businesses in that country to continue to conduct business.\nWhere we provide services to firms in the financial services industry, including banks and investment banks, we are experiencing indirectly the increasing extent of the regulatory environment to which they are subject in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. This increases the cost of doing business with them, which we are not always able to pass on, as the result of the additional resources and processes we are required to provide as a critical supplier.\nCONTRACTUAL LIABILITIES AS PRINCIPAL AND FOR WARRANTED PRICING.\nWe may, on behalf of our clients, hire and supervise third-party contractors to provide construction, engineering and various other services for properties we are managing or developing on behalf of clients. Depending upon (1) the terms of our contracts with clients, which, for example, may place us in the position of a principal rather than an agent, or (2) the responsibilities we assume or are legally deemed to have assumed in the course of a client engagement (whether or not memorialized in a contract), we may be subjected to, or become liable for, claims for construction defects, negligent performance of work or other similar actions by third parties we do not control.\nAdverse outcomes of property management disputes or litigation could negatively impact our business, operating results and/or financial condition, particularly if we have not limited in our contracts the extent of damages to which we may be liable for the consequences of our actions, or if our liabilities exceed the amounts of the commercial third-party insurance that we carry.\nMoreover, our clients may seek to hold us accountable for the actions of contractors because of our role as property manager even if we have technically disclaimed liability as a legal matter, in which case we may find it commercially prudent to participate in a financial settlement for purposes of preserving the client relationship.\nActing as a principal may also mean that we pay a contractor before we have been reimbursed by the client, which exposes us to additional risks of collection from the client in the event of an intervening bankruptcy or insolvency of the client. The reverse can occur as well, where a contractor we have paid files bankruptcy or commits fraud with the funds before completing a project for which we have paid it in part or in full. As part of our project management business, we may enter into agreements with clients that provide for a warranted or guaranteed cost for a project that we manage. In these situations, we are responsible for managing the various other contractors required for a project, including general contractors, in order to ensure that the cost of a project does not exceed the contract price and that the project is completed on time. In the event that one of the other contractors on the project does not or cannot perform as a result of bankruptcy or for some other reason, we may be responsible for any cost overruns as well as the consequences for late delivery. In the event that for whatever reason we have not accurately estimated our own costs of providing services under warranted or guaranteed cost contracts, we may lose money on such contracts until such time as we can legally terminate them. Also, the application of indirect taxes, such as sales taxes, goods and services taxes, and value added taxes may be less clear for these agreements, potentially impacting our margins.\nDuring an economic downturn in a given country or region generally, we would expect to experience credit-related problems at a higher level than usual with vendors and contractors due to their increased financial instability. For example, this became a reality during the global financial crisis.\nPERFORMANCE AND FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS UNDER CLIENT CONTRACTS; REVENUE RECOGNITION; SCOPE CREEP; RISING COST OF INSURANCE RESULTING FROM NEGLIGENCE CLAIMS.\nIn certain cases we are subject to fiduciary obligations to our clients, which may result in a higher level of legal obligation compared to basic contractual obligations. These relate to, among other matters, the decisions we make on behalf of a client with respect to managing assets on its behalf or purchasing products or services from third parties or other divisions within our Firm. Our services may involve handling substantial amounts of client funds in connection with managing their properties. They may also involve complicated and high-profile transactions which involve significant amounts of money. We face legal and reputational risks in the event we do not perform, or are perceived to have not performed, under those contracts or in accordance with those obligations, or in the event we are negligent in the handling of client funds or in the way in which we have delivered our professional services.\nWe have certain business lines, such as valuations and lease administration, where the size of the transactions we handle is much greater than the fees we generate from them. As a result, the consequences of errors that lead to damages can be disproportionately large in the event our contractual protections or our insurance coverage are inadequate to protect us fully.\nThe precautions we take to prevent these types of occurrences, which represent a significant commitment of corporate resources, may nevertheless be ineffective in certain cases. Unexpected costs or delays could make our client contracts or engagements less profitable than anticipated. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could have an adverse effect on profit margins.\nIn the event we perform services for clients without executing sufficient contractual documentation, we may be unable to realize our full compensation potential or recognize revenue for accounting purposes, and we may not be able to effectively limit our liability in the event of client disputes. If we perform services for clients that are beyond, or different from, what were originally contemplated in the governing contracts (known as \"scope creep\"), we may not be fully reimbursed for the services provided, or our potential liability in the case of a negligence claim may not have been as limited as it normally would have been or may be unclear.\nIf we make a large insurance claim on our professional indemnity policy due to a situation involving our negligence, we would expect subsequent premiums to increase materially, the size of deductibles we are required to retain could increase substantially and the availability of future coverage could be negatively impacted.\nCO-INVESTMENT, INVESTMENT, MERCHANT BANKING AND REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT BANKING ACTIVITIES.\nAn important part of our investment strategy includes investing in real estate, both individually and along with our investment management clients. As of December 31, 2014, we have potential unfunded commitment obligations of $176.2 million to fund\nfuture co-investments. In order to remain competitive with well-capitalized financial services firms, we also may make merchant banking investments for which we may use Firm capital to acquire properties before the related investment management funds have been established or investment commitments have been received from third-party clients. A strategy that we have not pursued vigorously, but that still has potential, is to further engage in certain real estate investment banking activities in which we, either solely or with one or more joint venture partners, would employ capital to assist our clients in maximizing the value of their real estate. For example, we might acquire a property from a client that wishes to dispose of it within a certain time frame, after which we would market it for sale as the principal and therefore assume any related market risk.\nWe also operate business lines that have as part of their strategy the acquisition, development, management and sale of real estate. Investing in any of these types of situations exposes us to a number of risks.\nInvesting in real estate for the above reasons poses the following risks:\n\u2022\nWe may lose some or all of the capital that we invest if the investments underperform. Real estate investments can underperform as the result of many factors outside of our control, including the general reduction in asset values within a particular geography or asset class. Starting in 2007 and continuing through 2009, for example, real estate prices in many markets throughout the world declined generally as the result of the significant tightening of the credit markets and the effects of recessionary economies and significant unemployment. We recognized impairment charges of $2.4 million, $6.5 million, and $7.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, primarily representing our co-investment share of the impairment charges against individual assets held by our real estate ventures. In contrast, as real estate investments benefited from benign interest rate environments globally and continuing recovery in many of our markets, for the year ended December 31, 2014 we recognized equity earnings from our co-investments of $48.3 million.\n\u2022\nWe will have fluctuations in earnings and cash flow as we recognize gains or losses, and receive cash, upon the disposition of investments, the timing of which is geared toward the benefit of our clients.\n\u2022\nWe generally hold our investments in real estate through subsidiaries with limited liability; however, in certain circumstances, it is possible that this limited exposure may be expanded in the future based on, among other things, changes in applicable laws. To the extent this occurs, our liability could exceed the amount we have invested.\n\u2022\nWe make co-investments in real estate in many countries, and this presents risks as described above in \"External Market Risk Factors.\" This may include changes to tax treaties, tax policy, foreign investment policy or other local political or legislative changes that may adversely affect the performance of our co-investments. The global economic downturn increased the chances of significant changes in government policies generally, the effects of which are inherently difficult to predict. The financial pressures on government entities that have resulted from weak economies and deficit spending may lead taxing authorities to more aggressively pursue taxes and question tax strategies and positions.\n\u2022\nWe generally make co-investments in the local currency of the country in which the investment asset exists. We will therefore be subject to the risks described below under \"Currency Restrictions and Exchange Rate Fluctuations.\"\nIn certain situations, although they have been relatively limited historically, we raise funds from outside investors where we are the sponsor of real estate investments, developments or projects. To the extent we return less than the investors' original investments because the investments, developments or projects have underperformed relative to expectations, the investors could attempt to recoup the full amount of their investments under securities law theories such as lack of adequate disclosure when funds were initially raised. Sponsoring funds into which retail investors are able to invest may increase this risk.\nCORPORATE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.\nAll providers of professional services to clients, including our Firm, must manage potential conflicts of interest. This occurs principally where the primary duty of loyalty we owe to one client may potentially be weakened or compromised by a relationship we also maintain with another client or third party. Corporate conflicts of interest arise in the context of the services we provide as a Firm to our different clients. Personal conflicts of interest on the part of our employees are separately considered as issues within the context of our Code of Business Ethics. The failure or inability of the Firm to identify, disclose and resolve potential conflicts of interest in a significant situation could have a material adverse effect.\nAn example of a potential conflict of interest situation is that in the ordinary course of its business, LaSalle hires property managers for the investment properties it holds on behalf of clients. In that case, it may hire JLL to provide such services or it may hire a firm that is a competitor of JLL. In the event it retains JLL, it may appear to have a conflict of interest with respect\nto the selection. As a fiduciary with respect to its client funds, LaSalle resolves such potential conflicts by acting independently of JLL and following certain internal procedures designed to select the service provider that can best represent the interests of the investment management client or fund.\nAnother example is that in certain countries, based upon applicable regulations and local market dynamics, we have established joint ventures or other arrangements with insurance brokers through which insurance coverage is offered to clients, tenants in buildings we manage and vendors to those buildings. Although we fully disclose our arrangements and do not require anyone to use the insurance services, JLL has a financial interest in the placement of insurance with such third parties and therefore we may be deemed to have certain conflicts of interest.\nThere are occasions when one JLL team represents the landlord of a building in leasing its space and a separate JLL team represents a tenant that is considering, or selects, space in that building. In those situations, we fully disclose our dual roles to both clients, obtain their informed consent to continue and put \"ethical wall\" and other protections in place (such as ring-fenced compensation protocols) so that each client benefits from the zealous representation by its JLL team.\nAfter reductions in the market values of the underlying properties, firms engaged in the business of providing valuations are inherently subject to a higher risk of claims with respect to conflicts of interest based on the circumstances of valuations they previously issued. Regardless of the ultimate merits of these claims, the allegations themselves can cause reputational damage and can be expensive to defend in terms of counsel fees and otherwise.\nCLIENT AND VENDOR DUE DILIGENCE.\nThere are circumstances where the conduct or identity of our clients could cause us reputational damage or financial harm or could lead to our non-compliance with certain laws. An example would be the attempt by a client to \"launder\" funds through its relationship with us, namely to disguise the illegal source of funds that are put into otherwise legitimate real estate investments. Additional examples are (1) our inadvertently doing business with a client that has been listed on one of the \"prohibited persons\" lists now issued by many governments around the world and (2) our inadvertently doing business with a private client or governmental entity within a country that is prohibited under applicable regulations such as those published in the United States by the Office of Foreign Asset Control (\"OFAC\"). We may also from time to time legally invest the sovereign wealth funds of a government entity client which is subsequently deemed to be inappropriate either from a reputational or legal standpoint.\nSimilar problems can arise with respect to the vendors or suppliers we hire to provide services or products to us or for our clients. In the normal course of business, we spend significant amounts in order to purchase goods and services for the properties we manage on behalf of clients. An example would be an intermediary that makes illegal payments on our behalf or on behalf of a client, even where contrary to our stated policies and to our specific agreement with such intermediary, under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or the U.K. Bribery Act.\nOur efforts to evaluate clients, vendors and government entities before doing business with them in order not to do business with a prohibited party, or within a prohibited country, and to avoid attempts to launder money, make bribery payments or otherwise to exploit their relationship with us may not be successful in all situations since compliance for a business such as ours is very complex and also since we take a risk-based approach to the procedures we have employed. The ability to conduct diligence is inherently diminished in less developed countries with lower level of transparency and fewer public records. Additionally, it is not always possible to accurately determine the ultimate owners or control persons within our clients' organizations or other entities with which we do business, particularly if they are actively attempting to hide such information from regulatory authorities. We may therefore unknowingly be doing business with entities that are otherwise involved in illegal activities that do not involve us or that are ultimately controlled by persons with whom engaging in business has been prohibited by applicable regulatory authorities.\nBURDEN OF COMPLYING WITH MULTIPLE AND POTENTIALLY CONFLICTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND DEALING WITH CHANGES IN LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.\nWe face a broad range of legal and regulatory environments in the countries in which we do business. Coordinating our activities to deal with these requirements presents significant challenges. For example, in the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") regulates the conduct of investment businesses and the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (\"RICS\") regulates the profession of Chartered Surveyors, which is the professional qualification required for certain of the services we provide in the United Kingdom, in each case through upholding standards of competence and conduct. As another example, activities associated with raising capital, offering investment funds and investment sales are regulated in the United States by the SEC and in other countries by similar securities regulatory authorities. The real estate investment trust managed\nby LaSalle that we launched during 2012 under the name of Jones Lang LaSalle Income Property Trust, Inc. increased our exposure to these types of regulations.\nAs a publicly traded company, we are subject to various corporate governance and other requirements established by statute, pursuant to SEC regulations and under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. During the past decade, the Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank legislative initiatives in the United States have added some significant requirements to various aspects of our governance. Additionally, changes in legal and regulatory requirements can impact our ability to engage in business in certain jurisdictions or increase the cost of doing so. The legal requirements of U.S. statutes may also conflict with local legal requirements in a particular country, as, for example, when anonymous hotlines required under U.S. law were construed to conflict in part with French privacy laws. The jurisdictional reach of laws may be unclear as well, as when laws in one country purport to regulate the behavior of affiliated corporations within our group that are operating in other countries. There is some uncertainty, for example, in the jurisdictional reach of the U.K. Bribery Act, and the standards for illegal activity in that Act are in some ways higher than those established under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nIdentifying the regulations with which we must comply, and then complying with them is complex. We may not be successful in complying with regulations in all situations, as a result of which we could be subject to regulatory actions and fines for non-compliance. The global economic crisis has resulted in an unusual level of related government and legislative activities, including for example the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which we expect will continue into the future and which exacerbates these risks. We are also seeing increasing levels of labor regulation in emerging markets, such as China, which affect our property management business.\nThe Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 added Section 13(r) of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\"Section 13(r)\"). Section 13(r) requires disclosure where we or any of our affiliates have knowingly engaged, among other things, in certain transactions involving Iran, the Government of Iran, or persons or entities designated under certain executive orders. We must also file a notice with the SEC if any disclosable activities under Section 13(r) have been included in an annual or quarterly report. Section 13(r) applies to all annual and quarterly reports required to be made after February 6, 2013, and applies to all contracts, including those in existence on or before that date.\nU.S. laws and regulations govern the provision of products and services to, and other trade-related activities involving, certain targeted countries and parties. These measures include U.S. economic sanctions targeting Iran, to which the Company is subject. As a result, we have had longstanding policies and procedures to restrict or prohibit sales of our services into countries that are subject to embargoes and sanctions or to countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism, such as Iran. In conjunction with such policies, we have also implemented certain procedures to evaluate whether existing or potential clients appear on the \"Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List\" (\"SDN List\") maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\").\nIn 2013, a U.K. subsidiary of the Company received payment for providing U.K. local property rating valuation services for a London property owned by the National Iranian Oil Company (\"NIOC\") and certain of its affiliates, which appear on OFAC's SDN List. The Company's compliance personnel identified this activity. Since learning of this activity, our senior management terminated the provision of any services to NIOC, and the Company does not otherwise intend to continue the services to NIOC or to otherwise engage in Iran-related activity contrary to applicable rules and regulations. The gross revenue and net profits attributable to these activities were approximately \u00a33,500 and \u00a31,153, respectively. Such sales involving NIOC are insignificant to our overall business and were inadvertently made in violation of our own internal corporate policies. The Company submitted a report of voluntary disclosure to OFAC regarding these transactions.\nChanges in governments or majority political parties may result in significant changes in enforcement priorities with respect to employment, health and safety, tax, securities disclosure and other regulations, which in turn could negatively affect our business.\nLICENSING AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.\nThe brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions, property management, construction, mobile engineering, conducting valuations, trading in securities for clients and the operation of the investment advisory business, among other business lines, requires us to maintain licenses in various jurisdictions in which we operate and to comply with particular regulations. We believe that licensing requirements have generally been increasing in recent years. If we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct regulated activities without a license or in contravention of applicable regulations, we may be required to pay fines or return commissions. We may also have a given license suspended or revoked, meaning that we would need to suspend or cease the business activities for which the license was required. Our acquisition activity increases these risks because we must successfully transfer licenses of the acquired entities and their staff, as appropriate. Licensing requirements may also preclude\nus from engaging in certain types of transactions or change the way in which we conduct business or the cost of doing so. In addition, because the size and scope of real estate sales transactions and the number of countries in which we operate or invest have increased significantly during the past several years, both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with the numerous licensing regimes and the possible loss resulting from noncompliance have increased. To the extent we expand our service offerings further into more heavily regulated sectors, such as healthcare, environmental, pharmaceutical, scientific and medical laboratories, airports and industrial, the regulatory framework within which we operate may get more complicated and the consequences of noncompliance more serious.\nThe regulatory environment facing the investment management industry has also grown significantly more complex in recent years. Countries are expanding the criteria requiring registration of investment advisors, whether based in their country or not, and expanding the rules applicable to those that are registered, all in an effort to provide more protection to investors located within their countries. In some cases, rules from different countries are applicable to more than one of our investment advisory companies and can conflict with those of their home countries. Although we believe we have good processes, policies and controls in place to address the new requirements, these additional registrations and increasingly complex rules increase the possibility that violations may occur.\nThese risks also apply separately to the real estate investment trust we launched during 2012 that is managed by LaSalle. That entity has registered the securities it is issuing with the SEC in the United States and is subject to regulation as a public company albeit not one separately listed on a stock exchange.\nHighly publicized accounting and investment management frauds that occurred in various businesses and countries during the financial crisis may result in significant changes in regulations that may affect our investment management business and our broker-dealer entities. Furthermore, the laws and regulations applicable to our business, both in the United States and in foreign countries, also may change in ways that materially increase the costs of compliance. Particularly in emerging markets, there can be relatively less transparency around the standards and conditions under which licenses are granted, maintained or renewed. It also may be difficult to defend against the arbitrary revocation of a license in a jurisdiction where the rule of law is less well developed.\nAs a licensed real estate service provider and advisor in various jurisdictions, we and our licensed employees may be subject to various due diligence, disclosure, standard-of-care, anti-money laundering and other obligations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us to litigation from parties who purchased, sold or leased properties we brokered or managed or who invested in our funds. We could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales or other services claiming that we did not fulfill our obligations as a service provider or broker. This may include claims with respect to conflicts of interest where we are acting, or are perceived to be acting, for two or more clients with potentially contrary interests.\nCOMPUTER AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS; MANAGEMENT OF DATA.\nOur business is highly dependent on our ability to process transactions, gather and disseminate information and manage various types of client and other data across numerous and diverse markets in many currencies. If any of our financial, accounting, human resources or other data processing, e-mail, client accounting, funds processing or electronic information management systems do not operate properly or are disabled, we could suffer a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, loss of client data, loss of employee data, regulatory intervention, breach of confidentiality or other contract provisions, or reputational damage. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including disruptions of electrical or communications services, disruptions caused by natural disasters, political instability, terrorist attacks, sabotage, computer viruses or problems with the Internet, deliberate attempts to disrupt our computer systems through \"hacking\" or other forms of cyber-attack, or our inability to occupy one or more of our office buildings. As we outsource significant portions of our information technology functions to third-party providers, we bear the risk of having somewhat less direct control over the manner and quality of performance than we would if done by our own employees. An example of this is the increasing use of \"cloud\" computing whereby we outsource to third parties the maintenance of increasing amounts of our business records, including electronically maintained documents and emails, rather than keeping them on our own servers.\nWe are exposed to the risk of cyber-attacks in the normal course of business. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. We have observed an increased level of attention focused on cyber-attacks that include gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. During 2013 and 2014, some major corporations reported that they had experienced broad-based theft of customer and internal data, with material financial and reputational consequences. We are also increasingly recognizing both the challenges and opportunities involved in mining the data in our systems so that we \"know\nwhat we know\" and can use that knowledge for the benefit of our clients and our organization in the most sophisticated possible ways.\nCyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as by causing denial-of-service attacks on websites. Cyber-attacks may be carried out by third parties or insiders using techniques that range from highly sophisticated efforts to electronically circumvent network security or overwhelm websites to more traditional intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information necessary to gain access. The objectives of cyber-attacks vary widely and can include theft of financial assets, intellectual property, or other sensitive information. Cyber-attacks may also be directed at disrupting our operations.\nTo the extent that our technology systems interact with those of our clients, they may face similar potential problems and losses as the result of cyber-attacks through our systems that then impact their systems. Certain of the high-profile cyber-attacks at other companies have come through the systems of suppliers.\nWhile we have not incurred any material losses related to cyber-attacks, nor are we aware of any specific or threatened cyber-incidents as of the date of this report, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences if we fall victim to one or more successful cyber-attacks. Such negative consequences could include remediation costs that may include liability for stolen assets or information and repairing system damage that may have been caused; increased cyber-security protection costs that may include organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third-party experts and consultants; lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract clients following an attack; litigation; and reputational damage adversely affecting client or investor confidence.\nThe development of new software systems used to operate one or more aspects of our business, particularly on a customized basis or in order to coordinate or consolidate financial, human resources or other types of infrastructure data reporting, client accounting or funds processing is complicated. Additionally, the effort may result in costs that we cannot recoup in the event of the failure to complete a planned software development. A new software system that has defects may cause reputational issues and client or employee dissatisfaction and/or damages, with our incurring liabilities and/or experiencing lost business as possible results. The acquisition or development of software systems is often dependent to one degree or another on the quality, ability and/or financial stability of one or more third-party vendors, over which we may not have control beyond the rights we negotiate in our contracts. Different privacy regulations from one country to the next (or across a region such as the European Union) may restrict our ability to share or collect data on a global basis, and this may limit the utility of otherwise available technology.\nThe Firm has implemented significant new financial, human resources, client relationship management, payables processing, securities management and trading and intranet software systems on a worldwide basis, and is in the process of transitioning various significant processes to these new systems. This implementation is complex and involves continuously evolving processes. If the Firm does not implement these new systems effectively, or if any of the new systems do not operate as intended, the effectiveness of the Firm's financial reporting or internal controls could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is also dependent, in part, on our ability to deliver to our clients the efficiencies and convenience that technology affords. The effort to gain technological expertise and develop or acquire new technologies requires us to incur significant expenses. If we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors do, we could lose market share. We are increasingly dependent on the Internet and on intranet technology to gather and disseminate critical business information publicly and also to our employees internally. In the event of technology failure, including a failure of outsourced \"cloud\" computing, or our inability to maintain robust platforms, we risk competitive disadvantage.\nThe proliferation of social media and different types of mobile hardware devices have increased the technology risks that all companies face, including as the result of the failure of staff to understand how to use them appropriately, which can result in the inadvertent disclosure of confidential information and the possible contract breaches and reputational damage that can result. A significant aspect of our protection against hacking relies on our people managing their passwords carefully and not inadvertently assisting in \"phishing\" attempts designed to provide access to our systems, and our efforts to train our people and provide appropriate encryption and other protections of mobile devices may not be sufficient to prevent unauthorized access.\nRISKS INHERENT IN MAKING ACQUISITIONS AND ENTERING INTO JOINT VENTURES.\nSince 2005, we have completed over 60 acquisitions as part of our global growth strategy. In July 2008, we acquired Staubach Holdings Inc., a U.S. real estate services firm specializing in tenant representation. In 2011, we completed eight acquisitions including the acquisition of United Kingdom-based international property consultancy King Sturge. In addition to King Sturge,\nwe completed acquisitions within the United States, South Africa, Australia, Singapore and Indonesia. During the period from the beginning of 2012 through the end of 2014, collectively, we completed 19 acquisitions, in the United States, Australia, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, England, France, Sweden, Spain and Portugal. As long as a reasonable level of confidence remains within the markets, we believe that additional acquisition opportunities will emerge from time to time and that our industry will continue to consolidate.\nAcquisitions subject us to a number of significant risks, any of which may prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits or synergies of the acquisition. The integration of companies is a complex and time-consuming process that could significantly disrupt the businesses of JLL and the acquired company. The challenges involved in integration and realizing the benefits of an acquisition include:\n\u2022\nDiversion of management attention and financial resources from existing operations;\n\u2022\nDifficulties in integrating cultures, compensation structures, operations, existing contracts, accounting processes and methodologies, technology and realizing the anticipated synergies of the combined businesses;\n\u2022\nFailure to identify potential liabilities during the due diligence process;\n\u2022\nFailure to identify improper accounting practices during the due diligence process;\n\u2022\nInability to retain the management, key personnel and other employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nInability to retain clients of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nExposure to legal, environmental, employment, professional standards, bribery, money-laundering, ethics and other types of claims for improper activities of the acquired business prior to acquisition, including those that may not have been adequately identified during the pre-acquisition due diligence investigation or those which the legal documentation associated with the transaction did not successfully terminate or transfer;\n\u2022\nAddition of business lines in which we have not previously engaged (for example, general contractor services for \"ground-up\" construction development projects); and\n\u2022\nPotential impairment of intangible assets, which could adversely affect our reported results.\nOur failure to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating our operations with those of another company or otherwise to realize any of the anticipated benefits of an acquisition could have a material adverse effect. Liabilities that we may either knowingly or inadvertently assume may not be fully insured. Additionally, the price we pay or other resources that we devote may exceed the value we realize, or the value we could have realized if we had allocated the consideration payable for the acquisition or other resources to another opportunity.\nTo a much lesser degree, but nevertheless occasionally, we have entered into joint ventures in order to conduct certain businesses or enter new geographies, and we will consider doing so in appropriate situations in the future. Joint ventures have many of the same risk characteristics as we discuss above with respect to acquisitions, particularly with respect to the due diligence and on-going relationship with the joint venture partner(s) given that each partner has inherently less control in a joint venture and will be subject to the authority and economics of the particular structure that is negotiated. Given a particular structure, we may not have the authority to direct the management and policies of the joint venture. If a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest, it could harm our brand, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND REGULATIONS; CLIMATE CHANGE RISKS; AND AIR QUALITY RISKS.\nThe Firm's operations are affected by federal, state and/or local environmental laws in the countries in which we maintain office space for our own operations and where we manage properties for clients. We may face liability with respect to environmental issues occurring at properties that we manage or occupy, or in which we invest. Various laws and regulations restrict the levels of certain substances that may be discharged into the environment by properties or they may impose liability on current or previous real estate owners or operators for the cost of investigating, cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at the property. We may face costs or liabilities under these laws as a result of our role as an on-site property manager or a manager of construction projects. Our risks for such liabilities may increase as we expand our services to include more industrial and/or manufacturing facilities than has been the case in the past. In addition, we may face liability if such laws are applied to expand our limited liability with respect to our co-investments in real estate as discussed above. Within our own operations, we face additional costs from rising fuel prices which make it more expensive to power our corporate offices.\nGiven that the Firm's own operations are generally conducted within leased office building space, we do not currently anticipate that regulations restricting the emissions of greenhouse gases, or taxes that may be imposed on their release would result in material costs or capital expenditures. However, we cannot be certain about the extent to which such regulations will develop as there are higher levels of understanding and commitments by different governments around the world regarding the\nrisks of climate change and how they should be mitigated. Regulations relating to climate change may affect the scope of services we provide to clients in their managed properties, but clients would typically bear any additional costs of doing so under their contracts with us. In any event, we anticipate that the burden and cost to the Firm of climate change disclosure and carbon reporting will increase over time.\nWe anticipate that the potential effects of climate change will increasingly impact the decisions and analysis that LaSalle makes with respect to the properties it considers for acquisition on behalf of clients since climate change considerations can impact the relative desirability of locations and the cost of operating and insuring acquired properties. Future legislation that requires specific performance levels for building operations could make non-compliant buildings obsolete, which could materially affect investments in properties we have made on behalf of clients, including those in which we may have co-invested. Climate change considerations will likely also increasingly be part of the consulting work that JLL does for clients to the extent it is relevant to the decisions our clients are seeking to make.\nWe are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us, and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location. However, these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties, which may adversely affect both us and the commercial real estate services industry in general. Environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management business, which could adversely affect the results of operations of this business segment.\nWe also anticipate that the potential effects of climate change will increasingly impact our own operations and those of client properties we manage, especially when they are located in coastal cities. For example, during 2012 our own operations and properties we manage for clients in the northeastern United States and in particular New York City, were impacted by Hurricane Sandy, in some cases significantly.\nDeclining air quality in major cities, Beijing being an example, may have consequences for our business in various ways, including the need to respond to new regulations that affect the management of buildings, declines in the desire of investors or corporates to invest in or occupy properties in such cities, and our ability to retain staff in locations that may be relatively undesirable as a place to live.\nABILITY TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY INTERNAL FINANCIAL REPORTING CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nIf we are not able to continue to successfully operate under the requirements of Section 404 of the United States Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or if there is a failure of one or more controls over financial reporting due to fraud, improper execution or the failure of such controls to adjust adequately as our business evolves, then our reputation, financial results and the market price of our stock could suffer. Our accounting can be complex and requires that management make judgments with respect to revenue recognition, acquisitions and other aspects of our business. While we believe that we have adequate internal financial reporting control procedures in place, we may be exposed to potential risks from this legislation, which requires companies to evaluate their internal controls and have their controls attested to by their independent registered public accounting firm on an annual basis. We have evaluated our internal control systems in order to allow our management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, our internal controls over financial reporting as required for purposes of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. However, there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive a positive attestation in future years, particularly since standards continue to evolve and are not necessarily being applied consistently from one independent registered public accounting firm to another. If we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls in the future that we cannot remediate in a timely fashion, we may be unable to receive a positive attestation at some time in the future from our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our internal controls over financial reporting.\nABILITY TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.\nOur business depends, in part, on our ability to identify and protect proprietary information and other intellectual property such as our service marks, domain names, client lists and information, and business methods. Existing laws of some countries in which we provide or intend to provide services, or the extent to which their laws are actually enforced, may offer only limited protections of our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements, and on patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. In particular, we hold various trademarks and trade names, including our principal trade name, \"JLL.\" If our registered trade name were to expire or terminate, our competitive position in certain markets may be materially and adversely affected. Our inability\nto detect unauthorized use (for example, by current or former employees) or take appropriate or timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe cannot be sure that the intellectual property that we may use in the course of operating our business or the services we offer to clients do not infringe on the rights of third parties, and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients. These claims may harm our reputation, cost us money and prevent us from offering some services.\nConfidential intellectual property is increasingly stored or carried on mobile devices, such as laptop computers, tablets and smartphones, which makes inadvertent disclosure more of a risk in the event the mobile devices are lost or stolen and the information has not been adequately safeguarded or encrypted. This also makes it easier for someone with access to our systems, or someone who gains unauthorized access by \"hacking\" or other type of cyber attack, to steal information and use it to the disadvantage of our Firm or our people. We believe that the risk from cyber attacks has increased significantly as some major companies during 2013 and 2014 reported that they had experienced broad-based theft of customer and internal data, with material financial and reputational consequences.\nAdvances in technology, which permit increasingly large amounts of information to be stored on smaller devices or on third party \"cloud\" servers, as well as the proliferation of social media techniques, tend to exacerbate these risks. On the other hand, cloud capabilities also allow us to do more monitoring of our email and other knowledge storing mechanisms in order to pro-actively detect misuse of our intellectual property, and we are in the process of implementing certain additional monitoring systems, as well as various data analytics designed to detect potential conflicts of interests and other inappropriate behaviors. While we believe these activities are beneficial from the perspective of protecting our assets, including clients' intellectual property to which we may have access, these activities carry certain risks related to compliance with privacy and other applicable regulations in certain countries.\nFinancial Risk Factors\nWE MAY HAVE INDEBTEDNESS WITH FIXED OR VARIABLE INTEREST RATES AND CERTAIN COVENANTS WITH WHICH WE MUST COMPLY.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had the ability to borrow, from a syndicate of lenders, up to $1.2 billion on an unsecured revolving credit facility. Borrowings under our Facility bear variable interest rates ranging from LIBOR plus 1.00% to 1.75% basis points. At December 31, 2014, we had outstanding letters of credit of $22.0 million under the Facility and no outstanding borrowings. Our average outstanding borrowings under the Facility were $357.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 at an effective interest rate of 1.2%. Subsequent to December 31, 2014, we amended and expanded the Facility; refer to Note 15, Subsequent Events, within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion. In addition to the Facility, we also have $275.0 million of unsecured long-term senior notes (the \"Notes\") that are due in 2022. The Notes bear an annual interest rate of 4.4%, subject to adjustment if a credit rating assigned to the Notes is downgraded below an investment grade rating (or subsequently upgraded).\nOur outstanding borrowings under the Facility fluctuate during the year primarily due to varying working capital requirements. For example, payment of annual incentive compensation represents a significant cash requirement commanding increased borrowings in the first half of the year, while historically the Firm's seasonal earnings pattern provides more cash flow in the second half of the year. To the extent we continue our acquisition activities in the future, the level of our indebtedness could increase materially if we use the Facility to fund such purchases.\nThe terms of the Facility, and to a lesser degree the Notes, contain a number of covenants that could restrict our flexibility to finance future operations or capital needs, or to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest. The debt covenants have the effect of limiting our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nEncumber or dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nIncur significant additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nMake significant investments;\n\u2022\nEngage in significant acquisitions.\nIn addition, the Facility requires that we comply with various financial covenants, including minimum leverage and cash interest coverage ratios.\nIf we are unable to make required payments under the Facility or required by the Notes, or if we breach any of the covenants, we will be in default, which could cause acceleration of repayment of outstanding amounts as well as defaults under other existing and future debt obligations.\nDOWNGRADES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS OR REDUCE OUR ACCESS TO FUNDING SOURCES IN THE CREDIT AND CAPITAL MARKETS.\nWe are currently assigned corporate credit ratings from Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard and Poor's Ratings Services based on their evaluation of our creditworthiness. All of our debt ratings remain investment grade, but there can be no assurance that we will not be downgraded or that any of our ratings will remain investment grade in the future. If our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, we could be required, among other things, to pay additional interest and fees on outstanding borrowings under the Facility. Credit rating reductions by one or more rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to funding sources, the cost and other terms of obtaining funding as well as our overall financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nVOLATILITY IN LASALLE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE FEE REVENUE.\nLaSalle's portfolio is of sufficient size to periodically generate large incentive fees and equity losses and gains that significantly influence our earnings and the changes in earnings from one year to the next. Volatility in this component of our earnings is inevitable due to the nature of this aspect of our business, and the amount of incentive fees or equity gains or losses we may recognize in future quarters is inherently unpredictable and relates to market dynamics in effect at the time. The speed with which the real estate markets worldwide turned from positive to negative starting in 2007 and continuing through 2009 is an example of the market volatility to which we are subject and over which we have no control. Further, as it relates to portfolio-specific results, the record magnitude of the combined incentive fees and equity earnings realized during the year ended December 31, 2014 is expected to moderate in future years. In the case of our commingled funds, underlying market conditions, particular decisions regarding the acquisition and disposition of fund assets, and the specifics of the client mandate will determine the timing and size of incentive fees from one fund to another. For separate accounts, where asset management is ongoing, we also may earn incentive fees at periodic agreed-upon measurement dates, and they may be related to performance relative to specified real-estate industry benchmarks and/or absolute return benchmarks.\nWhile LaSalle has focused over the past several years on developing more predictable annuity-type revenue, incentive fees should continue to be an important part of our revenue and earnings as long as real estate markets remain healthy. However, it is likely that the volatility described above will continue. For example, in 2006, we recognized one very significant incentive fee from the long-term performance of a separate account where we had ongoing portfolio management. This incentive fee was payable only once every four years and was calculated based on the account's performance relative to a market index. Given the extraordinary fall in asset prices that many markets experienced starting in 2007, our incentive fees fell significantly through 2010, and since then have rebounded. Any declines may be partially offset by our ability to take advantage of lower asset prices as we make new investments, although it is inherently difficult to predict with any confidence how all of these complicated factors will ultimately affect our future results.\nWhere incentive fees on a given transaction or portfolio are particularly large, certain clients have attempted to renegotiate fees even though contractually obligated to pay them, and we expect this to occur from time to time in the future. Our efforts to collect our fees in these situations may lead to significant legal fees and/or significant delays in collection due to extended negotiations, arbitration or litigation. They may also result in either negotiated reductions in fees that take into account the future value of the relationship or loss of the client.\nVOLATILITY IN HOTELS AND CAPITAL MARKETS FEES.\nWe have business lines other than LaSalle that also generate fees based on the timing, size and pricing of closed transactions and these fees may significantly contribute to our earnings and to changes in earnings from one quarter or year to the next. For example, in 2007 our Hotels business generated one very substantial fee from the sale of a large portfolio of hotels on behalf of a particular client. Volatility in this component of our earnings is inevitable due to the nature of these businesses and the amount of the fees we will recognize in future quarters is inherently unpredictable.\nLASALLE'S BANKING AND CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS.\nAlthough not highly leveraged by general industry standards, the investment funds that LaSalle operates in the ordinary course of business borrow money from a variety of institutional lenders. The loans typically are secured by liens on specific investment properties, but are otherwise non-recourse. During the global financial crisis, the values of specific properties were\nin some cases less than the amount of the outstanding loan on the property, which gave the lender the right to foreclose on the property, in which case the equity invested by the fund would be without value. These situations were typically addressed on a case-by-case basis and, because we generally maintain good relationships with our lenders, we were generally successful in renegotiations to retain the management of substantially all fund properties, which has given additional time for values to recover. A similar phenomenon could occur in connection with future economic recessions or liquidity contractions.\nSome clients of LaSalle that had open commitments to provide additional investments and that came under stress due to the financial downturn became less able financially to honor their commitments and sought to renegotiate the terms of their commitments or the fees that they pay. These activities did not result in materially adverse consequences to LaSalle or any of its funds. Clients adversely affected due to a future downturn may react similarly.\nWithin a difficult economic environment, raising new funds takes longer and may be less successful as current and prospective clients may be less able or willing to commit new funds to real estate investments, which are inherently less liquid than many competing investments. Additionally, certain clients may decide to manage all or a portion of their real estate investments with internal resources rather than hiring outside investment managers.\nCURRENCY RESTRICTIONS AND EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS.\nWe produce positive flows of cash in various countries and currencies that can be most effectively used to fund operations in other countries or to repay our indebtedness, which is currently primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We face restrictions in certain countries that limit or prevent the transfer of funds to other countries or the exchange of the local currency to other currencies. We also face risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates that may lead to a decline in the value of the funds produced in certain jurisdictions.\nAdditionally, although we operate globally, we report our results in U.S. dollars, and thus our reported results may be positively or negatively impacted by the strengthening or weakening of currencies against the U.S. dollar. As an example, the euro and the pound sterling, each a currency used in a significant portion of our operations, have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Our revenue from outside of the United States totaled 59% and 56% of our total revenue for 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition to the potential negative impact on reported earnings, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of the reported results of operations.\nWe are authorized to use currency-hedging instruments, including foreign currency forward contracts, purchased currency options and borrowings in foreign currency. There can be no assurance that such hedging will be economically effective. We do not use hedging instruments for speculative purposes.\nAs currency forward and option contracts are generally conducted off-exchange or over-the-counter (\"OTC\"), many of the safeguards accorded to participants on organized exchanges, such as the performance guarantee of an exchange clearing house, are generally unavailable in connection with OTC transactions. In addition, there can be no guarantee that the counterparty will fulfill its obligations under the contractual agreement, especially in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency of the counterparty, which would effectively leave us unhedged.\nIn 2009 and 2010, many of the most significant governments worldwide enacted economic stimulus measures of various types. In 2011 and 2012 some of these same governments, particularly within the European Union, have instituted austerity measures designed to reduce sovereign indebtedness. Additionally, certain questions have arisen about the viability of the euro and there has been speculation that some countries within the Eurozone may elect, or may be forced, to revert to the currency they issued prior to the establishment of the euro. Due to these variables and many other variables, it is inherently difficult to predict how and when these complicated factors will affect the relative values of currencies and in any event we anticipate significant continuing volatility in currency exchange rates.\nGREATER DIFFICULTY IN COLLECTING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES AND REGIONS.\nWe face challenges in our ability to efficiently and/or effectively collect accounts receivable in certain countries and regions. For example, various countries have underdeveloped insolvency laws, and clients often are slow to pay. In some countries, clients typically tend to delay payments, reflecting a different business culture over which we do not necessarily have any control. Less-developed countries may have very lengthy or difficult judicial processes that can make collections through the court system more problematic than they would otherwise be.\nAdditionally, weakness in the global economy can put additional financial stress on clients and landlords, who sometimes are the parties that pay our commissions where we have placed a tenant representation client into their buildings. This in turn can negatively impact our ability to collect our receivables fully or in a timely manner. We cannot be sure that the procedures we use to identify and rectify slowly paid receivables, and to protect ourselves against the insolvencies or bankruptcies of clients, landlords and other third parties with which we do business, which may involve placing liens on properties or litigating, will be effective in all cases.\nINCREASING FINANCIAL RISK OF COUNTERPARTIES, INCLUDING REFINANCING RISK.\nThe unprecedented disruptions and dynamic changes in the financial markets, and particularly insofar as they have led to major changes in the status and creditworthiness of some of the world's largest banks, investment banks and insurance companies, among others, have generally increased the counterparty risk to us from a financial standpoint, including with respect to:\n\u2022\nobtaining new credit commitments from lenders;\n\u2022\nrefinancing credit commitments or loans that have terminated or matured according to their terms, including funds sponsored by our investment management subsidiary which use leverage in the ordinary course of their investment activities;\n\u2022\nplacing insurance;\n\u2022\nengaging in hedging transactions; and\n\u2022\nmaintaining cash deposits or other investments, both our own and those we hold for the benefit of clients, which are generally much larger than the maximum amount of government-sponsored deposit insurance in effect for a particular account.\nWhile these risks remain higher than they have been historically, we believe they have moderated as the financial markets have stabilized in recent years. During 2012, we also diversified some of the counterparty risk under the Facility by issuing the Notes, the proceeds of which were initially used to reduce the outstanding loans under the Facility. We believe counterparty financial risks still remain elevated due mainly to the potential liquidity issues within certain European financial institutions.\nWe generally attempt to conduct business with only the highest quality and most well-known counterparties, but there can be no assurance (1) that our efforts to evaluate their creditworthiness will be effective in all cases (particularly as the quality of credit ratings provided by the nationally recognized rating agencies has been called into question), (2) that we will always be able to obtain the full benefit of the financial commitments made to us by lenders, insurance companies, hedging counterparties or other organizations with which we do business or (3) that we will always be able to refinance existing indebtedness (or commitments to provide indebtedness) which has matured by its terms, including funds sponsored by our investment management subsidiary.\nAdditionally, the ability of government regulatory authorities to adequately monitor and regulate banks, investment banks, securities firms and insurance companies was significantly called into question during the downturn (for example, in identifying and preventing \"pyramid schemes,\" \"bubbles\" in different asset classes and other potential systemic failures in a timely fashion), as the result of which the overall risk of unforeseeable financial loss from engaging in business with ostensibly regulated counterparties has increased.\nPOTENTIALLY ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES; CHANGES IN TAX LEGISLATION AND TAX RATES.\nWe face a variety of risks of increased future taxation on our earnings as a corporate taxpayer in the countries in which we have operations. Moving funds between countries can produce adverse tax consequences in the countries from which and to which funds are transferred, as well as in other countries, such as the United States, in which we are potentially subject to the taxation of earnings of other countries' operations. Additionally, as our operations are global, we face challenges in effectively gaining a tax benefit for costs incurred in one country that benefit our operations in other countries.\nChanges in tax legislation or tax rates may occur in one or more jurisdictions in which we operate that may materially increase the cost of operating our business. This includes the potential for significant legislative policy change in the taxation objectives with respect to the income of multinational corporations, as has recently been the subject of policy debate and proposals in many countries and in the current Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. It is also possible that some governments will make significant changes to their tax policies as part of their responses to their weakened economies.\nFurther, interpretations of existing tax law in various countries may change due to the activities of tax authorities, which we believe are generally increasing the level of examination activities of major corporations, and the decisions of courts. In\naddition, the views of the business community and the public on acceptable tax planning activities, expressed through increased media scrutiny and the activities of non-governmental activist organizations, may influence further changes in tax law, affecting corporate taxpayers broadly.\nWe face such risks both in our own business, but also in the investment funds that LaSalle operates. Adverse or unanticipated tax consequences to the funds can negatively impact fund performance, incentive fees and the value of co-investments that we have made. We are uncertain as to the ultimate results of these potential changes or what their effects will be on our business in particular.\nTHE CHARTER AND THE BYLAWS OF JONES LANG LASALLE, OR THE MARYLAND GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, COULD DELAY, DEFER OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL.\nThe charter and bylaws of Jones Lang LaSalle include provisions that may discourage, delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that may be in the best interest of Jones Lang LaSalle shareholders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe charter and bylaws provide for:\n\u2022\nThe ability of the Board of Directors to establish one or more classes and series of capital stock including the ability to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of such capital stock without any further shareholder approval;\n\u2022\nA requirement that any shareholder action taken without a meeting be pursuant to unanimous written consent; and\n\u2022\nCertain advance notice procedures for Jones Lang LaSalle shareholders nominating candidates for election to the Jones Lang LaSalle board of directors.\nUnder the Maryland General Corporation Law (the \"MGCL\"), certain \"Business Combinations\" (including a merger, consolidation, share exchange or, in certain circumstances, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities) between a Maryland corporation and any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation's shares or an affiliate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding voting stock of the corporation (an \"Interested Shareholder\") or an affiliate of the Interested Shareholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the Interested Shareholder became an Interested Shareholder. Thereafter, any such Business Combination must be recommended by the board of directors of such corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least (1) 80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares of the corporation and (2) 66 2/3% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares of the corporation other than shares held by the Interested Shareholder with whom the Business Combination is to be effected, unless, among other things, the corporation's shareholders receive a minimum price (as defined in the MGCL) for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the Interested Shareholder for its shares. Pursuant to the MGCL, these provisions also do not apply to Business Combinations approved or exempted by the board of directors of the corporation prior to the time that the Interested Shareholder becomes an Interested Shareholder.\nHuman Resources Risk Factors, Including From Non-Employees\nDIFFICULTIES AND COSTS OF STAFFING AND MANAGING INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.\nThe coordination and management of international operations pose additional costs and difficulties. We must manage operations that are in many time zones and that involve people with language and cultural differences. Our success depends on finding and retaining people capable of dealing with these challenges effectively, who will represent the Firm with the highest levels of integrity and who will communicate and cooperate well with colleagues and clients across multiple geographies. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, or to successfully plan for succession of employees holding key management positions, our growth may not be sustainable, and our business and operating results could suffer. These risks increase as we continue to grow as an organization and increase the number of staff, which has expanded significantly over the past decade.\nAmong the challenges we face in retaining our people is maintaining a compensation system that rewards them consistent with local market practices and with our profitability. This can be especially difficult where competitors may be attempting to gain market share by aggressively attempting to hire our best people at rates of compensation that are well above the current market level. Another continuing challenge we have is to maintain compensation systems that align financial incentives with our\nstrategic goals as an organization and the business and ethics behaviors we want to drive among our people, while at the same time not create incentives to engage in overly risky business pursuits or behaviors.\nWe have committed resources to effectively coordinate our business activities around the world to meet our clients' needs, whether they are local, regional or global. We also consistently attempt to enhance the establishment, organization and communication of corporate policies, particularly where we determine that the nature of our business poses the greatest risk of noncompliance. The failure of our people to carry out their responsibilities in accordance with our client contracts, our corporate and operating policies, or our standard operating procedures, or their negligence in doing so, could result in liability to clients or other third parties, which could have a material adverse effect. This is true not only with respect to individuals we employ directly, but also individuals who work for third party vendors whom we hire on behalf of clients, especially where we are acting in a principal capacity.\nWe believe these risks may be higher for our company than for others given that the nature of our business requires our people to be spread across numerous corporate offices and client facilities globally, which makes communications and consistency of standards more challenging. Additionally, the nature of our global outsourcing business means that we regularly must on-board significant numbers of new staff at one time as part of the transition into our Firm of new global accounts, which again makes communications of our policies and driving performance consistency particularly challenging.\nAn employee we hire may be subject to restrictions under employment agreements with previous employers that can restrict their activities, and therefore their contribution, for a period of time after they join us. For example, they may be prohibited from soliciting business from certain clients, or from soliciting other individuals to join us as employees.\nThe worldwide credit crisis and economic recession caused us to restructure certain parts of our business in 2009, and to a lesser degree during 2010, in order to size them properly relative to levels of business activity we expect in the markets in which we compete. These type of activities, which may recur in the future, present additional risks to the business. When addressing staffing in connection with a restructuring of our organization or a downturn in economic conditions or activity, we must take into account the employment laws of the countries in which actions are contemplated. In some cases, this can result in significant costs, time delays in implementing headcount reductions and, potentially, litigation regarding allegedly improper employment practices.\nNONCOMPLIANCE WITH POLICIES; COMMUNICATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT OF OUR POLICIES AND OUR CODE OF BUSINESS ETHICS.\nThe geographic and cultural diversity in our organization makes it more challenging to communicate the importance of adherence to our Code of Business Ethics and our Vendor Code of Conduct, to monitor and enforce compliance with its provisions on a worldwide basis, and to ensure local compliance with United States and English laws that apply globally in certain circumstances. These include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Patriot Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in the United States and the Bribery Act in the United Kingdom.\nBreaches of our Code of Business Ethics, particularly by our executive management, could have a material adverse effect. Breaches of our Vendor Code of Conduct by vendors whom we retain as a principal for client engagements can also lead to significant losses to clients from financial liabilities that might result.\nEMPLOYEE, VENDOR AND THIRD-PARTY MISCONDUCT.\nLike any business, we run the risk that employee fraud or other misconduct could occur. In a company such as ours with over 58,000 employees, it is not always possible to successfully deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee misconduct, including fraud and involvement in incoming or outgoing bribery situations, can cause significant financial or reputational harm to any business, from which full recovery cannot be assured. We also may not have insurance that covers any losses in full or that covers losses from particular criminal acts.\nBecause we often hire third-party vendors and suppliers to perform services for our own account or for clients, we are also subject to the consequences of fraud, bribery or misconduct by employees of our vendors, which also can result in significant financial or reputational harm (even if we have been adequately protected from a legal standpoint). We have instituted a Vendor Code of Conduct, which is published in multiple languages on our public Website, and which is intended to communicate to our vendors the standards of conduct we expect them to uphold. Our contracts with vendors also generally impose a contractual obligation to comply with that Code.\nAnecdotally, the risk that the Company will be the victim of fraud, both from employees and third parties, is generally thought to increase during times of broad economic stress such as we experienced particularly during 2008 and 2009. An example of a third-party fraud would be attempts to draw on bank accounts by way of forged checks or by corporate identity theft. We have increasingly experienced both types of attempts in recent years although none has caused us significant financial loss.\nSCRUTINY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS; AND INFLUENCE OF SHAREHOLDER ADVOCACY GROUPS.\nIn recent years, there has been increasing scrutiny of the executive compensation practices of all public companies in the United States. Shareholders have been given increasing rights to vote on the acceptability of pay practices and the issuance of equity compensation. Independent shareholder advocacy groups have also had increasing influence on the decisions of institutional investors on how to vote on executive compensation matters. In the event that these emerging circumstances result in changes to our pay practices or our ability to issue equity compensation to executives or otherwise to deduct executive compensation, we may have difficulty in retaining our executives or we could experience additional tax costs with respect to our compensation programs.", "PERMNO": 85246, "SIC": 6531, "TIC": "JLL"}
