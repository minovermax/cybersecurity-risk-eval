{"cik": "1084752", "company": "Inventergy Global, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business and Operations\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has issued a \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. We plan to continue to provide for our capital requirements by issuing additional equity and or debt. No assurance can be given that additional capital will be available when required or on terms acceptable to us. We also cannot give assurance that we will achieve sufficient revenues in the future to achieve profitability and cash flow positive operations. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time and there are no assurances that, if achieved, we will have sufficient funds to execute our business plan or to generate positive operating results. Our independent registered public accounting firm has indicated that these matters, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nOur management has determined that as of December 31, 2014, we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, because we did not have the appropriate internal personnel resources with the appropriate level of experience and technical expertise to provide oversight over the timely preparation and review of schedules necessary for the preparation of our financial statements and to make certain accounting judgments regarding accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP.\nWe are taking steps to remediate the material weakness described above; however, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in such remediation, or that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. If we fail to remediate the material weakness described above, or fail to maintain effective internal controls in the future, it could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial information or cause our stock price to decline. Our independent registered public accounting firm has not assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting so long as we are not an accelerated filer or larger accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected.\nThe Company\u2019s limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate its current business and future prospects and its inability to execute on its current business plan may adversely affect its results of operations and prospects.\nThe Company has generated minimal revenues to date. The Company not only has a very limited operating history, but also a limited track record in executing its business model which includes, among other things, acquiring, licensing, litigating or otherwise monetizing patent assets. The Company\u2019s limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate its current business model and future prospects.\nIn light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development with a limited operating history, there is a significant risk that the Company will not be able to:\n\u2022 implement or execute its current business plan, or demonstrate that its business plan is sound; and/or\n\u2022 raise sufficient funds in the capital markets to fund acquisitions of additional patent portfolios or the costs of litigation or otherwise to effectuate its long-term business plan.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to execute any one of the foregoing or similar matters may adversely affect its results of operations and prospects.\nThe Company has incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and has relied on external financing to support its operations. In the event the Company does not generate revenue from operations or obtain additional financing, its commercialization efforts will be delayed or curtailed.\nSince inception, the Company has incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations and has accumulated a deficit. The Company will need to generate revenue from operations or will require additional equity and/or debt financing to fund the Company\u2019s ongoing activities. There are no assurances that additional financing will be available to the Company at a cost acceptable to the Company, or at all.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we will need to raise additional funds, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. Moreover, additional financing may have an adverse effect on the value of the equity instruments held by the Company\u2019s stockholders.\nAssuming certain payables are deferred and expenses are managed efficiently, we believe our existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs to conduct our planned operations for less than three months. We will need significant additional capital to monetize our current patent portfolios and we will need significant additional capital to purchase any new patent portfolios. We believe our working capital expenses will be approximately $7.8 million for the next twelve months, which amount consists of approximately $3.7 million in employee related costs, $1.3 million in patent maintenance and prosecution fees, $1.8 million in other operational costs and $1 million of payments relating to the acquisition of our patent portfolios and additionally our debt servicing fees payable to Fortress Investment Group, LLC and its affiliates (\"Fortress\") will be approximately $0.5 million. In addition, we will be required to pay unconditional guaranteed payments to the sellers of our existing patent portfolios of an aggregate of $20 million ($18 million of which to be paid out of net revenues from patent licensing receipts) through 2017 (with a net present value of $16.9 million,). See Note 10 in the Notes to the Company Financial Statements for further information on these guaranteed payments.\nWe will seek to raise additional capital through, among other things, public and private equity offerings and debt financings (to the extent such financings are permissible pursuant to the Fortress Agreement), including through takedowns from our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 and the issuance of additional promissory notes to Fortress pursuant to the terms of the Fortress Agreement. We may also seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or other third parties. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our levels of net sales and licensing and the timing and extent of expenditures to support our patent infringement litigation, if any. Additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Furthermore, if we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we incur additional debt, it may increase our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization which could impact our business operations.\nIf adequate working capital is not available when needed, we may be required to significantly modify our business model and operations to reduce spending to a sustainable level. It could cause us to be unable to execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures. It may also cause us to reduce or cease operations altogether.\nWe may not be able to incur any additional indebtedness as a result of the Fortress Agreement. Our inability to incur additional indebtedness may prevent us from raising additional funds on acceptable terms or at all.\nThe Fortress Agreement limits our ability to raise additional indebtedness. Pursuant to the Fortress Agreement, we may only incur indebtedness (i) in respect to our obligations to Fortress, (ii) on unsecured trade payables that are not evidenced by a promissory note and are incurred in the ordinary course of business, (iii) if such indebtedness is unsecured and subordinated to the rights of the Fortress debt, and only then if Fortress provides its consent and (iv) if such indebtedness is secured by patent assets acquired after the Fortress transaction was consummated, and only then if such indebtedness is subordinated to the Fortress debt, Fortress provides its consent and Fortress is afforded a right of first refusal to issue the new debt. These limitations could substantially impact our ability to raise additional funds on acceptable terms or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds, it could cause us to be unable to execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures. It may also cause us to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs, reduce our operations, enable Fortress to foreclose on our patent assets or cause us to cease operations altogether.\nWe have incurred a material amount of indebtedness to fund our operations, the terms of which require that we pledge all of our assets as security and that we agree to share certain patent monetization revenues that may accrue in the future. Our level of indebtedness and the terms of such indebtedness, could adversely affect our operations and liquidity.\nWe have incurred debt secured by all of our assets under the terms of the Fortress Agreement and related transaction documents. Our obligations under the Fortress Agreement are secured by a first priority security interest in all of the Company\u2019s currently owned patent assets and all proceeds thereof, as well as a general security interest in all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries (though not in any future patent purchases by the Company). Additionally, the Fortress Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and indemnification provisions, as well as affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or guarantees, incur liens, sell our patent assets or permit a change in control of our Company.\nThe Fortress Agreement and the notes issued pursuant thereto (the \u201cFortress Notes\u201d) also include customary event of default provisions and if we were to default under the Fortress Agreement and were unable to obtain a waiver for such a default, interest on the obligations would accrue at an increased rate. In the case of a default, Fortress could accelerate our obligations under the Fortress Agreement and exercise their right to foreclose on their security interests, which could force us to cease operations.\nIncurrence and maintenance of this debt has material consequences on the Company, such as:\n\u00b7 requiring us to dedicate a material portion of our cash flow from operations and other capital resources to debt service, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other cash requirements;\n\u00b7 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in, our business and industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to incur additional debt on acceptable terms, if at all; and\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to dispose of patent assets to generate revenue.\nThe Fortress Agreement further provides, among other things, that an affiliate of Fortress is entitled to share in certain monetization revenues that we may derive in the future related to our current patent portfolios even after our indebtedness to Fortress is paid in full. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing revenues, and we may expend resources in pursuit of monetization revenues that may not result in any benefit to us. Moreover, the revenue sharing obligation will reduce the benefit we receive from any monetization transactions, which will adversely affect our operating results.\nThe Company may not be able to successfully monetize the patents it has acquired from Huawei, Nokia or Panasonic or which it may hereafter acquire and thus the Company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any such acquisition which would have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully monetize the patent portfolios that it acquires. The patents the Company acquires could fail to produce anticipated benefits, or could have other adverse effects that the Company currently does not foresee. Failure to successfully monetize these patent assets would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the acquisition of patent portfolios is subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7 There is a significant time lag between acquiring a patent portfolio and recognizing revenue from those patent assets, if at all. During that time lag, material costs (such as patent prosecution, maintenance, legal, financial and technical reviews, and potential reverse engineering) are likely to be incurred that would have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial position, lagging any potential revenues generated by such activity.\n\u00b7 The out-licensing of a patent portfolio is a time consuming and expensive process. If the Company\u2019s efforts are not successful, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be harmed. In addition, the Company may not achieve anticipated licensing results or other benefits from such acquisitions.\n\u00b7 If the Company initiates a patent infringement suit against potential infringers or potential licensees initiate a declaratory judgment action or administrative review action against the Company, such potential infringers and/or licensees may successfully invalidate the Company\u2019s patents or a fact finder may find that the potential infringer\u2019s products do not infringe the Company\u2019s patents. Thus, the Company may not successfully monetize the patents. These activities are inherently risky, time consuming and costly.\nThe Company has, to date, entered into only one licensing arrangement. Accordingly, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to monetize its patent portfolios and recoup its full investment.\nNew legislation, regulations or court rulings related to enforcing patents could harm the Company\u2019s business and operating results.\nIf Congress, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the \u201cUSPTO\u201d) or courts implement new legislation, regulations or rulings that impact the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, these changes could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business model. For example, limitations on the ability to bring patent enforcement claims, limitations on potential liability for patent infringement, lower evidentiary standards for invalidating patents, increases in the cost to resolve patent disputes and other similar developments could negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to license or assert the Company\u2019s patent or other intellectual property rights.\nIn addition, on September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the \u201cAIA\u201d) was signed into law. The AIA includes a number of significant changes to the United States patent law. These changes include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. As the regulations and procedures to govern administration of the AIA, especially the contested cases provisions (Inter-Partes Review (\u201cIPR\u201d) and Post-Grant Review (\u201cPGR\u201d) were only recently fully effective, it is too early to tell what, if any, impact the AIA will have on the operation of the Company\u2019s business. However, the AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of patents acquired by the Company, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition.\nThe United States government has placed restrictions on NASA, the National Science Foundation and the Commerce and Justice departments from buying information technology (in particular from Huawei) that has been \u201cproduced, manufactured or assembled\u201d by companies with ties to the Chinese government unless the FBI or a similar agency first determines the purchase would be in the national interest. We believe these restrictions impose no limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to license or enforce the patent assets that the Company has currently purchased or may purchase in the future from Huawei. Because we understand these restrictions apply solely to purchases of actual hardware and equipment, we believe the patent assets and rights which the Company has purchased from Huawei, with respect to those restrictions, include valid rights within the geographical United States which remain enforceable against all potential infringers. However, the United States government may try to apply other restrictions to prohibit its departments from licensing Huawei-related intellectual property rights, in which case we may be unable to consensually license patent assets purchased from Huawei to the U.S. government. Such interpretation of the prohibition, and other changes in United States law, regulation or practice as it relates to the license or enforcement of patent assets acquired from Huawei, could result in a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition.\nNew legislation has been introduced into the House of Representatives and the Senate, seeking to curb so-called \u201cLitigation Abuses\u201d. These bills include potential provisions for, among other things, expanded pleading requirements for patent litigations, patent-specific discovery and case management rules, disclosure obligations for parties having a financial interest in a patent case, certain provisions regarding so-called \u201ccustomer suits\u201d in favor of manufacturers. These bills have not yet been voted upon or amended and it is uncertain what, if any, new legislation will issue from the United States Congress, and what if any impact such legislation would have on the Company\u2019s business and operations.\nFurthermore, in various pending litigation and appeals in the United States Federal courts, various arguments and legal theories are being advanced to potentially limit the scope of damages that a patent licensing company such as us might be entitled to. Any one of these pending cases could result in new legal doctrines.\nIn September 2013, the Federal Trade Commission announced that it is planning to gather information from approximately 25 companies that are in the business of buying and asserting patents in order to develop a better understanding of how those companies do business and impact innovation and competition. Both the Federal Trade Commission and European Commission are actively considering what the appropriate restrictions are on the ability of owners of patents declared to technical standards to receive both injunctions and royalties.\nIn addition, the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) has conducted reviews of the patent system to evaluate the impact of patent assertion entities on industries in which those patents relate. It is possible that the findings and recommendations of the DOJ could impact the ability to effectively license and enforce standards-essential patents and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of any such patented technologies.\nFurther, the leadership changes in the European Commission (\u201cEC\u201d) make it challenging to predict whether and how the EC will shift its focus from its prior stances regarding the enforcement of intellectual property rights and the relationship between such rights and European competition law.\nAdditionally, there are numerous initiatives being pursued in multiple countries including India and Brazil, regarding when and how intellectual property rights should be enforced as well as the relationship between enforcement and other laws, including relevant anti-trust or competition law. It is too early to state with any degree of certainty the impact that such initiatives may have on our business.\nAdditionally, the political and legal climate in China appears to have changed and may cause significant challenges for foreign companies that attempt to enforce their intellectual property rights against Chinese business whether such rights are enforced in China or elsewhere in the world. At this time, it is unclear what if any impact this change in climate will have on our business.\nFurther, and in general, it is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, or whether any of the proposals will become enacted as laws. Compliance with any new or existing laws or regulations could be difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which the Company conducts its business and negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrent litigation and contemplated regulatory developments may render the Company's business model less profitable and may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.\nThe Company negotiates with leading technology companies to invest in, aggregate and acquire or in-license portfolios of patents and other intellectual property. Recent regulatory developments, as well as other pending litigation that is continuing to establish new laws and rules for the licensing and/or assertion of patents, may make this business model more difficult to execute, more risky and/or less profitable. As noted, new draft legislation proposed in Congress, if passed, might place more significant hurdles to the enforcement of the Company\u2019s patent rights, allow defendants increased opportunities to challenge the Company\u2019s patents in court and in the USPTO, introduce potentially expanded fee shifting for prevailing parties in litigation, and increase the risks and costs of patent litigation for all parties, including the Company. These changes and risks could decrease the value of the Company\u2019s intellectual property portfolio, as well as increase the risk of unlicensed infringement of such portfolio.\nIn addition, in various pending litigation and appeals in the United States Federal courts, various arguments and legal theories are being advanced to potentially limit the scope of damages a patent licensing company such as the Company might be entitled to. While the Company rejects many of these arguments as improperly limiting the rights granted to legitimate patent holders under the Constitution and US patent laws, any one of these pending cases could result in new legal doctrines that could make the Company\u2019s patent portfolios less valuable or more costly to enforce.\nIn addition, competition authorities in various countries and regions, as well as judicial actions in the United States and abroad are examining the rights and obligations of holders of standards essential patents (SEPs), and in some cases imposing restrictions and further obligations on the licensing and enforcement of SEPs. These changes in law and/or regulation may make the Company\u2019s licensing programs more difficult, may render some or all SEP patents held by Company unenforceable, or impose other restrictions, costs, impediments or harm to the Company\u2019s patent portfolios.\nWe commenced legal proceedings against security and communications companies, and we expect such proceedings to be time-consuming and costly, which may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to operate our business.\nTo license or otherwise monetize the patent assets that we own, we commenced legal proceedings against two companies, pursuant to which we allege that such companies infringe on one or more of our patents. As with all litigation, there is a risk that we may be unable to achieve the results we desire from such litigation, failure from which would harm our business to a great degree. In addition, the defendants in these litigations may have more resources than we do, which could make our litigation efforts more difficult.\nWe anticipate that legal proceedings may continue for several years and may require significant expenditures for legal fees and other expenses. Disputes regarding the assertion of patents and other intellectual property rights are highly complex and technical. Once initiated, we may be forced to litigate against other parties in addition to the originally named defendants. Our adversaries may allege defenses and/or file counterclaims for, among other things, revocation of our patents or file collateral litigations or initiate investigations in the United States or elsewhere in an effort to avoid or limit liability and damages for patent infringement. If such actions are successful, they may preclude our ability to derive licensing revenue from the patents currently being asserted.\nAdditionally, we anticipate that our legal fees and other expenses will be material and will negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations and may result in our inability to continue our business unless we are able to raise significant new capital or are successful in licensing our patent portfolios. We estimate that our legal fees over the next twelve months will be significant for these enforcement actions. Expenses thereafter are dependent on the outcome of the status of the litigation. Our failure to monetize our patent assets would significantly harm our business.\nIt is difficult to predict the outcome of patent enforcement litigation at the trial level. It is often difficult for juries and trial judges to understand complex, patented technologies and, as a result, there is a higher rate of successful appeals in patent enforcement litigation than more standard business litigation. Such appeals are expensive and time consuming, resulting in increased costs and delayed revenue. Although we diligently pursue enforcement litigation, we cannot predict with significant reliability the decisions that may be made by juries and trial courts.\nFurther, should we be deemed the losing party in certain of our litigations, we may be liable for some or all of our opponents\u2019 legal fees.\nFederal courts are becoming more crowded and, as a result, patent enforcement litigation is taking longer.\nOur patent enforcement actions are almost exclusively prosecuted in federal court. Federal trial courts that hear our patent enforcement actions also hear criminal cases. Criminal cases always take priority over our actions. As a result, it is difficult to predict the length of time it will take to complete an enforcement action. Moreover, we believe there is a trend in increasing numbers of civil lawsuits and criminal proceedings before federal judges and, as a result, we believe that the risk of delays in our patent enforcement actions will have a greater effect on our business in the future unless this trend changes.\nAcquisitions of additional patent assets may be time consuming, complex and costly, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nAcquisitions of patent or other intellectual property assets are often time consuming, complex and costly to consummate. The Company may utilize many different transaction structures in its acquisitions and the terms of such acquisition agreements tend to be heavily negotiated. As a result, if the Company seeks out new acquisition opportunities, the Company expects to incur significant operating expenses and will likely be required to raise additional financing during the negotiations even if any particular acquisition is ultimately not consummated. Even if the Company is able to acquire particular patent assets, there is no guarantee that the Company will generate sufficient revenue related to those patent assets to offset the acquisition costs. While the Company will seek to conduct reasonable due diligence on the patent assets it is considering for acquisition, the Company may acquire patent assets from a seller who does not have proper title to those assets or the assets may prove invalid, or unenforceable in subsequent litigation. In those cases, the Company may be required to spend significant resources to defend the interests in its patent assets and, if the Company is not successful, the Company\u2019s acquisition may be rendered effectively in part, or wholly, unusable, in which case the Company could lose part or all of its investment in the assets. Moreover, the Company may pay more to acquire a patent portfolio than it generates in future revenues. In addition, the Company could make an error in its due diligence or fail to uncover an important fact before acquiring a patent portfolio, thereby acquiring patents that are invalid or unenforceable.\nThe Company may also identify patent or other intellectual property assets that cost more than it is prepared to spend with its own capital resources. The Company may incur significant costs to organize and negotiate a structured acquisition that does not ultimately result in an acquisition of any patent assets or, if consummated, proves to be unprofitable for us. These higher costs could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results, and if the Company incurs losses, the value of the Company\u2019s securities may decline.\nIn addition, the Company may acquire patents and technologies that are in the early stages of adoption in the telecommunications and information technology markets. Demand for some of these technologies may likely be untested and may be subject to fluctuation based upon the rate at which the Company\u2019s licensees will adopt the Company\u2019s patents and technologies in their products and services. As a result, there can be no assurance as to whether technologies the Company acquires or develops will have value that the Company can monetize.\nIn certain acquisitions of patent assets, the Company may seek to defer payment or finance a portion of the acquisition price. This approach may put us at a competitive disadvantage to other parties pursuing the same assets and could result in harm to the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company has limited capital and may seek to negotiate acquisitions of patent or other intellectual property assets where the Company can defer payments or finance a portion of the acquisition price from the seller. These types of debt financing or deferred payment arrangements may not be as attractive to sellers of patent assets as receiving the full purchase price for those assets in cash at the closing of the acquisition. As a result, the Company might not compete effectively against other companies in the market for acquiring patent assets, some of whom have greater cash resources than the Company has.\nIf our market capitalization falls below the aggregate dollar amount that we owe to Panasonic at any time prior to our full payment of Panasonic pursuant to that certain patent purchase agreement, Panasonic will have a right to repurchase the assets we acquired at the purchase price we paid.\nPursuant to the patent purchase agreement with Panasonic, Panasonic is owed additional payments for the patents we purchased. If our market capitalization falls below the aggregate dollar amount that we owe at that relevant point in time to Panasonic, at any time prior to full payment, they may exercise their limited right to repurchase the assets we acquired from them at a purchase price at least equal to the amount we paid to purchase the entire portfolio. If they repurchase their assets, our ability to enforce our patent rights will be adversely affected.\nAny failure to maintain or protect the Company\u2019s patent assets or other intellectual property rights could significantly impair the Company\u2019s return on investment from such assets and harm the Company\u2019s brand, business and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to operate its business and compete in the intellectual property market largely depends on the superiority and value of its patent assets and other intellectual property. To protect the Company\u2019s proprietary rights, the Company relies and will rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and confidentiality agreements with the Company\u2019s employees and third parties and other protective contractual provisions. No assurances can be given that any of the measures the Company undertakes to protect and maintain the Company\u2019s assets will have any measure of success.\nDespite the Company\u2019s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights, any of the following or similar occurrences may reduce the value of the Company\u2019s intellectual property:\n\u2022 applications for patents, trademarks and copyrights may not be granted and, if granted, may be challenged or invalidated;\n\u2022 issued trademarks, copyrights, or patents may not provide the Company with any commercially viable claims against potentially infringing parties;\n\u2022 the Company\u2019s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights may not be effective in preventing misappropriation of the Company\u2019s IP assets; or\n\u2022 the Company\u2019s efforts may not prevent the development and design by others of products or technologies similar to or competitive with, or superior to those covered by the Company\u2019s IP.\nMoreover, the Company may not be able to effectively protect its intellectual property rights in certain foreign countries from which potential licensees or infringers may operate. If the Company fails to maintain, defend or prosecute its patent assets properly, the value of those assets would be reduced or eliminated, and the Company\u2019s business would be harmed.\nFollowing its acquisition of IP, the Company needs to spend significant time and resources maintaining and defending such assets which could cause it to incur significant costs and divert management attention from its core business which could adversely affect its prospects.\nFollowing the acquisition of patent assets, the Company needs to spend significant time and resources to maintain the effectiveness of those assets by paying maintenance fees and making filings with the USPTO and non-US equivalent government bodies. The Company acquired patent assets, including patent applications, which require us to spend resources to prosecute the applications with the USPTO and non-US equivalent government bodies. Further, there is a material risk that patent related claims (such as, for example, infringement claims (and/or claims for indemnification resulting therefrom), unenforceability claims, or invalidity claims) will be asserted or prosecuted against us, and such assertions or prosecutions could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Regardless of whether any such claims are valid or can be successfully asserted, defending such claims could cause the Company to incur significant costs and could divert resources away from its core business activities which could adversely affect its prospects.\nThe Company seeks to process pending patent applications for acquired and related intellectual property which takes time and is costly. Moreover, the failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for such inventions would lead to the loss of the Company\u2019s investments in such activities.\nMembers of the Company\u2019s management team have experience as inventors. As such, part of the Company\u2019s business may include the internal development of pending patent applications or other acquired intellectual property that the Company will seek to monetize. However, this aspect of the Company\u2019s business would likely require significant capital and would take time to achieve. Such activities could also distract the Company\u2019s management team from its present business initiatives, which could have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. There is also the risk that the Company\u2019s initiatives in this regard would not yield any viable new intellectual property, which would lead to a loss of the Company\u2019s investments in time and resources in such activities.\nIn addition, even if the Company is able to internally develop new patents or further prosecute patentable subject matter already contained within existing acquired patent portfolio(s), in order for those patents to be viable and to compete effectively, the Company would need to develop and maintain, and they would heavily rely on, a proprietary position with respect to such inventions and intellectual property. However, there are significant risks associated with any such intellectual property the Company may develop, principally including the following:\n\u2022 patent applications the Company may process may not result in issued patents or may take longer than the Company expects to result in issued patents;\n\u2022 the Company may be subject to interference and/or derivation proceedings;\n\u2022 the Company may be subject to opposition (including post-grant review and ex parte and inter partes reexamination) proceedings in the U.S. or foreign countries;\n\u2022 any patents that are issued to it may not provide meaningful protection;\n\u2022 other companies may challenge patents issued to it;\n\u2022 other companies may have independently developed and/or patented (or may in the future independently develop and patent) similar or alternative technologies;\n\u2022 other companies may design around patents the Company has processed; and\n\u2022 enforcement of the Company\u2019s patents could be complex, uncertain and very expensive.\nThe Company cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any future or pending applications or that any of such patents, once issued, will provide the Company with adequate coverage for licensing operations. For example, issued patents may be circumvented or challenged, declared invalid or unenforceable, or narrowed in scope. In addition, since publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, the Company cannot be certain that the patent applications will be the first to have been filed covering those inventions. It is also possible that others may have or may obtain issued patents that could prevent the Company\u2019s potential licensees from commercializing their products or require them to obtain licenses requiring the payment of significant fees or royalties to others. This could make it more difficult for the Company to monetize its assets. As to those patents that the Company may license or otherwise monetize, the Company\u2019s rights will depend on maintaining the Company\u2019s obligations to the licensor under the applicable license agreement, and the Company may be unable to do so. The Company\u2019s failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights for the Company\u2019s inventions would lead to the loss of the Company\u2019s investments in such activities, which would have a material and adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nMoreover, patent application delays could cause delays in recognizing revenue from the Company\u2019s internally generated patents and could cause us to miss opportunities to license patents before other competing technologies are developed or introduced into the market.\nOur confidential information may be disclosed by other parties.\nWe routinely enter into non-disclosure agreements with other parties, including but not limited to vendors, law firms, parties with whom we are engaged in negotiations, and employees. However, there exists a risk that those other parties will not honor their contractual obligations to not disclose our confidential information. This may include parties who breach such obligations in the context of confidential settlement offers and/or negotiations. In addition, there exists a risk that, upon such breach and subsequent dissemination of our confidential information, third parties and potential licensees may seek to use such confidential information to their advantage and/or to our disadvantage including in legal proceedings in which we are involved. Our ability to act against such third parties may be limited, as we may not be in privity of contract with such third parties.\nWeak global economic conditions may cause infringing parties to delay entering into licensing agreements which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s business plan depends significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the economies of many countries are experiencing weak economic conditions. Uncertainty about global economic conditions poses a risk as businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and declines in income or asset values. This response could have a material negative effect on the willingness of parties infringing on the Company\u2019s assets to enter into licensing or other revenue generating agreements voluntarily. Entering into such agreements is critical to the Company\u2019s business plan, and the Company\u2019s inability to do so could cause material harm to the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends upon its ability to keep pace with the latest technological changes and the Company\u2019s failure to do so could make us less competitive which would adversely affect our prospects.\nThe markets addressed by the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights are characterized by rapid change and technological change, frequent new product innovations, changes in customer requirements and expectations and evolving industry standards. Products using new technologies or emerging industry standards could make the Company\u2019s patent portfolios less attractive or applicable. As a result, the Company\u2019s success will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to acquire, develop and out-license intellectual property in a timely manner with respect to the technological advances available to the Company\u2019s prospective out-licensees, evolving industry standards and changing preferences.\nIn the event that the Company must commence legal proceedings against patent infringers unwilling to license its acquired intellectual property, it expects such proceedings to be time-consuming and costly, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and its ability to operate its business.\nIn the event the Company is unable to successfully enter into out-licenses with infringing companies for patents the Company has acquired or in-licensed, the Company may have to bring a patent infringement action against such infringing companies. Such patent infringement litigation may continue for several years and may require significant expenditures for legal fees and other expenses. Disputes regarding the assertion of patents and other intellectual property rights are highly complex and technical. Once initiated, the Company may be forced to litigate against others to enforce or defend its intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. The defendants or other third parties involved in the lawsuits in which the Company may become involved may have substantially more resources than we do. Furthermore, such parties may allege defenses and/or file counterclaims in an effort to avoid or limit liability and damages for patent infringement. If such defenses or counterclaims are successful, they may preclude the Company\u2019s ability to derive licensing revenue from the patent portfolios. A negative outcome of any such litigation, or one or more claims contained within any such litigation, could materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s business. Additionally, the Company anticipates that its legal fees and other expenses will be material and will negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations and may result in its inability to continue its business plan. Expenses are also dependent on the outcome of such proceedings. The Company\u2019s failure to monetize its patent assets would significantly harm the Company\u2019s business and financial position.\nThe Company\u2019s future success depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued service of its key personnel and its ability to hire additional qualified personnel and its inability to attract, retain or hire personnel could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain its key personnel or that it can attract, assimilate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future. Additionally, the Company does not currently carry a key-man insurance policy. Although the Company has entered into letter agreements with its current officers, each of such employees serves as an \u201cat will\u201d employee whose employment is terminable in the discretion of the board of directors. In addition, the Company\u2019s anticipated growth will require it to recruit, hire and retain a number of new managerial, technical, operating and marketing personnel. The inability to retain, recruit and hire necessary personnel or the emergence of unexpected expansion difficulties could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain existing personnel or identify or hire additional personnel.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in a growing business enterprise and there is no assurance that it will be successful.\nThe likelihood of the Company\u2019s success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties and complications of an early stage company. The ability or inability of the Company to maintain current and potential clients, form new business relationships and partnerships, execute licensing programs, meet competition, and comply with applicable governmental regulations will also impact the growth and the profitability of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly revenue and operating results are expected to be unpredictable and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to factors outside the Company\u2019s control which could adversely affect its business and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of its control and which will make period to period comparisons difficult. Generally, the timing and success of the Company\u2019s licensing and litigation efforts will be unpredictable and intermittent rather than steady, and can be expected to continue to be unpredictable. The primary factors that may affect its revenues and operating results include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 the length and variability of the cycle for licensing the technology;\n\u00b7 the random timing of the outcome of any litigation we may commence and the unpredictability of the success of any litigation we may commence;\n\u00b7 the quality and degree of execution of our business strategy and operating plan, and the effectiveness of our sales and licensing programs; and\n\u00b7 timing of revenue recognition and the application of complex revenue recognition accounting rules to our licensing arrangements.\nIt can be difficult for the Company to predict the timing of licensing of its technology, and it is unable to control timing decisions made by potential licensees. As a result, the Company\u2019s quarterly operating results are difficult to predict even in the near term and a delay in an anticipated license past the end of a particular quarter may negatively impact its results of operations for that quarter, or in some cases, that year. Therefore, the Company believes that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of its operating results will be a poor indication of its future performance. If its revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any guidance the Company may provide to the market, the price of the common stock could decline substantially.\nIf revenues for a particular quarter are below expectations, the Company would likely be unable to reduce costs and expenses proportionally for that quarter. Any such revenue shortfall would, therefore, have a significant effect on its operating results for that quarter.\nRisks Related to the Telecommunications Industry\nIf the products or services that are marketed or sold by the Company\u2019s clients do not maintain market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to out-license the technologies that it acquires may be limited and its results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCertain segments of the telecommunications industry are dependent on developing and marketing new products and services that respond to technological and competitive developments and changing customer needs. The Company cannot assure you that the IP assets it acquires that may be used in current or future products and services will gain or obtain increased market acceptance. The development of new or enhanced technologies could result in a loss of actual or potential market share by businesses utilizing our IP assets which may limit our ability to monetize our IP assets.\nThe regulatory framework and future changes in regulatory requirements under which telecommunications companies operate could require substantial time and resources for compliance by the Company\u2019s licensees which could make it more difficult and costly for it to monetize its IP assets.\nIn providing certain interstate and international telecommunications services, telecommunications companies must comply, or cause its customers or carriers to comply, with applicable telecommunications laws and regulations prescribed by the FCC and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. In offering services on an intrastate basis, such companies may also be subject to state laws and to regulation by state public utility commissions. International services may also be subject to regulation by foreign authorities and, in some markets, multinational authorities, such as the European Union. The costs of compliance with these regulations, including legal, operational and administrative expenses, can be expected to be substantial, and efforts and costs spent by potential licensees for these efforts may impede licensing negotiations with the Company, and could make it more difficult and costly for us to monetize our IP assets.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile, leading to the possibility of its value being depressed at a time when our stockholders want to sell their holdings.\nThe market price of our common stock has in the past been, and may in the future continue to be, volatile. For instance, from June 6, 2014 through March 20, 2015, the closing price of our common stock has ranged between $3.85 and $0.446 per share. A variety of events may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including but not necessarily limited to:\n\u00b7 quarter to quarter variations in operating results;\n\u00b7 day traders;\n\u00b7 adverse or positive news reports or public announcements; and\n\u00b7 market conditions within our industry.\nIn addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of companies, at times for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock at a time when our stockholders want to sell their interest in us.\nIf we fail to meet the applicable continued listing requirements of Nasdaq Capital Market, Nasdaq may delist our common stock, in which case the liquidity and market price of our common stock could decline.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy certain continued listing requirements. If we are deficient in maintaining the necessary listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted. On December 31, 2014, we received a written notice from Nasdaq indicating that because the closing bid price for the Company\u2019s common stock has fallen below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, the Company no longer complies with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Rule 5550(a)(2) of Nasdaq Listing Rules. While Nasdaq\u2019s notice had no immediate effect on the listing of the Company\u2019s common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market (pursuant to Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided an initial compliance period of 180 calendar days, or until June 29, 2015, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement), if the Company does not regain compliance its common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq Capital Market.\nTo regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days prior to June 29, 2015. If the Company does not regain compliance by June 29, 2015, the Company may be eligible for an additional grace period. To qualify, the Company would be required to meet the continued listing requirements for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the minimum bid price requirement, and provide written notice of its intention to cure the minimum bid price deficiency during the second compliance period. If the Company meets these requirements, the Nasdaq staff will grant an additional 180 calendar days for the Company to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. If the Nasdaq staff determines that the Company will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if the Company is otherwise not eligible for such additional compliance period, Nasdaq will provide notice that the Company\u2019s common stock will be subject to delisting. The Company would have the right to appeal a determination to delist its common stock, and the common stock would remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market until the completion of the appeal process. However, there is no assurance that we will regain compliance with all of Nasdaq\u2019s initial listing requirements by such date. If we do not regain compliance by such date, our securities will likely cease trading on Nasdaq, which may adversely affect the liquidity and trading of our securities.\nIf Nasdaq delists our common stock from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange, we expect our securities could be quoted on the OTCQB or the \u201cpink sheets.\u201d If this were to occur, we could face material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u2022\nreduced liquidity for our securities;\n\u2022\na determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u2022\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u2022\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nOther than a special cash dividend that we declared with respect to our common stock on June 9, 2014 in connection with the Merger, we have not declared any cash dividend to date and we do not anticipate declaring any further cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. For the time being, we intend to retain future earnings for use in the development of our business.\nThe application of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules to our common stock could limit trading activity in the market, and our stockholders may find it more difficult to sell their stock.\nOur common stock is trading at less than $5.00 per share. If our common stock were to be delisted from Nasdaq for any reason, our common stock would become subject to the SEC\u2018s penny stock rules. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. Penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The broker-dealer must also make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit their market price and liquidity of our securities. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect your ability to resell our common stock.\nOur stockholders' percentage of ownership may become diluted upon conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock, and/or Series B Preferred Stock, upon the exercise of currently outstanding warrants and/or options, or if we issue new shares of stock or other securities, including issuances to consultants as compensation pursuant to our referral agreements, additionally, issuances of additional preferred stock or other securities by us may further subordinate the rights of the holders of our common stock.\nThe holders of our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock may convert their shares of preferred stock into shares of common stock at any time. Additionally, all of the Series B Preferred Stock will automatically convert into common stock upon the affirmative vote of holders owning at least 60% of the Series B Preferred Stock or immediately upon closing of an underwritten public offering of the Company in an amount not less than $20 million and at a threshold price determined in accordance with the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations. As of March 23, 2015, there are currently outstanding 541,066 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 1,102 shares of Series B Preferred Stock which may be converted into 1,731,684 shares of common stock at any time. In addition to our outstanding shares of preferred stock, there are currently outstanding warrants to purchase 1,691,637 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, and 2,893,918 outstanding options which may be exercised into an aggregate of 4,585,555 shares of common stock. A further 178,571 shares are available for grant pursuant to the Company equity incentive plan. In addition, the Company may enter into additional referral agreements with unaffiliated third parties for the provision of commercial and/or technical assistance to facilitate completion of designated acquisitions of assets and compensation under such agreements may be payable in in equity. Further, our board of directors is authorized, without stockholder approval, subject to certain Nasdaq requirements, to cause us to issue additional shares of our common stock or to raise capital through the issuance of additional preferred stock (including equity or debt securities convertible into preferred stock or our common stock, subject to limitations set forth in the Fortress Agreement and in our fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation), options, warrants and other rights, on such terms and for such consideration as our board of directors in its sole discretion may determine. Our board of directors is also authorized, without stockholder approval, to designate and issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock in addition to the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. The conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, the exercise of our outstanding warrants and options, the issuance of new securities or the creation of new series of preferred stock could result in significant dilution to existing stockholders. In addition, securities issued in connection with future financing activities or potential acquisitions may have rights and preferences senior to the rights and preferences of the common stock.\nBecause our directors and executive officers are among our largest shareholders, they can exert significant control over our business and affairs and have actual or potential interests that may depart from investors.\nAs of March 20, 2015, our directors and executive officers collectively and beneficially own 38.4% of outstanding common stock. Joseph Beyers, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, beneficially owns 21.7% of our outstanding common stock. Additionally, the holdings of our directors and executive officers may increase in the future upon vesting or other maturation of exercise rights under any of the options or warrants they may hold or in the future be granted or if they otherwise acquire additional shares of our common stock. The interests of such persons may differ from the interests of our other shareholders. As a result, in addition to their board seats and offices, such persons will have significant influence over and control all corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, irrespective of how our other shareholders may vote, including the following actions:\n\u00b7 to elect or defeat the election of our directors;\n\u00b7 to amend or prevent amendment of our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws;\n\u00b7 to effect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and\n\u00b7 to control the outcome of any other matter submitted to our shareholders for vote.\nSuch persons\u2019 stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.", "PERMNO": 87604, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "INVT"}
