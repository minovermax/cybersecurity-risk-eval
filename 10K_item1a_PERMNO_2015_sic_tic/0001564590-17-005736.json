These risks may negatively impact our existing business, future business opportunities, our financial condition or our financial results. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could also decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently see as immaterial, may also negatively impact our business.\nOur cash flow is dependent upon operating cash flow, available cash and available funds under our financing agreement with Chase.\nBecause we are dependent on our operating cash flow, any loss of a significant customer, any further decreases in the distribution of our skin and hair care or household products, new competitive products affecting sales levels of our products or any significant expense not included in our internal budget could result in the need to raise cash. Our agreement with Chase has a term that expires on June 30, 2019. We have no other arrangements for any external financing of debt or equity, and any such financing may not be available on acceptable terms. In order to improve our operating cash flow, we need to continue to increase our revenues and/or further reduce our costs.\nUnfavorable economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products.\nUnfavorable and uncertain economic conditions in the past have adversely affected, and in the future may adversely affect, consumer demand for some of our products, resulting in reduced sales volume. Factors that can affect consumer demand include rates of unemployment, consumer confidence, health care costs, fuel and other energy costs and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior.\nSales of our existing products are affected by changing consumer preferences.\nOur primary market is retail stores in the United States which sell to consumers or end users in the mass market. Consumer preferences can change rapidly and are affected by new competitive products. This situation is true for both skin and hair care and household products and has affected our products. For example, we believe that our Alpha\u00ae Skin Care products with AHAs are effective in helping to diminish fine lines and wrinkles, but consumers may change permanently or temporarily to other products using other technologies or otherwise viewed as \u201cnew.\u201d Any changes in consumer preferences can materially affect the sales and distribution of our products and thereby our revenues and results of operations.\nIn both skin and hair care and household products, our competitors include some of the largest consumer products companies in the United States.\nThe markets in which our products compete are intensely competitive, and many of the other competitors in these markets are multi-national consumer products companies that are significantly larger than us. These large competitors have financial, technical, and other resources exceeding those available to us, and as a result, are able to regularly introduce new products and spend considerably more than we can on advertising. The distribution and sales of our products can be adversely impacted by the actions of our competitors, and we may have little or no ability to take action to prevent or mitigate these adverse impacts.\nWe have limited resources to promote our products with effective advertising and marketing.\nWe believe the growth of our net sales is substantially dependent upon our ability to introduce our products to current and new consumers through advertising and marketing. At present, we have limited resources compared to many of our competitors to spend on advertising and marketing. Advertising and marketing can be important in reaching consumers, although the effectiveness of any particular advertisement and marketing cannot be predicted. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain optimal effectiveness at our current advertising and marketing budget even though we made a strategic decision to increase our advertising and marketing spending in 2016 and 2015 compared to the prior several years. Our limited resources to promote our products through advertising and marketing may adversely affect our net sales and operating performance.\nMaintaining or increasing our revenues is dependent, in part, on the introduction of new products that are successful in the marketplace.\nIf we are not successful in making ongoing sales of our newer products to retail stores or these products are not well received by consumers, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected.\nA loss of one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our product sales.\nFor more than a majority of our sales, we are dependent upon sales to a small number of major retail customers, including Ulta, which is our largest customer and Wal-Mart, which is our second largest customer. The easy access of consumers to our products is dependent upon these major retail stores and other retail stores carrying our products. The willingness of these customers (i.e., retail stores) to carry any of our products depends on various factors, including the level of sales of the product at their stores. Any declines in sales of a product to consumers can result in the loss of retail stores and a corresponding decrease in the distribution of the product. It is uncertain whether the consumer base served by these stores would purchase our products at other retail stores. In the past, sales of our products have been affected by retail stores which discontinue a product or carry the product in fewer stores.\nA significant part of our sales of skin and hair care products are represented by the Montagne Jeunesse sachet products and Batiste Dry Shampoo products, both of which depend upon the continuation of our distributorship agreements with the manufacturers of these products.\nIf our agreements with Montagne Jeunesse or Church & Dwight are terminated, we will no longer be able to distribute Montagne Jeunesse or Batiste Dry Shampoo products and sales in our skin and hair care segment would be adversely affected. Please see \u201cManufacturing and Suppliers\u201d in Item 1 for information on the terms of our agreements with Montagne Jeunesse and Church & Dwight.\nWe face the risk that raw materials for our products may not be available or that costs for these materials will increase, thereby affecting either our ability to manufacture the products or our gross margin on the products.\nWe obtain our raw materials from third party suppliers, three of which are sole source suppliers. We have no long term contracts with our suppliers, and, if a contract exists, it is subject to termination or cost increases. We may not have sufficient raw materials for production of products manufactured by us if there is a shortage in raw materials or one of our suppliers terminates our relationship. In addition, changing suppliers could involve delays that restrict our ability to manufacture or buy products in a timely manner to meet delivery requirements of our customers. Our suppliers of products which we distribute can also be subject to the same risk with their vendors.\nUntil we start to manufacture the products that we acquired in the Acquisition we face the risk that these products may not be available to us or that costs for these products will increase, thereby affecting either our ability to sell the products or our gross margin on the products.\nWe obtain the products that we acquired in the Acquisition from third party contract manufacturers. We have no long term contracts with these manufacturers. We may not have sufficient inventory of these products if there is a delay in receiving products from one of these third party contract manufacturers or one of them terminates our relationship.\nOur sales are affected adversely by returns.\nIn our industry, our customers may be given authorization by us to return products. These returns result in refunds, a reduction of our revenues and usually the need to dispose of the resulting inventory at discounted prices. Accordingly, the level of returns can significantly impact our revenues and cash flow. See information about returns in \u201cResults of Operations\u201d in Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nChanges in the regulation of our products, including environmental regulations, could have an adverse effect on the distribution, cost or function of our products.\nRegulations affecting our products include requirements of the FDA for cosmetic products and environmental regulations affecting emissions from our products. In the past, the FDA has mentioned the treatment of products with AHAs as drugs, which could make our production and sale of certain Alpha\u00ae Skin Care products more expensive or prohibitive. Also, in the past, we have been required to change the formulation of our household products to comply with environmental regulations and may be required to do so again in the future if the applicable regulations are further amended.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our future financial results and stock price.\nAny adverse developments in litigation could have a material impact on us.\nWe are subject to lawsuits from time to time in the ordinary course of business. While we expect those lawsuits not to have a material effect on us, an adverse development in any such lawsuit or the insurance coverage for a lawsuit could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and cash flow.\nAny loss of our key executives or other personnel could harm our business.\nOur success has depended on the experience and continued service of our executive officers and key employees. If we fail to retain these officers or key employees, our ability to continue our business and effectively compete may be substantially diminished. Because of our size, we must rely in many departments within our Company on one or two key employees. The loss of any one of these employees could slow our product development, production of a product and sale and distribution of a product.\nOur stock price can be volatile and can decline substantially.\nOur stock is traded on the OTC Bulletin Board. The volume of trades in our stock varies from day to day but is relatively limited. As a result, any events affecting us can result in volatile movements in the price of our stock and can result in significant declines in the market price of our stock.", "PERMNO": 69471, "SIC": 2844, "TIC": "SLGD"}
