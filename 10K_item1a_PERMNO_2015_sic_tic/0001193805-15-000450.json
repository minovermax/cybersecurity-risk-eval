RISK FACTORS\nThe purchase of our common stock involves a very high degree of risk.\nIn evaluating us and our business, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included herein. If any of the events described in the risks below actually occurs, our financial condition or operating results may be materially and adversely affected, the price of our common stock may decline, perhaps significantly, and you could lose all or a part of your investment.\nThe risks below can be characterized into three groups:\n1)\nRisks related to our business, including risks specific to the defense and aerospace industry:\n2)\nRisks arising from our indebtedness; and\n3)\nRisks related to our common stock and our status as a public company.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA reduction in government spending on defense could materially adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nApproximately 90% of our revenue is derived from products for US military aviation. There are risks associated with programs that are subject to appropriation by Congress, which could be potential targets for reductions in funding. The Department of Defense has announced plans to significantly reduce spending beginning in Fiscal 2014 and beyond. Reductions in United States Government spending on defense or future changes in the mix of defense products required by United States Government agencies could limit demand for our products, and may have a materially adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOn March 1, 2013, the US Government imposed across the board spending reductions commonly referred to as \u201cthe Sequester\u201d. These spending reductions included spending by the Department of Defense. During 2014, we experienced a reduction in sales at AIM and NTW that we believe is the result of a slowing of orders as a result of the Sequester and the resulting reduction or shift in the components of defense spending. We have also experienced slowdowns, albeit to a lesser degree, at WMI .\nWe depend on revenues from a few significant relationships, in particular with United Technology Corporation. Any loss, cancellation, reduction, or interruption in these relationships could harm our business.\nWe expect that our customer concentration will not change significantly in the near future. We derive most of our revenues from a small number of customers. Two customers represented 47.3% and three customers represented 56.0% of total sales for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The markets in which we sell our products are dominated by a relatively small number of customers which have contracts with United States governmental agencies, thereby limiting the number of potential customers. Our success depends on our ability to develop and manage relationships with significant customers. We cannot be sure that we will be able to retain our largest customers or that we will be able to attract additional customers, or that our customers will continue to buy our products in the same amounts as in prior years. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction or interruption in sales to these customers, our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers or future price concessions that we may have to make, could significantly harm our business.\nWe depend on revenues from components for a few aircraft platforms and the cancellation or reduction of either production or use of these aircraft platforms could harm our business.\nAIM derives most of its revenues from components for a few aircraft platforms, specifically the Sikorsky BlackHawk helicopter, the Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye naval aircraft and the McDonnell Douglas (Boeing) C-17 Globemaster. Boeing has announced that it will close its C-17 production line in 2015. NTW derives most of its revenues from the Falcon and the Hornet. These aircraft platforms constituted approximately 80% of the revenues of the operations of NTW during 2013 and 2014. A reduction in demand for our products as a result of either a reduction in the production of new aircraft or a reduction in the use of existing aircraft in the fleet (reducing after-market demand) would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIntense competition in our markets may lead to a reduction in our revenues and market share.\nThe defense and aerospace component manufacturing market is highly competitive and we expect that competition will increase and perhaps intensify as the overall market remains static or declines. Many competitors have significantly greater technical, manufacturing, financial and marketing resources than we do. We expect that more companies will enter the defense and aerospace component manufacturing market. We may not be able to compete successfully against either current or future competitors. Increased competition could result in reduced revenue, lower margins or loss of market share, any of which could significantly harm our business our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may lose sales if our suppliers fail to meet our needs.\nAlthough we procure most of our parts and components from multiple sources or believe that these components are readily available from numerous sources, certain components are available only from a sole or limited number or sources. While we believe that substitute components or assemblies could be obtained, use of substitutes would require development of new suppliers or would require us to re-engineer our products, or both, which could delay shipment of our products and could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThere are risks associated with the bidding processes in which we compete.\nWe obtain many contracts through a competitive bidding process. We must devote substantial time and resources to prepare bids and proposals and may not have contracts awarded to us. Even if we win contracts, there can be no assurance that the prices that we have bid will be sufficient to allow us to generate a profit from any particular contract. There are significant costs involved with producing a small number of initial units of any new product and it may not be possible to recoup such costs on later production runs.\nDue to fixed contract pricing, increasing contract costs expose us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business.\nThe cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant change in cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nThe prices of raw materials we use are volatile.\nThe prices of raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are volatile. If the prices of raw materials rise we may not be able to pass along such increases to our customers and this could have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Significant increases in the prices of raw materials could adversely impact our customers\u2019 demand for certain products which could lead to a reduction in our revenues and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe do not own the intellectual property rights to products we produce.\nNearly all the parts and subassemblies we produce are built to customer specifications and the customer owns the intellectual property, if any, related to the product. Consequently, if a customer desires to use another manufacturer to fabricate its part or subassembly, it would be free to do so.\nThere are risks associated with new programs.\nNew programs typically carry risks associated with design changes, acquisition of new production tools, funding commitments, imprecise or changing specifications, timing delays and the accuracy of cost estimates associated with such programs. In addition, any new program may experience delays for a variety of reasons after significant expenditures are made. If we were unable to perform under new programs to the customers\u2019 satisfaction or if a new program in which we had made a significant investment was terminated or experienced weak demand, delays or other problems, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. This could result in low margin or forward loss contracts, and the risk of having to write-off costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts if it were deemed to be unrecoverable over the life of the program.\nTo perform on new programs we may be required to incur up-front costs which may not have been separately negotiated. Additionally, we may have made assumptions related to the costs of any program which may be material and which may be incorrect, resulting in costs that are not recoverable. Such charges and the loss of up-front costs could have a material impact on our liquidity.\nOur inability to successfully manage the growth of our business may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe expect to experience growth in the number of employees and the scope of our operations as a result of internal growth and through acquisitions. This will result in increased responsibilities for management and could strain our financial and other resources. There can be no assurance that we will successfully integrate any future business acquired through acquisition.\nOur ability to manage and support our growth effectively is substantially dependent on our ability to implement adequate improvements to financial, inventory, management controls, reporting, union relationships, order entry systems and other procedures, and hire sufficient numbers of financial, accounting, administrative, and management personnel. We may not succeed in our efforts to identify, attract and retain experienced personnel.\nThere can be no assurance that we have the management expertise to successfully integrate the operations of any company that we might acquire in the future.\nOur future success also depends on our ability to address potential market opportunities and to manage expenses to match our ability to finance operations.\nThe need to control our expenses will place a significant strain on our management and operational resources. If we are unable to control our expenses effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nAttracting and retaining key personnel is an essential element of our future success.\nOur future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate executive and other key employees. Experienced management and technical, marketing and support personnel in the defense and aerospace industries are in demand and competition for their talents is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to strict governmental regulations relating to the environment, which could result in fines and remediation expense in the event of non-compliance.\nWe are required to comply with extensive and frequently changing environmental regulations at the federal, state and local levels. Among other things, these regulatory bodies impose restrictions to control air, soil and water pollution, to protect against occupational exposure to chemicals, including health and safety risks, and to require notification or reporting of the storage, use and release of certain hazardous substances into the environment. This extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks on us. In addition, these regulations may impose liability for the cost of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in our facilities without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of such substances. Furthermore, we are required to provide a place of employment that is free from recognized and preventable hazards that are likely to cause serious physical harm to employees, provide notice to employees regarding the presence of hazardous chemicals and to train employees in the use of such substances. Our operations require the use of chemicals and other materials for painting and cleaning that are classified under applicable laws as hazardous chemicals and substances. If we are found not to be in compliance with any of these rules, regulations or permits, we may be subject to fines, remediation expenses and the obligation to change our business practice, any of which could result in substantial costs that would adversely impact our business operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to fines and disqualification for non-compliance with Federal Aviation Administration regulations.\nWe are subject to regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration under the provisions of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended. The FAA prescribes standards and licensing requirements for aircraft and aircraft components. We are subject to inspections by the FAA and may be subjected to fines and other penalties (including orders to cease production) for noncompliance with FAA regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of or our disqualification from some of our contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We have never been subject to such fines or disqualification.\nTerrorist acts and acts of war may seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nUnited States and global responses to the Middle East conflict, terrorism, perceived nuclear, biological and chemical threats and other global crises increase uncertainties with respect to U.S. and other business and financial markets. Several factors associated, directly or indirectly, with the Middle East conflict, terrorism, perceived nuclear, biological and chemical threats, and other global crises and responses thereto, may adversely affect the Company.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur indebtedness may materially adversely affect our operations.\nAs is more fully described under the caption \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\", we have significant indebtedness. Our loan facility is secured by substantially all of our assets. In the case of a continuing default under our loan facility, the lender will have the right to foreclose on our assets, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Future payments of principal and interest or a change in policy by our lender may limit our ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders.\nOur leverage may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations and capital needs, may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities and may make our results of operations more susceptible to adverse economic conditions.\nOur Indebtedness may limit our ability to pay dividentds.\nThe terms of our Loan Facility with PNC requires that we maintain certain financial covenants and that we may pay a dividend only if after taking such dividend into effect we satisfy certain prescribed financial conditions. It is likely that any loan facility we might enter into in replace of the PNC Facility would contain similar provisions.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock and our Status as a Public Company\nThere is only a limited public market for our common stock.\nThe market for our common stock - as measured by the volume of trading - is limited. The lack of a robust market may impair a stockholder's ability to sell shares of our common stock. We cannot assure you that a more active trading market in our common stock will ever develop or if one does develop, that it will be sustained. In the absence of a more active trading market, any attempt to sell a substantial number of our shares could result in a decrease in the price of our stock. Specifically, you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for such shares or at all.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe number of shares of our common stock eligible for resale is enormous relative to the trading volume of our common stock. Any attempt to sell a substantial number of our shares will severely depress the market price of our common stock. In addition, we may use our capital stock in the future to finance acquisitions and to compensate employees and management, which will further dilute the interests of our existing shareholders and could eventually significantly depress the trading price of our common stock. Furthermore, we may sell additional shares of common stock if the Board deems it in our best interest.\nThe issuance of shares of our common stock, or the possible issuance of shares, under our stock option plan may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company, and the issuance of shares under the plan will decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to existing holders of our common stock and dilute their voting power.\nOur 2013 Equity Incentive Plan allows for the issuance of up to 600,000 shares of common stock, either as stock grants or options, to employees, officers, directors, advisors and consultants of the company. As of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding under the Plan options to purchase 528,247 shares. The committee administering the Plan, which has sole authority and discretion to grant options under the Plan, may grant options which become immediately exercisable in the event of a change in control of our company and in the event of certain mergers and reorganizations. The issuance of shares of our common stock, or the possible issuance of shares, under our stock option plan may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company, and the issuance of shares under the plan will decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to existing holders of our common stock and dilute their voting power.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nThe JOBS Act permits \"emerging growth companies\" like us to rely on some of the reduced disclosure requirements that are already available to companies having a public float of less than $75 million, for as long as we qualify as an emerging growth company. During that period, we are permitted to omit the auditor's attestation on internal control over financial reporting that would otherwise be required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Companies with a public float of $75 million or more must otherwise procure such an attestation beginning with their second annual report after their initial public offering. For as long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we are also excluded from the requirement to submit \"say-on-pay\", \"say-on-pay frequency\" and \"say-on-parachute\" votes to our stockholders and may avail ourselves of reduced executive compensation disclosure compared to larger companies. In addition, as described in the following risk factor, as an emerging growth company we can take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies.\nUntil such time as we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, investors may find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nAs an \"emerging growth company\" we may take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies.\nSection 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that, as an emerging growth company, we can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. Please refer to \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" for further discussion of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nAt such time as we cease to qualify as an \"emerging growth company\" under the JOBS Act, the costs and demands placed upon management will increase.\nWe will continue to be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as indexed for inflation), (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common stock under a registration statement under the Securities Act, December 31, 2018, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u2018large accelerated filer\u2019 as defined by the SEC, which would generally occur upon our attaining a public float of at least $700 million. Once we lose emerging growth company status, we expect the costs and demands placed upon management to increase, as we would have to comply with additional disclosure and accounting requirements, particularly if our public float should exceed $75 million.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance requirements, including establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting, and we may be exposed to potential risks if we are unable to comply with these requirements.\nAs a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, together with rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission and applicable market regulators. These rules impose various requirements on public companies, including requiring certain corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluations and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Compliance with Section 404 may require that we incur substantial accounting expenses and expend significant management efforts. Our testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. In the event we identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal controls that we cannot remediate in a timely manner, the market price of our stock could decline if investors and others lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other applicable regulatory authorities.\nOur future revenues are inherently unpredictable; our operating results are likely to fluctuate from period to period and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline significantly.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, some of which are outside our control. Accordingly, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of performance. Some of the factors that could cause quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate include conditions inherent in government contracting and our business such as the timing of cost and expense recognition for contracts, the United States Government contracting and budget cycles, introduction of new government regulations and standards, contract closeouts, variations in manufacturing efficiencies, our ability to obtain components and subassemblies from contract manufacturers and suppliers, general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to the defense market. Because we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term, any delay in generating or recognizing forecasted revenues could significantly harm our business.\nFluctuations in quarterly results, competition or announcements of extraordinary events such as acquisitions or litigation may cause earnings to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In this event, the trading price of our common stock could significantly decline. In addition, we cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop or be sustained for our common stock. These fluctuations, as well as general economic and market conditions, may adversely affect the future market price of our common stock, as well as our overall operating results.", "PERMNO": 13976, "SIC": 3728, "TIC": "AIRI"}
