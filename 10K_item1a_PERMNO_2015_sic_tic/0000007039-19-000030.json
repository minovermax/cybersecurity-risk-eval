{"cik": "7039", "company": "TRECORA RESOURCES", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global specialty petrochemical, specialty wax and mining (due to our investment in AMAK) businesses. Many of these risk factors are not within our control and could adversely affect our business, results of operations or our financial condition.\nWe rely on a limited number of customers, including one customer that represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in 2018. A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe rely on a limited number of customers. Our largest customer, ExxonMobil and its affiliates, represented approximately 17.0% of our consolidated revenues in 2018. A significant reduction in sales to any of our other key customers could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, and could result from our key customers further diversifying their product sourcing, experiencing financial difficulty or undergoing consolidation.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and we may lose market share to other producers of specialty petrochemicals, specialty waxes or other products that can be substituted for our products, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur industry is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from both large international producers and from smaller regional competitors. Our competitors may improve their competitive position in our core markets by successfully introducing new products, improving their manufacturing processes or expanding their capacity or manufacturing facilities. Further, some of our competitors benefit from advantageous cost positions that could make it increasingly difficult for us to compete in certain markets. If we are unable to keep pace with our competitors' product and manufacturing process innovations, cost position or alternative value proposition, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, we face increased competition from companies that may have greater financial resources and different cost structures, alternative values or strategic goals than us. We have a portfolio of businesses across which we must allocate our available resources, while competing companies may specialize in only certain of our product lines. As a result, we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors, and such competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources available to them. Industry consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous and stronger competitors in the markets in which we compete, and competitors also may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers. We may have to lower the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive, while at the same time, trying to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin.\nLoss of key employees, our inability to attract and retain new qualified employees or our inability to keep our employees focused on our strategies and goals could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees including those in managerial, technical, safety, sales and marketing positions. We must also keep employees focused on our strategies and goals. The failure to hire, or loss of, key employees in a competitive industry could have a significant adverse impact on our operations. In addition, an important component of our competitive performance is our ability to operate safely and efficiently, including our ability to manage expenses and minimize the production of low margin products on an on-going basis. This requires continuous management focus, including technological improvements, safe operations, cost control and productivity enhancements. The extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance relative to competition.\nWe do not control the activities of AMAK and are dependent on AMAK's management and board of directors.\nAlthough we believe that we have influence over the operating and financial policies of AMAK, we do not control AMAK's activities. The extent to which we are able to influence specific operating and financial decisions depends on our ability to persuade other AMAK board members and management regarding these policies. Our ability to persuade them may be adversely affected by cultural differences, differing accounting and management practices and differing governmental laws and regulations. In addition, we rely upon AMAK's management and board of directors to direct the operations of AMAK, including employing various engineering and financial advisors to assist in the development and evaluation of the mining projects in Saudi Arabia. We also rely on management of AMAK to provide timely, accurate financial information required for inclusion with our reports filed with the SEC.\nThere can be no assurance that our investment in AMAK will not be negatively impacted by the decisions made by AMAK's management and board of directors regarding AMAK's activities, including with respect to the selection and use of consultants and experienced personnel to manage the operation in Saudi Arabia.\nMaintenance, expansion and refurbishment of our facilities and the development and implementation of new manufacturing processes involve significant risks which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur facilities require periodic maintenance, upgrading, expansion, refurbishment or improvement. Any unexpected operational or mechanical failure, including failure associated with breakdowns and forced outages, could reduce our facilities' production capacity below expected levels which would reduce our revenues and profitability. Unanticipated expenditures associated with maintaining, upgrading, expanding, refurbishing or improving our facilities may also reduce profitability.\nIf we make any major modifications to our facilities, such modifications likely would result in substantial additional capital expenditures and may prolong the time necessary to bring the facility on line. We may also choose to refurbish or upgrade our facilities based on our assessment that such activity will provide adequate financial returns. However, such activities require time for development before commencement of commercial operations, and key assumptions underpinning a decision to make such an investment may prove incorrect, including assumptions regarding construction costs, demand growth and timing which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFinally, we may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes. Innovation in production processes involves significant expense and carries inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing new process technologies, development and production timing delays, lower than anticipated manufacturing yields, and product defects. Disruptions in the production process can also result from errors, defects in materials, delays in obtaining or revising operating permits and licenses, returns of product from customers, interruption in our supply of materials or resources and disruptions at our facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, or unsafe working conditions, all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields. Production issues can lead to increased costs and may affect our ability to meet product demand, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe covenants in the instruments that govern our outstanding indebtedness may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe covenants in the instruments that govern our outstanding indebtedness limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur indebtedness and liens;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase debt;\n\u2022\nengage in acquisitions, consolidations, asset dispositions, sale-leaseback transactions and affiliate transactions;\n\u2022\nchange our business;\n\u2022\namend some of our debt agreements; and\n\u2022\ngrant negative pledges to other creditors.\nIn addition, the ARC Agreement also has financial covenants that require TOCCO to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio and minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (each as defined in the ARC Agreement). See Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Credit Agreement.\nA failure by us or our subsidiaries to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default under such indebtedness, which could adversely affect our ability to respond to changes in our business and manage our operations. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of the agreements\ngoverning our indebtedness, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be due and payable and exercise other remedies as set forth in the agreements. Further, an event of default or acceleration of indebtedness under one instrument may constitute an event of default under another instrument. If any of our indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay this indebtedness in full, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.\nOur substantial indebtedness could limit cash flow available for our operations and could adversely affect our ability to service debt or obtain additional financing if necessary.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $18 million in borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility (the \"Revolving Facility\") and $84.5 million in borrowings outstanding under our term loan facility (the \"Term Loan Facility\" and, together with the Revolving Facility, the \"Credit Facilities\"). Pursuant to the terms of the amended and restated credit agreement (as amended to the date hereof, the \"ARC Agreement\") governing the Credit Facilities, we also have the option, at any time, to request an increase to the commitment under the Revolving Facility and/or the Term Loan Facility by an additional amount of up to $50.0 million in the aggregate, subject to lenders acceptance of the increased commitment and other conditions.\nAlthough the agreements governing our existing indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important exceptions, and additional indebtedness that we may incur from time to time to finance projects or for other reasons in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If we incur significant additional indebtedness, the related risks that we face could increase.\nOur current, or any future, indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the markets in which we compete;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to reinvest in our business;\n\u2022\nrender us more vulnerable to general adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our indebtedness.\nOur ability to meet our cash requirements, including our debt service obligations, is dependent upon our ability to maintain our operating performance, which will be subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our cash requirements and debt service obligations.\nConditions in the global economy may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe demand for our products have historically correlated closely with general economic growth rates. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative growth will typically have a direct adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes in population growth rates or periods of civil unrest, also impact the demand for our products. Economic conditions that impair the functioning of financial markets and financial institutions also pose risks to us, including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability of our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to us.\nIn addition, the revenue and profitability of our operations have historically been subject to fluctuation, which makes future financial results less predictable. Our revenue, gross margin and profit vary among our products, customer groups and geographic markets. Overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product, customer and geographic mix reflected in that period's net revenue. In addition, newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures. Market trends, competitive pressures, increased raw material or shipping costs, regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period which may necessitate adjustments to our operations.\nTo service our current, and any future, indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash, which may adversely affect our future results.\nOur ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt service obligations\ncould harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nIf our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness (or otherwise seek amendment or relief from the terms of our indebtedness), on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We might not generate sufficient cash flow to repay indebtedness as currently anticipated. In addition, we may not be able to effect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness, will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nThere are certain hazards and risks inherent in our operations that could adversely affect those operations and results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of diversified chemical products, our business is subject to operating risks inherent in chemical manufacturing, storage, handling and transportation. These risks include, but are not limited to, fires, explosions, severe weather and natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, loss of raw materials or our products, transportation interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, terrorist acts or war, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment and environmental contamination. In addition, our suppliers are also subject to similar risks that may adversely impact our production capabilities. A significant limitation on our ability to manufacture products due to disruption of manufacturing operations or related infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile we adapt our manufacturing and distribution processes and controls to minimize the inherent risk of our operations, to promote workplace safety and to minimize the potential for human error, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous or regulated materials, including injury of our employees, individuals who handle our products or goods treated with our products, or others who claim to have been exposed to our products, nor can we completely eliminate the unanticipated interruption or suspension of operations at our facilities due to such events. We may be held liable for significant damages or fines in the event of contamination or injury, and such assessed damages or fines could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions. Our property, business interruption and casualty insurance may not fully insure us against all potential hazards incidental to our business.\nIncreases in the costs of our raw materials could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations if those costs cannot be passed onto our customers.\nOur results of operations are directly affected by the cost of raw materials. Since the cost of these primary raw materials comprise a significant amount of our total cost of goods sold, the selling prices for our products and therefore our total revenue is impacted by movements in these raw material costs, as well as the cost of other inputs. In the past we have experienced erratic and significant changes in the costs of these raw materials, the cost of which has generally correlated with changes in energy prices, supply and demand factors, and prices for natural gas and crude oil. In addition, product mix can have an impact on our overall unit selling prices, since we provide an extensive product offering and therefore experience a wide range of unit selling prices. Because of the significant portion of our cost of goods sold represented by these raw materials, our gross profit margins could be adversely affected by changes in the cost of these raw materials if we are unable to pass the increases on to our customers.\nDue to volatile raw material prices, there can be no assurance that we can continue to recover raw material costs or retain customers in the future. For example, our logistics costs have increased substantially within the past three years, narrowing our profit margins. This may force us to increase our pricing, which could cause customers to consider competitors' products, some of which may be available at a lower cost. Significant loss of customers could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf the availability of our raw materials is limited, we may be unable to produce some of our products in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand or on favorable economic terms, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe use polyethylene waxes in our specialty synthetic wax segment and use additional non-primary raw materials in the production of our products in the specialty petrochemical segment and synthetic wax segment. Suppliers may not be able to meet our raw material requirements and we may not be able to obtain substitute supplies from alternative suppliers in sufficient quantities, on economic terms, or in a timely manner. A lack of timely availability of our raw materials in the quantities we require to produce our products could result in our inability to meet customer demand and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nCertain activist stockholders actions could cause us to incur expense and hinder execution of our strategy.\nWhile we seek to actively engage with our stockholders and consider their views on business and strategy, we could be subject to actions or proposals from our stockholders that do not align with our business strategies or the interests of our other stockholders. Responding to these stockholders could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our business and operations and divert the attention of our management. Furthermore, uncertainties associated with such activities could negatively impact our ability to execute our strategic plan, retain customers and skilled employees and affect long-term growth. In addition, such activities may cause our stock price to fluctuate based on temporary or speculative market perceptions that do not necessarily reflect our business operations.\nWe expect to continue to incur capital expenditures and operating costs as a result of our compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations.\nOur industry is subject to extensive laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operations with respect to, among other things: the discharge of pollutants into the environment; emissions into the atmosphere (including greenhouse gas emissions); and restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste. We are also subject to laws and regulations that require us to operate and maintain our facilities to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. In addition, failure to comply with these laws or regulations, or failure to obtain required permits from applicable regulatory authorities, may expose us to fines, penalties or interruptions in operations. To the extent these capital expenditures or operating costs are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, or that we are subject to fines, penalties or other interruptions in our operations, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to access third-party transportation for our raw materials and finished products, we may not be able to fulfill our obligations to our customers in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe rely upon transportation provided by third parties (including common carriers, rail companies and trans-ocean cargo companies) to receive raw materials used in the production of our products and to deliver finished products to our customers. While we attempt to offset the risks associated with third-party transportation issues, including by managing our supplies of raw materials, such mitigation efforts may not be successful. If we are unable to access third-party transportation at economically attractive rates, or at all, or if there is any other significant disruption in the availability of third-party transportation, we may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials (on favorable terms, or at all) to match the pace of production and/or we may not be able to fulfill our obligations to our customers in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we are not able to continue the technological innovation and successful commercial introduction of new products, our customers may turn to other producers to meet their requirements, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur industry and the markets into which we sell our products experience periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements. In addition, our customers may introduce new generations of their own products, adopt new or different risk profiles, or require new technological and increased performance specifications that would require us to develop customized products. Our future growth and profitability will depend on our ability to maintain or enhance technological capabilities, develop and market products and applications that meet changing customer requirements and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in a cost effective and timely manner. Our inability to maintain a technological edge, innovate and improve our products could cause a decline in the demand and sales of our products and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe are subject to numerous regulations that could require us to modify our current business practices and incur increased costs.\nWe are subject to numerous regulations, including customs and international trade laws, export control, data privacy, antitrust laws and zoning and occupancy laws that regulate manufacturers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of our products, the operation of our facilities and our relationship with our customers, suppliers and competitors. In addition, we face risk associated with trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs, imposition of new tariffs and duties and import and export licensing requirements. If these laws or regulations were to change or were violated by our management, employees, suppliers, buying agents or trading companies, the costs of certain goods could increase, or we could experience delays in shipments of our goods, be subject to fines or penalties, or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our products and hurt our business and negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, changes in federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws relating to employee benefits could cause us to incur additional wage and benefits costs, which could negatively impact our profitability.\nLegal requirements are frequently changed and subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effects on our operations. We may be required to make significant expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, which may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business.\nFailure to successfully consummate extraordinary transactions, including the integration of other businesses, assets, products or technologies, or realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any such transaction may adversely affect our future business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs part of our business strategy, we from time to time explore possible investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures and outsourcing transactions (collectively, \"extraordinary transactions\") in order to further our business objectives. To pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify suitable candidates for, and successfully complete, extraordinary transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses or employees. The expense and effort incurred in exploring and consummating extraordinary transactions, the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully, could result in additional and/or unexpected expenses and losses. We also may not be successful in negotiating the terms of any potential extraordinary transactions, conducting thorough due diligence, financing an extraordinary transaction or effectively integrating the acquired business, product or technology into our existing business and operations. Our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology. Moreover, we may incur significant expenses whether or not a contemplated extraordinary transaction is ultimately consummated.\nAdditionally, in connection with any extraordinary transaction we consummate, we many not fully realize all of the anticipated synergies and other benefits we expect to achieve (on our expected timeframe, or at all), and we may incur unanticipated expenses, write-downs, impairment charges or unforeseen liabilities that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions. Further, managing extraordinary transactions requires varying levels of management and employee resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations.\nThe adoption of climate change legislation or regulation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our products.\nThe nature of our operations could make us subject to legislation or regulations affecting the emission of greenhouse gases. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has promulgated (and may in the future promulgate) regulations applicable to projects involving greenhouse gas emissions above a certain threshold, and the U.S. and certain states within the U.S. have enacted, or are considering, limitations on greenhouse gas emissions. Jurisdictions outside the U.S. are also addressing greenhouse gases by legislation or regulation. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made at the international level toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global greenhouse gas emissions. These limitations may include the adoption of cap and trade regimes, carbon taxes, restrictive permitting, increased efficiency standards and incentives or mandates for renewable energy. Any such requirements could make our products more expensive, lengthen project implementation times and reduce demand for hydrocarbons, as well as shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower-carbon sources. Such legislation, regulation, treaties or protocols may also increase our compliance costs, such as for monitoring or sequestering emissions.\nAdverse results of legal proceedings could materially adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to and may in the future be subject to a variety of legal proceedings and claims that arise out of the ordinary conduct of our business, including legal proceedings brought in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Irrespective of its merits, litigation may be both lengthy and disruptive to our operations and may cause significant expenditure and diversion of management attention. We may be faced with significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us that could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations should we fail to prevail in certain matters.\nCost pressures could negatively impact AMAK's operating margins and expansion plans.\nCost pressures may continue to occur across the resources industry. As the prices for AMAK's products are determined by the global commodity markets in which it operates, AMAK does not generally have the ability to offset these cost pressures through corresponding price increases, which can adversely affect its operating margins or require changes in operations, including, but not limited to, temporary planned shutdowns. Notwithstanding AMAK's efforts to reduce costs, and a number of key cost inputs being commodity price-linked, the inability to reduce costs and a timing lag may adversely impact AMAK's operating margins for an extended period.\nAn impairment of goodwill could negatively impact our results of operations.\nAt least annually, we assess goodwill for impairment. If an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, additional quantitative testing is performed. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to quantitative testing. If the quantitative testing indicates that goodwill is impaired, the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value with a charge against earnings. Since we utilize a discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of our operating units, continued weak demand for a specific product line or business could result in an impairment charge. Accordingly, any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facilities are, and additional borrowings in the future may be, at variable rates of interest that expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed will remain the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. We may in the future enter into, interest rate swaps for our variable rate debt whereby we exchange floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce exposure to interest rate volatility. However, any interest rate swaps into which we enter may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nWe are exposed to local business risks in different countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we do not have production operations and assets outside of the U.S., we do have a global portfolio of customers and thus we are subject to a variety of international market risks including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nongoing instability or changes in a country's or region's economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations, civil unrest and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts (including the potential impact of continued hostilities and conflict in Yemen on the operations of AMAK);\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable cycles and financial instability or credit risk among customers and distributors;\n\u2022\ntrade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production, pricing and marketing of products, including domestic and foreign customs and tariffs or other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nregulations favoring local contractors or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a local jurisdiction;\n\u2022\nlocal labor conditions and regulations and the geographical dispersion of the workforce;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory or legal environment;\n\u2022\ndiffering technology standards or customer requirements;\n\u2022\nimport, export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments, which could affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for labor and raw materials or lead to penalties or restrictions;\n\u2022\ndata privacy regulations;\n\u2022\nrisk of non-compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar anti-bribery legislation in other countries by agents or other third-party representatives;\n\u2022\nrisk of nationalization of private enterprises by foreign governments (including the risk that AMAK's mining and exploration leases may be terminated by the Saudi Ministry of Petroleum and Minerals);\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange restrictions and fluctuations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner and changes in tax laws; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in freight costs and disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments.\nSuch economic and political uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in ways that cannot be predicted at this time. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, they could result in a decrease in demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to our customers or to receive raw materials from our suppliers and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain. We are also predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts, conflicts and wars.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities, which may adversely affect our financial position.\nWe are subject to income taxes and state taxes in the U.S. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different to that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Should any tax authority take issue with our estimates, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") was enacted on December 22, 2017, and introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Accounting Standards Codification 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, requires companies to recognize the effects of tax law changes in the period of enactment. Effective in 2018, the TCJA made a number changes, such as reducing the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%, creating new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings and certain related-party payments, which are referred to as the global intangible low taxed income tax and the base erosion tax, respectively, establishing a dividends received deduction for dividends paid by foreign subsidiaries to the U.S., the elimination or limitation of certain deductions, and imposing a mandatory tax on previously unrepatriated earnings accumulated offshore. Due to the timing of the new tax law provided in the TCJA and the substantial changes it brings, the Staff of the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which provides registrants with a measurement period to report the impact of the new US tax law. As a result, the recorded and estimated impacts of the TCJA may change in future periods, which may adversely affect our estimates, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nAMAK is also subject to various taxes in Saudi Arabia. While AMAK currently benefits from certain tax credits that reduce its overall tax liability, there can be no assurance that relevant tax authorities will continue to maintain such credits. In addition, there can be no assurances that future changes in tax law in Saudi Arabia will not result in increased tax liability to AMAK. A material increase in tax liability could have an adverse effect on AMAK's results of operations and financial condition, which may in turn have an adverse effect on our investment in AMAK.\nWe from time to time are subject to contingent liabilities. If any contingent liabilities become actual liabilities, our financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to various contingent liabilities that may affect our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations, including our limited corporate guarantee to SIDF in connection with AMAK's Loan to fund mining operations. To the extent any of our current or future contingent liabilities become actual liabilities, it may have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe may be unable to recover our investment in AMAK, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe will only recover our investment in AMAK through the receipt of distributions or future share repurchases from AMAK or the sale of part or all of our interest in AMAK. If AMAK does not continue to be profitable, our ability to recover our investment will be adversely affected. Moreover, if AMAK continues to be profitable, there can be no assurance that the board of directors of AMAK will determine that it is in the best interests of AMAK and its shareholders to make distributions to its shareholders or to initiate additional share repurchases. In addition, we understand that AMAK is required to sell a portion of its equity to the public once AMAK has been profitable for two years. While the proceeds of such a sale might allow us to recover our investment in AMAK, there is no assurance that the market conditions for any such public sale will be favorable enough to allow us to recover our investment or that some or all of our shares in AMAK will be include in any such sale. To the extent we are unable to recover our investments in AMAK, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nAMAK may have fewer mineral reserves than its estimates indicate.\nFluctuations in the price of commodities, variation in production costs or different recovery rates could result in AMAK's estimated reserves being revised in the future. If such a revision were to indicate a substantial reduction in proven or probable reserves at one or more of AMAK's projects, it could adversely affect our investment in AMAK.\nDomestic or international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations or otherwise have an adverse impact on our business.\nIt is possible that further acts of terrorism may be directed against the U.S. domestically or abroad, and such acts of terrorism could be directed against our investment in those locations. Moreover, chemical related assets, and U.S. corporations such as ours, may be at a greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets. The resulting damage from such an event could include loss of life, property damage or site closure. Any, or a combination, of these factors could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIncreased information systems security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.\nIncreased information systems security threats and more sophisticated, targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data, operations, and communications. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including security measures, employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, if these measures prove inadequate, we could be adversely affected by, among other things, loss or damage of intellectual property, proprietary and confidential information, and communications or customer data, having our business operations interrupted and increased costs to prevent, respond to, or mitigate these cyber security threats. Any significant disruption or slowdown of our systems could cause customers to cancel orders or standard business processes to become inefficient or ineffective, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nImplementation of changes to our enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") system may adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting.\nDuring 2017, we implemented a new ERP system at our specialty petrochemical facility in order to better manage our business, and we continue to implement additional improvements to the system. ERP implementations are complex and time-consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities over a significant period of time. If we do not effectively implement changes to ERP system, or if the system does not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial reporting systems and our ability to produce financial reports, the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting (including our disclosure controls and procedures), and our business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 14761, "SIC": 2911, "TIC": "TREC"}
