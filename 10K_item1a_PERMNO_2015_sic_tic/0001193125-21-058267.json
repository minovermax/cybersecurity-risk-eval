These risks could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, cause the trading price of our common stock to decline materially or cause our actual results to differ materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. These risks are not exclusive, and additional risks to which we are subject include, but are not limited to, the factors mentioned under \u201cCautionary note regarding forward-looking statements\u201d and the risks of our businesses described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2020.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following summarizes material risks to the Company and is qualified by the full description contained below herewith. The occurrence of any of the following risks or of unknown risks and uncertainties may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nStrategic Risks\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to successfully execute strategic plans to effectively address our current business challenges.\n\u2022\nThe proposed transaction with China Oceanwide may be terminated or may not be completed under the terms or in the manner previously anticipated, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our stock price.\n\u2022\nCOVID-19\ncould materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Estimates, Assumptions and Valuations\n\u2022\nIf our reserves for future policy claims are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nIf the models used in our businesses are inaccurate or there are differences and/or variability in loss development compared to our model estimates and actuarial assumptions, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nWe may be required to increase our reserves in our long-term care insurance, life insurance and/or annuity businesses as a result of deviations from our estimates and actuarial assumptions or other reasons, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nWe may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the present value of future profits, which would increase our expenses and reduce profitability.\n\u2022\nWhen we have projected profits in earlier years followed by projected losses in later years (as is currently the case with our long-term care insurance business), we are required to increase our reserve liabilities over time to offset the projected future losses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nOur valuation of fixed maturity, equity and trading securities uses methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to change and differing interpretations which could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nLiquidity, Financial Strength and Credit Ratings, and Counterparty and Credit Risks\n\u2022\nOur internal sources of liquidity may be insufficient to meet our needs and our access to capital may be limited or unavailable. Under such conditions, we may seek additional capital but may be unable to obtain it.\n\u2022\nAs holding companies, we and Genworth Holdings depend on the ability of our respective subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments and distributions to each of us and to meet our obligations.\n\u2022\nAdverse rating agency actions have resulted in a loss of business and adversely affected our results of operations, financial condition and business and future adverse rating actions could have a further and more significant adverse impact on us.\n\u2022\nDefaults by counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements or to derivative instruments we use to hedge our business risks, or defaults by us on agreements we have with these counterparties, may expose us to risks we sought to mitigate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nDefaults or other events impacting the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio may reduce our income.\nRisks Relating to Economic, Market and Political Conditions\n\u2022\nInterest rates and changes in rates could materially adversely affect our business and profitability.\n\u2022\nA deterioration in economic conditions or a decline in home prices may adversely affect our loss experience in our mortgage insurance businesses.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\n\u2022\nOur insurance businesses are extensively regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth.\n\u2022\nLitigation and regulatory investigations or other actions are common in the insurance business and may result in financial losses and harm our reputation.\n\u2022\nAn adverse change in our regulatory requirements, including risk-based capital, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\n\u2022\nChanges to the role of the GSEs or to the charters or business practices of the GSEs, including actions or decisions to decrease or discontinue the use of mortgage insurance, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or significantly impact our business.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs because the GSEs amend them or the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the financial requirements requires us to hold amounts of capital that are higher than we have planned or otherwise, we may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u2022\nOur U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum statutory capital requirements, which if not met or waived, would result in restrictions or prohibitions on our doing business and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\n\u2022\nChanges in regulations that adversely affect the mortgage insurance markets in which we operate could affect our operations significantly and could reduce the demand for mortgage insurance.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to continue to mitigate the impact of Regulations XXX or AXXX and, therefore, we may incur higher operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nChanges in accounting and reporting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies and insurance regulators could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational Risks\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to retain, attract and motivate qualified employees or senior management, our results of operations, financial condition and business operations may be adversely impacted.\n\u2022\nOur reliance on key customer or distribution relationships could cause us to lose significant sales if one or more of those relationships terminate or are reduced.\n\u2022\nWe compete with government-owned and government-sponsored enterprises in our mortgage insurance businesses, and this may put us at a competitive disadvantage on pricing and other terms and conditions.\n\u2022\nOur business could be adversely impacted from deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting.\n\u2022\nOur computer systems may fail or be compromised, and unanticipated problems could materially adversely impact our disaster recovery systems and business continuity plans, which could damage our reputation, impair our ability to conduct business effectively and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nInsurance and Product-Related Risks\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to maintain or increase the capital needed in our U.S. mortgage insurance business in a timely manner, on anticipated terms or at all, including through improved business performance, reinsurance or similar transactions, asset sales, securities offerings or otherwise, in each case as and when required.\n\u2022\nOur financial condition, results of operations, long-term care insurance products and/or our reputation in the market may be adversely affected if we are unable to implement premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions on our in-force\nlong-term care insurance policies by enough or quickly enough.\n\u2022\nReinsurance may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses.\n\u2022\nA decrease in the volume of high loan-to-value\nhome mortgage originations or an increase in the volume of mortgage insurance cancellations could result in a decline in our revenue in our mortgage insurance businesses.\n\u2022\nThe amount of mortgage insurance we write could decline significantly if alternatives to private mortgage insurance are used or lower coverage levels of mortgage insurance are selected.\n\u2022\nPotential liabilities in connection with our U.S. contract underwriting services could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nMedical advances, such as genetic research and diagnostic imaging, and related legislation could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our life insurance, long-term care insurance and annuity businesses.\nOther General Risk\n\u2022\nThe occurrence of natural or man-made\ndisasters or a future pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nStrategic Risks\nWe may be unable to successfully execute strategic plans to effectively address our current business challenges.\nWe continue to pursue our overall strategy with a focus on improving business performance, reducing financial leverage and increasing financial and strategic flexibility across the organization. Our strategy includes maximizing our opportunities in our mortgage insurance businesses and stabilizing our U.S. life insurance businesses. See \u201cItem 1 - Business-Strategic Update.\u201d\nWe cannot be sure we will be able to successfully execute on any of our strategic plans to effectively address our current business challenges (including with respect to addressing our debt maturities and other near-term liabilities and financial obligations, reducing costs, stabilizing our U.S. life insurance businesses without additional capital contributions, overall capital and ratings), including as a result of: (a) a failure to complete the China Oceanwide transaction or the inability to pursue alternative strategic plans pending the outcome of the transaction; (b) an inability to attract buyers for any businesses or other assets we may seek to sell, or securities we may seek to issue (including a potential partial sale through an initial public offering of our U.S. mortgage insurance business) in each case, in a timely manner and on anticipated terms; (c) an inability to increase the capital needed in our businesses in a timely manner and on anticipated terms, including through improved business performance, reinsurance or similar transactions, asset sales, debt issuances, securities offerings or otherwise, in each case as and when required; (d) a failure to obtain any required regulatory, stockholder, noteholder approvals and/or other third-party approvals or consents for such alternative strategic plans; (e) our challenges changing or being more costly or difficult to successfully address than currently anticipated or the benefits achieved being less than anticipated; (f) an inability to achieve anticipated cost-savings in a timely manner; and (g) adverse tax or accounting charges.\nGiven uncertainty around the completion and timing of the remaining steps required to close the China Oceanwide transaction, we are focusing on executing alternative plans, including a potential partial initial public offering of our U.S. mortgage insurance business and/or the issuance of debt, convertible or equity-linked securities, prior to our senior notes maturing in September 2021. We will also continue to remain open to other feasible alternatives and actively assess our strategic options, which could include reducing ownership of or selling businesses, including in transactions that would be material to us. We may be unable to reduce ownership of or sell businesses on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may decide to take additional measures to increase our financial flexibility, in the absence of the China Oceanwide transaction, including issuing equity at Genworth Financial which would be dilutive to our shareholders, or additional debt at Genworth Financial, Genworth Holdings or GMHI (including debt convertible into equity), which could increase our leverage. The availability of any additional debt or equity funding will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory considerations, the general availability of credit and particularly important to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity and the performance of and outlook for our company and our businesses. Market conditions may make it difficult to obtain funding or complete asset sales to generate additional liquidity, especially on short notice and when the demand for additional funding in the market is high. Our access to funding may be further impaired by our credit or financial strength ratings and our financial condition. See \u201c-Our internal sources of liquidity may be insufficient to meet our needs and our access to capital may be limited or unavailable. Under such conditions, we may seek additional capital but may be unable to obtain it.\u201d\nEven if we are successful in executing our strategic plans or alternative plans, the execution of these plans may have expected or unexpected adverse consequences, including adverse rating actions and adverse tax and accounting charges (such as significant losses on sale of businesses or assets or deferred acquisition costs (\u201cDAC\u201d) or deferred tax asset write-offs).\nThe proposed transaction with China Oceanwide may be terminated or may not be completed under the terms or in the manner previously anticipated, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our stock price.\nOn October 21, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement with China Oceanwide, under which China Oceanwide agreed to acquire all of our outstanding common stock for a total transaction value of approximately $2.7 billion, or $5.43 per share in cash. As part of the transaction, China Oceanwide and/or its affiliates, additionally committed to contribute an aggregate of $1.5 billion to us over time following consummation of the Merger. On January 4, 2021, we announced that an extension of the then current December 31, 2020 Merger Agreement end date would not be sought given uncertainty around the completion and timing of the remaining steps required to close the transaction. Even though the Merger Agreement remains in effect, either party is able to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time. In addition, if China Oceanwide is able to secure the required funding to close the transaction, the parties would need to re-engage with their regulators to determine the re-approvals or confirmations that would be necessary to close the transaction.\nThere are numerous risks related to the transaction, including the following:\n\u2022\nChina Oceanwide and/or Genworth decides to terminate the Merger Agreement or that China Oceanwide will be unable to complete the funding of the transaction and/or the transaction may not be completed, any of which may adversely affect our business and the price of our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe parties\u2019 inability to obtain regulatory approvals, clearances or extensions, or the possibility that such regulatory approvals or clearances may further delay the transaction, to the extent the transaction is pursued, or that materially burdensome or adverse regulatory conditions may be imposed or undesirable measures may be required in connection with any such regulatory approvals, clearances or extensions (including those conditions or measures that either or both of the parties may be unwilling to accept or undertake, as applicable);\n\u2022\nwith continuing delays, circumstances may arise that make one or both parties unwilling to proceed with the transaction or unable to comply with the conditions to existing regulatory approvals or one or both of the parties may be unwilling to accept any new condition under a regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nthe parties will not be able to obtain regulatory approvals, clearances or extensions, including in connection with a potential alternative funding structure or the current geo-political\nenvironment;\n\u2022\none or more regulators may rescind or fail to extend previous approvals, or the revocation by one regulator of approvals may lead to the revocation of approvals by other regulators;\n\u2022\nthe parties\u2019 inability to obtain any necessary regulatory approvals, clearances or extensions for the post-closing capital plan;\n\u2022\na condition to closing the transaction may not be satisfied or that a condition to closing that is currently satisfied may not remain satisfied due to the delay in closing the transaction or that the parties are unable to agree upon all terms following receipt of all regulatory approvals and clearances;\n\u2022\nexisting and potential legal proceedings may be instituted against us in connection with the transaction that may delay the transaction, make it more costly or ultimately preclude it;\n\u2022\npotential legal proceedings may be instituted against us in connection with the transaction delay and/or its termination;\n\u2022\nthe proposed transaction or its termination disrupts Genworth\u2019s current plans and operations;\n\u2022\npotential adverse reactions or changes to Genworth\u2019s business relationships with clients, employees, suppliers or other parties or other business uncertainties resulting from the announcement of the transaction or during the pendency of the transaction or as a result of the termination of the transaction, including but not limited to such changes that could affect Genworth\u2019s financial performance;\n\u2022\ncontinued availability of capital and financing to Genworth under acceptable terms before, or in the absence of, the consummation of the transaction;\n\u2022\nfurther rating agency actions and downgrades in Genworth\u2019s credit or financial strength ratings;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nour ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of the transaction;\n\u2022\nthe amount of the costs, fees, expenses and other charges related to the transaction, including costs and expenses related to conditions imposed in connection with regulatory approvals, re-approvals\nor clearances, and costs, fees and expenses and other charges already incurred, all of which may be material;\n\u2022\nthe inability to reduce costs due to the delay or termination of the transaction, including in connection with any proposed resource alignment;\n\u2022\nthe risks related to diverting management\u2019s attention from our ongoing business operations; and\n\u2022\nour ability to attract, recruit, retain and motivate current and prospective employees may be adversely affected.\nThere is no assurance that the conditions to the transaction will be satisfied in the near future, on the terms set forth in our existing agreement with China Oceanwide or at all. If the transaction is not completed, we would likely suffer a number of consequences that could adversely affect our stock price, business, results of operations and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in executing alternative strategic plans to effectively address our near-term liabilities and financial obligations, including the risks that we will be unable to raise additional debt financing and/or sell a percentage of our ownership interest in our U.S. mortgage insurance business to repay/refinance debt maturities in 2021 and beyond and the promissory note to AXA;\n\u2022\ninability to reduce costs through alignment of our current expense structure with anticipated business needs;\n\u2022\nstabilizing our U.S. life insurance businesses without additional capital contributions and preserving capital;\n\u2022\nincreased pressure on and potential further downgrades of our credit and financial strength ratings, particularly for our mortgage insurance businesses, which could have an adverse impact on our mortgage insurance businesses and could result in a reduction or elimination of dividends to our holding company; and\n\u2022\nwe would likely pursue strategic alternatives that would materially impact our business, including a transaction with respect to our U.S. mortgage insurance business and/or our mortgage insurance business in Australia.\nPotential consequences of these risks would likely include, among other things, business disruption, operational problems, financial loss, legal liability to third parties and similar risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Genworth\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, credit ratings or liquidity.\nIn addition, we have incurred, and may continue to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the transaction, and these fees and costs are payable by us regardless of whether the transaction is consummated.\nCOVID-19\ncould materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCOVID-19\nhas brought unprecedented changes to the global economy. Large scale disruption in the U.S. economy has left several industries non-operational\nthrough state and federal mandated shutdowns in an effort to contain the spread of COVID-19.\nUnemployment claims have increased significantly, reducing consumer\nconfidence to its lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis. The level of uncertainty created by COVID-19\nis far-reaching\nand difficult to estimate. Our financial results have been negatively impacted by COVID-19,\nand we are unsure of the ultimate impact the pandemic will have on our business, including economic and operational, as current conditions continue to evolve rapidly. COVID-19\nexposes our business to significant risks, including interest rate declines, significantly higher levels of unemployment, liquidity pressures, credit risk on our investment portfolio, equity market volatility, and operational, information technology and personnel risks. We could experience significant declines in investment valuations, including as a result of credit losses, and potential material asset impairments, as well as unexpected changes in persistency rates, as policyholders and contractholders who are affected by the pandemic may not be able to meet their contractual obligations, such as mortgage payments on their loans insured by our mortgage insurance policies, premium payments on their insurance policies or deposits to their investment products. The pandemic has decreased historically low interest rates further and has resulted in significantly higher levels of unemployment, which has and may continue to increase delinquencies, and could reduce mortgage originations, the need for mortgage insurance and have an adverse effect on home prices, all of which would result in a significant adverse impact to our financial condition and results of operations in our mortgage insurance businesses. Losses in our mortgage insurance businesses could lead to lower credit ratings and impaired capital, which could hinder our mortgage insurance businesses from offering their products, preclude them from returning capital to our holding company for prolonged periods of time, and thereby harm our liquidity. The pandemic could also significantly increase our mortality and morbidity experience and/or impact our ability to successfully implement in-force\nrate actions (including increased premiums and associated benefit reductions), all of which could result in higher reserve charges and an adverse impact to our financial results in our U.S. life insurance businesses. COVID-19\ncould also disrupt medical and financial services and has resulted in us practicing social distancing with our employees through office closures, all of which could disrupt our normal business operations. The level of disruption, the economic downturn, the global recession, and the far-reaching\neffects of COVID-19\ncould negatively affect our investment portfolio and cause harm to our businesses if it persists for long periods of time. As a result of the foregoing, any of the risks identified above or other related COVID-19\nrisks may have a material adverse impact on us, including a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Estimates, Assumptions and Valuations\nIf our reserves for future policy claims are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe calculate and maintain reserves for estimated future payments of claims to our policyholders and contractholders in accordance with U.S. GAAP and industry accounting practices. We release these reserves as those future obligations are paid, experience changes or policies lapse. The reserves we establish reflect estimates and actuarial assumptions with regard to our future experience. These estimates and actuarial assumptions involve the exercise of significant judgment. Our future financial results depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual future experience is consistent with the assumptions and methodologies we have used in pricing our products and calculating our reserves. Small changes in assumptions or small deviations of actual experience from assumptions can have, and in the past have had, material impacts on our reserves, results of operations and financial condition. Many factors, and changes in these factors, can affect future experience, including but not limited to: interest rates; investment returns and volatility; economic and social conditions, such as inflation, unemployment, home price appreciation or depreciation, and health care experience (including the type of care, and cost of care); policyholder persistency or lapses (i.e., the probability that a policy or contract will remain in-force\nfrom one period to the next); insured mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity); insured morbidity (i.e., frequency and severity of claim, including claim termination rates, claim incidence, duration of claim and benefit utilization rates); future premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions; expenses; and doctrines of legal liability and damage awards in litigation. Because these factors are not known in advance, change over time, are difficult to accurately predict and are inherently uncertain, we cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts we will pay for actual claims or the timing of those payments. For information regarding adequacy of reserves specifically related to our long-term care insurance, life insurance and annuities\nbusinesses, see \u201c-We may be required to increase our reserves in our long-term care insurance, life insurance and/or annuity businesses as a result of deviations from our estimates and actuarial assumptions or other reasons, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nWe regularly review our reserves and associated assumptions as part of our ongoing assessment of our business performance and risks. If we conclude that our reserves are insufficient to cover actual or expected policy and contract benefits and claim payments as a result of changes in experience, assumptions or otherwise, we would be required to increase our reserves and incur charges in the period in which we make the determination. The amounts of such increases may be significant and this could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFor additional information on reserves, including the financial impact of some of these risks, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Insurance liabilities and reserves.\u201d\nIf the models used in our businesses are inaccurate or there are differences and/or variability in loss development compared to our model estimates and actuarial assumptions, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe employ models to, among other uses, price products, calculate reserves, value assets, make investment decisions and generate projections used to estimate future pre-tax\nincome, such as the timing of the recognition of earned premium in our mortgage insurance businesses that offer single premium insurance contracts, and to evaluate loss recognition testing, as well as to evaluate risk, determine internal capital requirements and perform stress testing. These models rely on estimates and projections that are inherently uncertain, may use data and/or assumptions (that could remain locked in over an extended period of time) that do not adequately reflect recent experience and relevant industry data, and may not operate as intended. In addition, from time to time we seek to improve certain actuarial and financial models, and the conversion process may result in material changes to assumptions and financial results. The models we employ are complex, which increases our risk of error in their design, implementation or use. Also, the associated input data, assumptions and calculations and the controls we have in place to mitigate these risks may not be effective in all cases. The risks related to our models often increase when we change assumptions and/or methodologies, add or change modeling platforms or implement model changes under time constraints. These risks are exacerbated when the process for assumption changes strains our overall governance and timing around our financial reporting.\nFor our mortgage insurance businesses that offer single premium insurance contracts, recognition of earned premiums involves significant estimates and assumptions as to future loss development and policy cancellations. These assumptions are based on our historical experience and our expectations of future performance, which are highly dependent on modeling assumptions as to long-term macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, home price appreciation and the rate of unemployment. In our mortgage insurance business in Australia, the majority of our current insurance contracts have a single premium, which is paid at the beginning of the contract. For single premium insurance contracts, we recognize premiums over the policy life in accordance with the expected pattern of risk emergence. We recognize a portion of the revenue in premiums earned in the current period, while the remaining portion is deferred as unearned premiums and earned over time in accordance with the expected pattern of risk emergence.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $1.5 billion of unearned premiums in our mortgage insurance businesses, of which $1.2 billion related to our mortgage insurance business in Australia. We periodically review our expected pattern of risk emergence and make adjustments to earnings patterns based on actual experience and changes in our expectation of future performance with any adjustments reflected in current period net income, which in the past has had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business. See \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Mortgage insurance-Unearned\npremiums\u201d for additional details. Our expected pattern of risk emergence for our mortgage insurance businesses is subject to change given the inherent uncertainty as to the underlying loss development and policy cancellation assumptions and the long duration of our mortgage insurance policy contracts. Therefore, actual future experience that is different than expected loss development or policy cancellations could result in material increases or decreases in the recognition of earned premiums, increases or decreases in unearned premiums and an after-tax\ncharge to operating results depending on the magnitude of the difference between actual and expected experience.\nIn our U.S. life insurance businesses, we intend to continue developing our modeling capabilities. During or after the implementation of model updates or enhancements, we may discover errors or other deficiencies in existing models, assumptions and/or methodologies. Moreover, we may use additional, more granular and detailed information through enhancements in our reserving and other processes or we may employ more simplified approaches in the future, either of which may cause us to refine or otherwise change existing assumptions and/or methodologies and thus associated reserve levels, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be required to increase our reserves in our long-term care insurance, life insurance and/or annuity businesses as a result of deviations from our estimates and actuarial assumptions or other reasons, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe expected future profitability of our long-term care insurance, life insurance and some annuity products are based upon assumptions for, among other things, projected interest rates and investment returns, health care experience, morbidity rates, mortality rates, in-force\nrate actions, persistency, lapses and expenses. The long-term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual experience compares with our pricing and valuation assumptions. If any of our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our reserves may be inadequate, which in the past has had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business. For example, if morbidity rates are higher than our valuation assumptions, we could be required to make greater payments and thus establish additional reserves under our long-term care insurance policies than we had expected, and such amounts could be significant. Likewise, if mortality rates are lower than our valuation assumptions, we could be required to make greater payments and thus establish additional reserves under both our long-term care insurance policies and annuity contracts and such amounts could be significant. Conversely, if mortality rates are higher than our pricing and valuation assumptions, we could be required to make greater payments under our life insurance policies and annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum death benefits (\u201cGMDBs\u201d) than we had projected. Moreover, changes in the assumptions we use can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Even small changes in assumptions or small deviations of actual experience from assumptions can have, and in the past have had, material impacts on our DAC amortization, reserve levels, results of operations and financial condition.\nFor example, we increased our reserves for our long-term care and/or life insurance products following completion of our annual review of assumptions in 2019 and 2018, which materially impacted our results of operations. See \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d and note 9 in our consolidated financial statements under \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information. Increases to our reserves may, among other things, limit our ability to execute our alternative strategic plans if the proposed transaction with China Oceanwide is not completed; reduce our liquidity; and adversely impact our credit or financial strength ratings. Any of these results could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe risk that our claims experience may differ significantly from our valuation assumptions is particularly significant for our long-term care insurance products. Long-term care insurance policies provide for long-duration coverage and, therefore, our actual claims experience will emerge over many years, or decades, after both pricing and locked-in\nvaluation assumptions have been established. For example, among other factors,\nchanges in economic and interest rate risk, socio-demographics, behavioral trends (e.g., location of care and level of benefit use) and medical advances, may have a material adverse impact on our future claims trends. Moreover, long-term care insurance does not have the extensive claims experience history of life insurance. As a consequence, given that recent experience will represent a larger proportion of total experience, our long-term care insurance assumptions will be more heavily influenced by recent experience. It follows that our ability to forecast future claim costs for long-term care insurance is more limited than for life insurance. For additional information on our long-term care insurance reserves, including the significant historical financial impact of some of these risks, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Insurance liabilities and reserves.\u201d\nThe prices and expected future profitability of our insurance and annuity products are based in part upon expected patterns of premiums, expenses and benefits, using a number of assumptions, including those related to persistency, which is the probability that a policy or contract will remain in-force\nfrom one period to the next. The effect of persistency on profitability varies for different products. For most of our life insurance and deferred annuity products, actual persistency that is lower than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse impact on profitability, primarily because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy or contract. For our deferred annuity products with GMWBs and guaranteed annuitization benefits, actual persistency that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse impact on profitability because we could be required to make withdrawal or annuitization payments for a longer period of time than the account value would support. For our universal life insurance contracts, increased persistency that is the result of the sale of contracts by the insured to third parties that continue to make premium payments on contracts that would otherwise have lapsed, also known as life settlements, could have an adverse impact on profitability because of the higher claims rate associated with settled contracts.\nFor our long-term care insurance policies, actual persistency in later policy durations that is higher than our persistency assumptions could have a negative impact on profitability. If these policies remain in-force\nlonger than we assumed, then we could be required to make greater benefit payments than we had anticipated when we priced these products. This risk is particularly significant in our long-term care insurance business because we do not have the experience history that we have in our life insurance business. As a result, our ability to predict persistency and resulting benefit experience for long-term care insurance is more limited than for many other products. A significant number of our long-term care insurance policies have experienced higher persistency than we had originally assumed, which has resulted in higher claims and an adverse effect on the profitability of that business. In addition, the impact of inflation on claims could be more pronounced for our long-term care insurance business than our other businesses given the \u201clong tail\u201d nature of this business. To the extent inflation or other factors causes these health care costs to increase, we will be required to increase our policy and claim reserves which could negatively impact our loss recognition testing results and may result in a premium deficiency. Although we consider the potential effects of inflation when setting premium rates, our premiums may not fully offset the effects of inflation and may result in our underpricing of the risks we insure.\nThe risk that our lapse experience may differ significantly from our valuation assumptions is also significant for our term life and term universal life insurance products. These products generally have a level premium period for a specified period of years (e.g., 10 years to 30 years) after which the premium increases, which may be significant. If the frequency of lapses is higher than our reserve assumptions, we would experience higher DAC amortization and lower premiums and could experience higher benefit costs. In addition, it may be that healthy policyholders are the ones who lapse (as they can more easily replace coverage), creating adverse selection where less healthy policyholders remain in our portfolio. We have experienced both a greater frequency of policyholder lapses and more severe adverse selection, after the level premium period, and this experience could continue or worsen. For example, as our large 10- and 15-year level premium period term life insurance policies written in 1999 and 2000 transitioned to their post-level guaranteed premium rate period, we have experienced lower persistency compared to our pricing and valuation assumptions which accelerated DAC amortization in previous years. In addition, as our large 20-year level premium period business written in 1999 entered its post-level period, we experienced higher lapses resulting in accelerated DAC amortization in 2019. This trend continued in the first\nquarter of 2020 for the 1999 block, as it reached the end of its level premium period. Additionally, we have experienced a similar trend with the 20-year level premium period business written in 2000 as it entered its post-level period during 2020 and we expect that trend to continue in 2021 albeit to a lesser extent. In the future, as additional 10-,\nand 20-year\nlevel premium period blocks enter their post-level guaranteed premium rate period, we expect to experience volatility in DAC amortization, premiums and mortality experience, which we expect to reduce profitability in our term life insurance products, in amounts that could be material, if persistency is lower than our original assumptions. For additional information on our term life insurance reserves, including select sensitivities, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Insurance liabilities and reserves.\u201d\nAlthough some of our products permit us to increase premiums during the life of the policy or contract, we cannot guarantee that these increases would be sufficient to maintain profitability or that such increases would be approved by regulators or approved in a timely manner, where approval is required, and even if implemented the premium increases may result in higher lapses. Moreover, many of our products either do not permit us to increase premiums or limit those increases during the life of the policy or contract. Significant deviations in experience from pricing expectations could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products. In addition to our annual reviews, we regularly review our methodologies and assumptions in light of emerging experience and may be required to make further adjustments to reserves in our long-term care insurance, life insurance and/or annuities businesses in the future. Any changes to these reserves may have a materially negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nLoss recognition testing\nWe annually perform loss recognition testing for the liability for future policy benefits. Our loss recognition testing for our long-term care insurance products is reviewed in the aggregate, excluding our acquired block of long-term care insurance, which is tested separately. Our long-term care insurance business, excluding the acquired block, has positive margin which is highly dependent on the assumptions we have regarding our ability to successfully implement our in-force\nmanagement strategy involving premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions. We include future in-force\nrate actions in our loss recognition testing which includes assumptions for significant premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions that have been approved or are anticipated to be approved (including premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions not yet filed). A change in the expected amount of premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions would impact the results of our long-term care insurance margin testing, whereby any unexpected reduction in the amount of future in-force\nrate actions would negatively impact our margins and could result in a premium deficiency which would have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, capital levels, RBC and financial condition. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for the future in-force\nrate actions we have assumed in connection with our loss recognition testing. Favorable impacts on our margin from in-force\nrate actions would primarily impact our long-term care insurance block, excluding the acquired block. Due to the age of our acquired block, it would not benefit as significantly from future in-force\nrate actions. For our acquired block of long-term care insurance, the impacts of any adverse changes in assumptions are likely to be recorded as a loss as our margin for this block has been zero in the past.\nThe assumptions in our long-term care insurance products are sensitive to slight variability in actual experience and small changes in assumptions could result in the margin of our long-term care insurance block, excluding the acquired block, to decrease to at/or below zero in future years. Based on our reviews, if our margin is negative, we would be required to recognize a loss by amortizing more DAC and/or establishing additional benefit reserves, the impact of which may be material. A significant decrease in our loss recognition testing margin, the need to amortize a significant amount of DAC and/or the need to significantly increase reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For additional information on our long-term care insurance reserves, including select sensitivities, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Insurance liabilities and reserves.\u201d\nAs part of our annual loss recognition testing in our long-term care insurance products, we also review assumptions for incidence, claim severity, interest rates and in-force\nrate actions, among other assumptions. We regularly review our methodologies and assumptions in light of emerging experience and may be required to make further adjustments to our long-term care insurance claim reserves in the future, which could also impact our loss recognition testing results.\nSimilar to our long-term care insurance products, we annually perform loss recognition testing for our term and whole life insurance products in the aggregate, excluding our acquired block, which is tested separately. The margin of our term and whole life insurance products has fluctuated over the years. Any adverse changes in our assumptions could negatively impact the combined margin of our term and whole life insurance products. To the extent, based on reviews, our margin is negative for our term and whole life insurance products, excluding our acquired block, or our acquired block of term and whole life insurance products, we would be required to recognize a loss by amortizing more DAC and/or present value of future profits (\u201cPVFP\u201d) as well as the establishment of additional future policy benefit reserves if the DAC and/or PVFP was fully written off. A significant decrease in our loss recognition testing margin, the need to amortize a significant amount of DAC and/or PVFP or the need to significantly increase reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For additional information on our term life insurance reserves, including select sensitivities, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Insurance liabilities and reserves.\u201d\nWe will continue to monitor our experience and assumptions closely and make changes to our assumptions and methodologies, as appropriate, for our U.S. life insurance products. As experience has emerged in the past, we have made resulting changes to our assumptions that have had a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Our experience will continue to emerge and it is likely that future assumption reviews will result in further updates.\nCash flow testing\nWe also perform cash flow testing or \u201casset adequacy analysis\u201d separately for each of our U.S. life insurance companies on a statutory accounting basis. To the extent that the cash flow testing margin is negative in any of our U.S. life insurance companies, we would need to increase statutory reserves in that company, which would decrease our RBC ratios.\nAs a part of our cash flow testing process for our life insurance subsidiaries, we consider incremental benefits from expected future in-force\nrate actions in our long-term care insurance products that would help mitigate the impact of deteriorating experience. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for the future in-force\nrate actions we assumed in connection with our cash flow testing for our life insurance subsidiaries. A need to significantly further increase statutory reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe NYDFS, which regulates GLICNY, our New York insurance subsidiary, also requires specific adequacy testing scenarios that are generally more severe than those deemed acceptable in other states. Moreover, the required testing scenarios by the NYDFS have a disproportionate impact on our long-term care insurance products. In addition, we have historically used nationwide experience for setting assumptions in our long-term care insurance products in cash flow testing for all of our legal entities, including GLICNY.\nHowever, we have been monitoring emerging experience with our New York policyholders, which experience has been adverse as compared to our nationwide experience. With the benefit of additional data and analysis, and based on discussions with the NYDFS, we are using assumptions that reflect New York specific experience in GLICNY\u2019s asset adequacy analysis in 2020. After discussions with the NYDFS and through the exercise of professional actuarial judgment, GLICNY also incorporated in its 2020 asset adequacy analysis assumptions for future in-force\nrate actions for long-term care insurance products to offset the emerging\nadverse experience for these products. With these assumption updates, GLICNY\u2019s 2020 asset adequacy analysis produced a negative margin. To address the negative margin, GLICNY recorded an incremental $100 million of additional statutory reserves in 2020. This resulted in a 200% RBC for GLICNY in 2020, a decrease of 91 RBC points from 2019. For additional information on GLICNY asset adequacy testing, see note 17 in our consolidated financial statements under \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nSignificant adverse assumption changes could result in the cash flow testing margin in GLICNY to decrease to at/or below zero in future years. In addition, the NYDFS annually informs the industry that it does not permit in-force\nrate increases for long-term care insurance to be used in asset adequacy analysis until such increases have been approved. However, the NYDFS has allowed GLICNY to incorporate recently filed in-force\nrate actions in its asset adequacy analysis prior to approval in the past and, in 2020, allowed GLICNY to incorporate assumptions for future in-force\nrate actions in its asset adequacy analysis. If the NYDFS no longer allows GLICNY to incorporate assumptions for future in-force\nrate actions in its asset adequacy analysis to offset New York specific experience, this would result in a material decrease in GLICNY\u2019s cash flow testing margin and would require GLICNY to significantly increase its statutory reserves further. This would have a material adverse effect on GLICNY\u2019s financial condition and RBC ratio.\nFor additional information regarding impacts to statutory capital as a result of reserve increases, see \u201c-An adverse change in our regulatory requirements, including risk-based capital, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\u201d\nWe may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and the present value of future profits, which would increase our expenses and reduce profitability.\nDAC represents costs related to the successful acquisition of our insurance policies and investment contracts, which are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies and investment contracts. These costs primarily consist of commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions and underwriting and contract and policy issuance expenses incurred on policies and contracts successfully acquired. Under U.S. GAAP, DAC is subsequently amortized to income, over the lives of the underlying contracts, in relation to the anticipated recognition of premiums or gross profits. In addition, when we acquire a block of insurance policies or investment contracts, we assign a portion of the purchase price to the right to receive future net cash flows from the acquired block of insurance and investment contracts and policies. This intangible asset, called PVFP, represents the actuarially estimated present value of future cash flows from the acquired policies. We amortize the value of this intangible asset in a manner similar to the amortization of DAC.\nOur amortization of DAC and PVFP generally depends upon, among other items, anticipated profits from investments, surrender and other policy and contract charges, mortality, morbidity and maintenance expense margins. Unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses, investment returns, mortality, morbidity, withdrawals or lapses may cause us to increase the amortization of DAC or PVFP, or both, or to record a charge to increase benefit reserves, and such increases could be material. For additional information regarding impacts to DAC as a result of lapses of our term life insurance products, see \u201c-We may be required to increase our reserves in our long-term care insurance, life insurance and/or annuity businesses as a result of deviations from our estimates and actuarial assumptions or other reasons, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nWe regularly review DAC and PVFP to determine if they are recoverable from future income. If these costs are not recoverable, they are charged as expenses in the financial period in which we make this determination. If we determine that we are unable to recover DAC from profits over the life of a block of insurance policies or annuity contracts, or if withdrawals or surrender charges associated with early withdrawals do not fully offset the unamortized acquisition costs related to those policies or annuities, we would be required to recognize the additional DAC amortization as an expense in the current period. For example, in 2020, we recorded a DAC impairment of $63 million in our universal life insurance products due principally to lower future estimated gross\nprofits. Equity market volatility could result in losses in our variable annuity products and associated hedging programs which could challenge our ability to recover DAC on these products and could lead to further write-offs of DAC.\nFor additional information on DAC and PVFP, including the financial impact of some of these risks, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates\u201d and notes 6 and 7 in our consolidated financial statements under \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nWhen we have projected profits in earlier years followed by projected losses in later years (as is currently the case with our long-term care insurance business), we are required to increase our reserve liabilities over time to offset the projected future losses, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe calculate and maintain reserves for estimated future payments of claims to our policyholders and contractholders in accordance with U.S. GAAP and industry accounting practices. When we conclude that our reserves are insufficient by line of business to cover actual or expected policy and contract benefits and claim payments as a result of changes in experience, assumptions or otherwise, we are required to increase our reserves and incur charges in the period in which we make the determination. For certain long-duration products in our U.S. Life Insurance segment, we are also required to accrue additional reserves over time when the overall reserve is adequate by line of business, but profits are projected in earlier years followed by losses projected in later years. When this pattern of profits followed by losses exists for these products, and we determine that an additional reserve liability is required, we increase reserves in the years we expect to be profitable by the amounts necessary to offset losses projected in later years.\nIn our long-term care insurance products, projected profits followed by projected losses are anticipated to occur because U.S. GAAP requires that original assumptions be used in determining reserves for future policy claims unless and until a premium deficiency exists. Our existing locked-in\nreserve assumptions do not include assumptions for premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions, which if included in reserves, could reduce or eliminate future projected losses. As a result of this pattern of projected profits followed by projected losses, we are required to accrue additional future policy benefit reserves in the profitable years, currently expected to be through 2031, by the amounts necessary to offset losses in later years. The accrual is recorded on a quarterly basis using assumptions which are updated annually at the time we perform loss recognition testing and is impacted by the reserve pattern and the present value of expected future losses. Likewise, the accrual is subject to significant estimation and includes various assumptions that are sensitive to variability; small changes in assumptions could result in volatility of the accrued amount in any given year. Moreover, the amount required to accrue for additional future policy benefits in the profitable years may be significant and this could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For additional information, including the financial impact of some of these risks, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Future policy benefits.\u201d\nOur valuation of fixed maturity, equity and trading securities uses methodologies, estimations and assumptions that are subject to change and differing interpretations which could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe report fixed maturity, equity and trading securities at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. These securities represent the majority of our total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and invested assets. Our portfolio of fixed maturity securities consists primarily of investment grade securities. Valuations use inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation, as well as valuation methods that are more complex or require greater estimation, thereby resulting in values that are less certain and may vary significantly from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. The methodologies, estimates and assumptions\nwe use in valuing our investment securities evolve over time and are subject to different interpretation (including based on developments in relevant accounting literature), all of which can lead to changes in the value of our investment securities. Rapidly changing and unanticipated interest rate, external macroeconomic, credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of investment securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements, and the period-to-period\nchanges in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nLiquidity, Financial Strength and Credit Ratings, and Counterparty and Credit Risks\nOur internal sources of liquidity may be insufficient to meet our needs and our access to capital may be limited or unavailable. Under such conditions, we may seek additional capital but may be unable to obtain it.\nWe need liquidity to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt, maturing debt and other obligations and to meet any statutory capital requirements of our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, Genworth Holdings had approximately $2.7 billion of outstanding debt that matures between 2021 and 2066, including $0.3 billion that matured in February 2021 and $0.7 billion that matures in September 2021. In addition, we have a promissory note of approximately $0.6 billion due in 2022 to AXA associated with a settlement agreement reached in July 2020 reported as discontinued operations. The settlement agreement also requires that certain cash flows to Genworth Holdings above certain defined thresholds, including dividends and capital raises, would be paid to AXA until the promissory note is fully repaid. The settlement agreement places significant constraints on our ability to repay debt with the proceeds of new debt financing, equity offerings, asset sales or dividends from subsidiaries until the final settlement is repaid to AXA. This could significantly reduce our ability to raise capital which would adversely impact our liquidity. To date in 2021 and over the next year, we expect to pay AXA approximately $53 million consisting of interest on the promissory note, assuming we do not make any pre-payments,\nand a one-time\npayment on an unrelated liability associated with underwriting losses on a product sold by a distributor in our former lifestyle protection insurance business. See notes 20 and 23 in \u201cPart II-Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional details.\nOur existing cash resources are not sufficient to repay all outstanding debt as it becomes due. Furthermore, absent accessing additional liquidity through third party sources, we would not have a projected ability to meet our financial obligations with existing cash on hand and from expected cash inflows through normal business course for one year following the issuance of our 2020 consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we will be required to rely on a combination of other potential liquidity sources to repay or refinance debt and meet our financial obligations as they become due, including existing and future cash resources, new borrowings, and/or other potential sources of liquidity such as asset sales, including our mortgage insurance business in Australia and/or a possible partial initial public offering of our U.S. mortgage insurance business, or issuing additional debt or equity, including the issuance of convertible or equity-linked securities. The availability of additional funding, including an equity transaction through our U.S. mortgage insurance business or the issuance of debt, convertible or equity-linked securities, will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, regulatory considerations, the general availability of credit, the level of activity and availability of reinsurance, our credit ratings and credit capacity and the performance of and outlook for our U.S. mortgage insurance business. Market conditions and a variety of other factors may make it difficult or impracticable to generate additional liquidity on favorable terms or at all. In addition, even if we are successful with additional strategic asset sales or other transactions, we could have potential adverse actions taken against us, including litigation. Any failure to repay or refinance our debt or meet our financial obligations as they become due would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to raise capital and/or borrowings on favorable terms or at all, based on our credit ratings and financial condition. There is no guarantee that any of these factors will improve in the future when we would seek additional capital. Disruptions, volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets and downgrades in\nour credit ratings may force us to delay raising capital, issue shorter term securities than would be optimal, bear an unattractive cost of capital or be unable to raise capital at any price.\nWe do not currently have a revolving credit facility at the Genworth Holdings level to provide liquidity. To the extent we need additional funding to satisfy our additional liquidity needs, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into a new credit facility on terms (or at targeted amounts) acceptable to us or at all.\nSimilarly, market conditions and a variety of other factors may make it difficult or impracticable to generate additional liquidity through asset sales or the issuance of additional equity, and any issuance of equity in such circumstances could be highly dilutive to our stockholders.\nFor a further discussion of our liquidity, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nAs holding companies, we and Genworth Holdings depend on the ability of our respective subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments and distributions to each of us and to meet our obligations.\nWe and Genworth Holdings each act as a holding company for our respective subsidiaries and do not have any significant operations of our own. Dividends from our respective subsidiaries, permitted payments to us under tax sharing and expense reimbursement arrangements with our subsidiaries and proceeds from borrowings are our principal sources of cash to meet our obligations. These obligations include operating expenses, interest and principal payments on current and future borrowings, and a promissory note due to AXA reported as discontinued operations. See note 23 in \u201cPart II-Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional details. If the cash we receive from our respective subsidiaries pursuant to dividends and tax sharing and expense reimbursement arrangements is insufficient to fund any of these obligations, or if a subsidiary is unable or unwilling for any reason to pay dividends to either of us, we or Genworth Holdings would be required to raise cash through, among other things, the incurrence of debt (including convertible or exchangeable debt), the sale of assets or the issuance of equity.\nThe payment of dividends and other distributions by our insurance subsidiaries is dependent on, among other things, the performance of the subsidiaries, capital preservation as a result of the uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID-19,\ncorporate law restrictions, insurance laws and regulations and maintaining adequate capital to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs, including recent restrictions imposed by the GSEs on our U.S. mortgage insurance business. See \u201c-If we are unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs because the GSEs amend them or the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the financial requirements requires us to hold amounts of capital that are higher than we have planned or otherwise, we may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition\u201d and \u201cRegulation-Mortgage Insurance Regulation\u201d for additional details. In general, dividends in excess of prescribed limits are deemed \u201cextraordinary\u201d and require insurance regulatory approval. In addition, insurance regulators may prohibit the payment of ordinary dividends or other payments by the insurance subsidiaries (such as a payment under a tax sharing agreement or for employee or other services, including expense reimbursements) if they determine that such payment could be adverse to policyholders or contractholders. Moreover, regulators that have governance over our Australian mortgage insurance subsidiaries may impose additional restrictions over such subsidiaries using the broad prudential authorities available to them. Courts typically grant regulators significant deference when considering challenges of an insurance company to a determination by insurance regulators to grant or withhold approvals with respect to dividends and other distributions.\nOur liquidity and capital positions are highly dependent on the performance of our mortgage insurance subsidiaries and their ability to pay future dividends to us as anticipated. Given the performance of our U.S. life insurance businesses, dividends will not be paid by these businesses for the foreseeable future. The evaluation of future dividend sources, including determining which businesses will provide such dividends, and our overall\nliquidity plans are subject to current and future market conditions and the economic recovery from COVID-19,\namong other factors, which are subject to change.\nIn addition, as a public company that is traded on the ASX, Genworth Australia and its subsidiaries are subject to Australian securities laws and regulations, as well as the rules of the ASX. These applicable laws, regulations and rules include but are not limited to, obligations and procedures in respect of the equal and fair treatment of all shareholders of Genworth Australia. Although the board of directors of Genworth Australia is currently composed of a majority of Genworth designated directors, under Australian law each director has an obligation to exercise their powers and discharge their duties in good faith in the best interests of Genworth Australia and for a proper purpose. Accordingly, actions taken by Genworth Australia and its board of directors (including the payment of dividends to us) are subject to, and may be limited by, the laws, rules and regulations of the entity.\nAdverse rating agency actions have resulted in a loss of business and adversely affected our results of operations, financial condition and business and future adverse rating actions could have a further and more significant adverse impact on us.\nFinancial strength ratings, which various rating agencies publish as measures of an insurance company\u2019s ability to meet contractholder and policyholder obligations, are important to maintaining public confidence in our products, the ability to market our products and our competitive position. Credit ratings, which rating agencies publish as measures of an entity\u2019s ability to repay its indebtedness, are important to our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt and other forms of credit and to the cost of such financing.\nOver the last several years, the ratings of our holding companies and all of our insurance subsidiaries, have been downgraded, placed on negative outlook and/or put on review for potential downgrade on various occasions. A ratings downgrade, negative outlook or review could occur (and has occurred) for a variety of reasons, including reasons specifically related to our company, generally related to our industry or the broader financial services industry or as a result of changes by the rating agencies in their methodologies or rating criteria. We may be at risk of additional ratings downgrades in the future. A negative outlook on our ratings or a downgrade in any of our financial strength or credit ratings, the announcement of a potential downgrade, negative outlook or review, or customer, investor, regulator or other concerns about the possibility of a downgrade, negative outlook or review, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nSee \u201cItem 1 - Business-Ratings\u201d for information regarding the current financial strength ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries.\nThe direct or indirect effects of such adverse ratings actions or any future actions could include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nceasing and/or reducing new sales of our products or limiting the business opportunities we are presented with;\n\u2022\nadversely affecting our relationships with distributors, including the loss of exclusivity under certain agreements with our independent sales intermediaries and distribution partners;\n\u2022\ncausing us to lose key distributors that have ratings requirements that we may no longer satisfy (or resulting in our renegotiation of new, less favorable arrangements with those distributors);\n\u2022\nrequiring us to modify some of our existing products or services to remain competitive, or introduce new products or services;\n\u2022\nmaterially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders, withdrawals and loans by contractholders and policyholders;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to post additional collateral for our derivatives or hedging agreements tied to the credit ratings of our holding companies;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to provide support, or to arrange for third-party support, in the form of collateral, capital contributions or letters of credit under the terms of certain of our reinsurance, securitization and other agreements, or otherwise securing our commercial counterparties for the perceived risk of our financial strength;\n\u2022\nadversely affecting our ability to maintain reinsurance or obtain new reinsurance or obtain it on reasonable pricing and other terms;\n\u2022\nincreasing the capital charge associated with affiliated investments within certain of our U.S. life insurance businesses thereby lowering capital and RBC of these subsidiaries and negatively impacting our financial flexibility;\n\u2022\nregulators requiring certain of our subsidiaries to maintain additional capital, limiting thereby our financial flexibility and requiring us to raise additional capital;\n\u2022\nadversely affecting our ability to raise capital;\n\u2022\nincreasing our cost of borrowing and making it more difficult to borrow in the public debt markets or enter into a credit agreement; and\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult to execute strategic plans to effectively address our current business challenges.\nUnder PMIERs, the GSEs require maintenance of at least one rating with a rating agency acceptable to the respective GSEs. The current PMIERs do not include a specific ratings requirement with respect to eligibility, but if this were to change in the future, we may become subject to a ratings requirement in order to retain our eligibility status under PMIERs. Ratings downgrades that result in our inability to insure new mortgage loans sold to the GSEs, or the transfer by the GSEs of our existing policies to an alternative mortgage insurer, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See \u201c-If we are unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs because the GSEs amend them or the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the financial requirements requires us to hold amounts of capital that are higher than we have planned or otherwise, we may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition\u201d for additional information regarding the requirements under PMIERs. Our relationships with our mortgage insurance customers may be adversely affected by the ratings assigned to our holding company or other operating subsidiaries which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, our U.S. mortgage insurance business has financial strength ratings below its competitors. Any assigned financial strength rating that remains below other private mortgage insurers could hinder our competitiveness in the marketplace and could result in an adverse impact to our business. Moreover, any future downgrade in the financial strength ratings of our U.S. mortgage insurance business or the announcement of a potential downgrade could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nDefaults by counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements or to derivative instruments we use to hedge our business risks, or defaults by us on agreements we have with these counterparties, may expose us to risks we sought to mitigate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe routinely execute reinsurance and derivative transactions with reinsurers, brokers/dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional counterparties to mitigate our risks in various circumstances and to hedge various business risks. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client or change in collateral value. Reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders, even when the reinsurer is liable to us. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our\nreinsurers. We cannot be sure that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverable owed to us now or in the future or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis. A reinsurer\u2019s insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Collateral is often posted by the counterparty to offset this risk; however, we bear the risk that the collateral declines in value or otherwise is inadequate to fully compensate us in the event of a default. We also enter into a variety of derivative instruments, including options, swaps, forwards, and interest rate and currency swaps with a number of counterparties. If our counterparties fail or refuse to honor their obligations under the derivative instruments, and collateral posted, if any, is inadequate, our hedges of the related risk will be ineffective. In addition, if we trigger downgrade provisions on risk-hedging or reinsurance arrangements, the counterparties to these arrangements may be able to terminate our arrangements with them or require us to take other measures, such as post additional collateral, contribute capital or provide letters of credit. We have agreed to new terms with almost all of our counterparties concerning our collateral arrangements given our ratings decline. In most cases, we have agreed to post excess collateral to maintain our existing derivative agreements. Beginning in 2018, we renegotiated with many of our counterparties to remove the credit downgrade provisions from the master swap agreements entirely or replace them with a provision that allows the counterparty to terminate the derivative transaction if the RBC ratio of the applicable insurance company goes below a certain threshold. In 2019, we successfully completed these negotiations and as a result, none of our insurance company master swap agreements have credit downgrade provisions. Although we believe this has allowed us to maintain effective hedging relationships with our counterparties, it has added additional strain on liquidity and collateral sufficiency. Furthermore, there is no assurance that we can maintain these current arrangements in the foreseeable future or at all. If counterparties exercise their rights to terminate transactions, we may be required to make cash payments to the counterparty based on the current contract value, which would hinder our ability to manage future risks.\nWe ceded to UFLIC our in-force\nstructured settlements block of business issued prior to 2004, certain variable annuity business issued prior to 2004 and the long-term care insurance business assumed from legal entities now a part of Brighthouse Life Insurance Company. UFLIC has established trust accounts for our benefit to secure its obligations under the reinsurance arrangements. GE is obligated to maintain UFLIC\u2019s RBC above a specified minimum level pursuant to a Capital Maintenance Agreement. If UFLIC becomes insolvent notwithstanding this agreement, and the amounts in the trust accounts are insufficient to pay UFLIC\u2019s obligations to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The loss of material risk-hedging or reinsurance arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For additional information on UFLIC reinsurance, see note 8 in our consolidated financial statements under \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nDefaults or other events impacting the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio may reduce our income.\nWe are subject to the risk that the issuers or guarantors of investment securities we own may default on principal or interest payments they owe us. As of December 31, 2020, fixed maturity securities of $65.8 billion in our investment portfolio represented 82% of our total cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and invested assets. Events reducing the value of our investment portfolio other than on a temporary basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Levels of write-downs or expected credit losses are impacted by our assessment of the financial condition of the issuer, whether or not the issuer is expected to pay its principal and interest obligations, our expected recoveries in the event of a default or circumstances that would require us to sell securities which have declined in value.\nRisks Relating to Economic, Market and Political Conditions\nInterest rates and changes in rates could materially adversely affect our business and profitability.\nOur products and investment portfolio are impacted by interest rate fluctuations and/or a sustained period of low interest rates. In recent years, historic low interest rates have adversely impacted our business and\nprofitability. For example, as part of our annual review of assumptions for our universal and term universal life insurance products, we increased the liability for policyholder account balances in 2019 and 2018 as a result of lower expected growth in interest rates and a prolonged low interest rate environment. For additional information, including the historical financial impact of these updates, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Policyholder account balances.\u201d Persistent low interest rates have also adversely impacted the margins of our fixed immediate annuity products. In 2019 and 2018, we performed loss recognition testing and determined that we had premium deficiencies in our fixed immediate annuity products primarily driven by the low interest rate environment. For additional information, including the historical financial impact of the premium deficiencies, see \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates-Future policy benefits.\u201d Sustained low interest rates also impacted our long-term care insurance margin, which is sensitive to assumption changes, including future investment returns. If interest rates remain at historic lows, our future profitability and business would be adversely impacted.\nOur insurance and investment products are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations and expose us to the risk that declines in interest rates or tightening credit spreads will reduce our interest rate margin (the difference between the returns we earn on the investments that support our obligations under these products and the amounts that we pay to policyholders and contractholders). We may reduce the interest rates we credit on most of these products only at limited, pre-established\nintervals, and some contracts have guaranteed minimum interest crediting rates. As a result of recent historic low interest rates, declines in our interest rate margin on these products have adversely impacted our business and profitability.\nDuring periods of increasing market interest rates, we may increase crediting rates on interest-sensitive in-force\nproducts, such as universal life insurance and fixed annuities. Rapidly rising interest rates may lead to increased policy surrenders, withdrawals from life insurance policies and annuity contracts and requests for policy loans, as policyholders and contractholders shift assets into higher yielding investments. Increases in crediting rates, as well as surrenders and withdrawals, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including the requirement to liquidate fixed-income investments in an unrealized loss position to satisfy surrenders or withdrawals.\nIn our U.S. mortgage insurance business, declining interest rates historically have increased the rate at which borrowers refinance their existing mortgages, resulting in cancellations of the mortgage insurance covering the refinanced loans. Declining interest rates have also contributed to home price appreciation, which may provide borrowers in the United States with the option of cancelling their mortgage insurance coverage earlier than we anticipated when pricing that coverage. In addition, during 2020 as a result of the low interest rate environment, our U.S. mortgage insurance business experienced a decline in persistency rates. Lower persistency rates result in reduced insurance in-force\nand earned premiums, which could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations. See \u201c-A decrease in the volume of high loan-to-value\nhome mortgage originations or an increase in the volume of mortgage insurance cancellations could result in a decline in our revenue in our mortgage insurance businesses.\u201d\nIn both the United States and international mortgage markets, rising interest rates generally reduce the volume of new mortgage originations. A decline in the volume of new mortgage originations would have an adverse effect on our new insurance written. Rising interest rates also can increase the monthly mortgage payments for homeowners with insured loans that have adjustable rate mortgages (\u201cARMs\u201d) that could have the effect of increasing default rates on ARM loans, thereby increasing our exposure on our mortgage insurance policies. This is particularly relevant in our Australia mortgage insurance business where ARMs and shorter-term fixed rate loans are the predominant mortgage products. Higher interest rates can lead to an increase in defaults as borrowers at risk of default will find it harder to qualify for a replacement loan.\nInterest rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our investment portfolio, by increasing reinvestment risk and reducing our ability to achieve adequate investment returns. During periods of declining\nmarket interest rates, the interest we receive on variable interest rate investments decreases. In addition, during those periods, we reinvest the cash we receive as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower-yielding high-grade instruments or in lower-credit instruments to maintain comparable returns. Issuers of fixed-income securities may decide to prepay their obligations in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates our reinvestment risk. Low interest rates reduce the returns we earn on the investments that support our obligations under long-term care insurance, life insurance and annuity products, which increases reinvestment risk and reduces our ability to achieve our targeted investment returns. The pricing and expected future profitability of these products are based in part on expected investment returns. Generally, life and long-term care insurance products are expected to initially produce positive cash flows as customers pay periodic premiums, which we invest as they are received. The premiums, along with accumulated investment earnings, are needed to pay claims, which are generally expected to exceed premiums in later years. Low interest rates increase reinvestment risk and reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins and adversely affects the profitability of our life insurance, long-term care insurance and fixed annuity products and may increase hedging costs on our in-force\nblock of variable annuity products. Given the average life of our assets is shorter than the average life of the liabilities on these products, our reinvestment risk is also greater in low interest rate environments as a significant portion of cash flows used to pay benefits to our policyholders and contractholders comes from investment returns. During periods of increasing interest rates, market values of lower-yielding assets will decline resulting in unrealized losses on our investment portfolio. In addition, our interest rate hedges could decline which would require us to post additional collateral with our derivative counterparties. Posting additional collateral could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations by reducing our liquidity and net investment income, to the extent that the additional collateral posting requires us to invest in higher-quality, lower-yielding investments.\nA low interest rate environment also negatively impacts the sufficiency of our margins on both our DAC and PVFP. If interest rates remain at historic lows for a prolonged period, it could result in an impairment of these assets, and may reduce funds available to pay claims, including life and long-term care insurance claims, requiring an increase in our reserve liabilities, which could be significant. In addition, certain statutory capital requirements for our U.S. life insurance companies are based on models that consider interest rates. Prolonged periods of low interest rates may increase the statutory reserves we are required to hold as well as the amount of assets and capital we must maintain to support amounts of statutory reserves in these companies. Interest rate fluctuations could also impact our capital or solvency ratios in our Australia mortgage insurance business where the required or available capital could be adversely impacted by increases in interest rates.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced its intention to transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), with its full elimination to occur after 2021. The announcement indicates that LIBOR may not continue to be available on the current basis (or at all) after 2021. We have LIBOR-based derivative instruments and investments, as well as debt (Junior Subordinated Notes and Federal Home Loan Bank loans), reinsurance agreements and institutional products within the Runoff segment. Regulatory and industry initiatives to eliminate LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark may create uncertainty in the valuation of our LIBOR-based derivative instruments and investments. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate impact the elimination of LIBOR will have on financial markets, nor our investment and derivative valuations, hedge accounting, reinsurance agreements and liquidity; however, it is possible we may be unable to negotiate or amend our existing contracts with terms that are favorable to us which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cPart II-Item 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Investments and Derivative Instruments\u201d for additional information about the transition from LIBOR.\nSee \u201cPart II-Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for additional information about interest rate risk.\nA deterioration in economic conditions or a decline in home prices may adversely affect our loss experience in our mortgage insurance businesses.\nLosses in our mortgage insurance businesses generally result from events, such as a borrower\u2019s reduction of income, unemployment, underemployment, divorce, illness, inability to manage credit, or a change in interest rate levels or home values, that reduce a borrower\u2019s willingness or ability to continue to make mortgage payments. Rising unemployment rates and deteriorations in economic conditions, including as a result of COVID-19,\nincrease the likelihood of borrower defaults and can also adversely affect housing values, which increases our risk of loss. A decline in home values typically makes it more difficult for borrowers to sell or refinance their homes, increasing the likelihood of a default followed by a claim if borrowers experience a job loss or other life events that reduce their incomes or increase their expenses. In addition, declines in home values may also decrease the willingness of borrowers with sufficient resources to make mortgage payments when their mortgage balances exceed the values of their homes. Declines in home values typically increase the severity of any claims we may pay. A decline in home prices, whether or not in conjunction with deteriorating economic conditions, may increase our risk of loss. Furthermore, our estimates of claims-paying resources and claim obligations are based on various assumptions, which include the timing of the receipt of claims on loans in our delinquency inventory and future claims that we anticipate will ultimately be received, our anticipated loss mitigation activities, premiums, housing prices and unemployment rates. These assumptions are subject to inherent uncertainty and require judgment by management. Any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe amount of the loss we could suffer depends, in part, on whether the home of a borrower who defaults on a mortgage can be sold for an amount that will cover the unpaid principal balance, interest and the expenses of the sale. In previous economic slowdowns in the United States we experienced a pronounced weakness in the housing market, as well as declines in home prices. These economic slowdowns and the resulting impact on the housing market drove high levels of delinquencies. Any delays in foreclosure processes, including foreclosure moratoriums imposed by state and local governments due to COVID-19,\ncould cause our losses to increase as expenses accrue for longer periods or if the value of foreclosed homes further decline during such delays. If we experience an increase in the number or the cost of delinquencies that are higher than expected, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn the past, low commodity prices, particularly oil, have resulted in a rise in unemployment in countries and certain regions within those countries where we conduct business. The adverse economic conditions in these countries and certain regions within those countries could deteriorate like we have experienced in the past which could impact the broader economies in those countries as well as the global economy, resulting in higher delinquencies as well as declines in home prices, which could have an unfavorable impact on the results of our operations for those businesses affected.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nOur insurance businesses are extensively regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth.\nOur insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations and are extensively regulated. State insurance laws regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and licensed. Our international operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled. Failure to comply with applicable regulations or to obtain or maintain appropriate authorizations or exemptions under any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or engage in activities regulated in one or more jurisdictions in which we operate and could subject us to fines and other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the nature and extent of regulation of our activities in applicable jurisdictions could materially change causing a material adverse effect on our business.\nInsurance regulatory authorities in the United States and internationally have broad administrative powers, which at times, are coordinated and communicated across regulatory bodies. These administrative powers include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nlicensing companies and agents to transact business;\n\u2022\ncalculating the value of assets and determining the eligibility of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements;\n\u2022\nmandating certain insurance benefits;\n\u2022\nregulating certain premium rates;\n\u2022\nreviewing and approving policy forms;\n\u2022\nregulating discrimination in pricing and coverage terms and unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements;\n\u2022\nestablishing and revising statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards;\n\u2022\nfixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts;\n\u2022\napproving premium increases and associated benefit reductions;\n\u2022\nevaluating enterprise risk to an insurer;\n\u2022\napproving changes in control of insurance companies;\n\u2022\nrestricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates;\n\u2022\nregulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments;\n\u2022\nrestricting the types of insurance products that may be offered; and\n\u2022\nimposing insurance eligibility criteria.\nState insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine\nexisting laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to SAP, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Any proposed or future legislation or NAIC initiatives, if adopted, may be more restrictive on our ability to conduct business than current regulatory requirements or may result in higher costs or increased statutory capital and reserve requirements. Further, because laws and regulations can be complex and sometimes inexact, there is also a risk that any particular regulator\u2019s or enforcement authority\u2019s interpretation of a legal, accounting or reserving issue may change over time to our detriment, or expose us to different or additional regulatory risks. The application of these regulations and guidelines by insurers involves interpretations and judgments that may differ from those of state insurance departments. We cannot provide assurance that such differences of opinion will not result in regulatory, tax or other challenges to the actions we have taken to date. The result of those potential challenges could require us to increase levels of statutory capital and reserves or incur higher operating costs and/or have implications on certain tax positions.\nRegulators in the United States and internationally have developed criteria under which they are subjecting non-bank\nfinancial companies, including insurance companies, that are deemed systemically important to higher regulatory capital requirements and stricter prudential standards. Although neither we nor any of our subsidiaries have been designated systemically important, we cannot predict whether we or any of our subsidiaries will be deemed systemically important in the future or how such a designation would impact our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nLitigation and regulatory investigations or other actions are common in the insurance business and may result in financial losses and harm our reputation.\nWe face the risk of litigation and regulatory investigations or other actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses, including class action lawsuits. Our pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to us and others generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate.\nIn our insurance operations, we are, have been, or may become subject to class actions and individual suits alleging, among other things, issues relating to sales or underwriting practices, increases to in-force\nlong-term care and life insurance premiums, payment of contingent or other sales commissions, claims payments and procedures, cancellation or rescission of coverage, product design, product disclosure, product administration, additional premium charges for premiums paid on a periodic basis, denial or delay of benefits, charging excessive or impermissible fees on products, recommending unsuitable products to customers, our pricing structures and business practices in our mortgage insurance businesses, such as captive reinsurance arrangements with lenders and contract underwriting services, violations of RESPA or related state anti-inducement laws and breaching fiduciary or other duties to customers. In our investment-related operations, we are subject to litigation involving commercial disputes with counterparties. In addition, we are also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, subpoenas, books and record examinations and market conduct and financial examinations, from state, federal and international regulators and other authorities. Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us, as well as regulators, may seek very large or indeterminate amounts, which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time.\nWe are also subject to litigation arising out of our general business activities such as our contractual and employment relationships and we are also subject to shareholder putative class action lawsuits alleging securities law violations.\nA substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action (including uncertainty about the outcome of pending legal and regulatory investigations and actions) against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation, regulatory action or investigation, we could suffer significant reputational harm and incur significant legal expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. At this time, it is not feasible to predict, nor determine, the ultimate outcomes of any pending investigations and legal proceedings, nor to provide reasonable ranges of possible losses other than those that have been disclosed.\nFor a further discussion of certain current investigations and proceedings in which we are involved, see note 20 in \u201cPart II-Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d We cannot assure you that these investigations and proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, business, financial condition or results of operations. It is also possible that we could become subject to further investigations and have lawsuits filed or enforcement actions initiated against us. In addition, increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting investigations or legal proceedings could result in new legal precedents and industry-wide regulations or practices that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn adverse change in our regulatory requirements, including risk-based capital, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nOur U.S. life insurance subsidiaries are subject to the NAIC\u2019s RBC standards and other minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements imposed under the laws of their respective states of domicile. The failure of our insurance subsidiaries to meet applicable RBC requirements or minimum statutory capital and surplus requirements could subject our insurance subsidiaries to further examination or corrective action imposed by state insurance regulators, including limitations on their ability to write additional business, or the addition of state regulatory supervision, rehabilitation, seizure or liquidation. As of December 31, 2020, the RBC of each of\nour U.S. life insurance subsidiaries exceeded the level of RBC that would require any of them to take or become subject to any corrective action in their respective domiciliary state. However, the RBC ratio of our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries has declined over the past few years as a result of statutory losses driven by the declining performance of the business and increases in our statutory reserves, including results of Actuarial Guideline 38, cash flow testing and assumption reviews particularly in our long-term care and life insurance products. Any future statutory losses would decrease the RBC ratio of our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries. We continue to face challenges in our principal life insurance subsidiaries, particularly those subsidiaries that rely heavily on in-force\nrate actions as a source of earnings and capital. We may see variability in statutory results and a further decline in the RBC ratios of these subsidiaries given the time lag between the approval of in-force\nrate actions versus when the benefits from the in-force\nrate actions (including premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions) are fully realized in our financial results. Further declines in the RBC ratio of our life insurance subsidiaries could result in heightened supervision and regulatory action.\nOur U.S. mortgage insurers are not subject to the NAIC\u2019s RBC requirements but are required by certain states and other regulators to maintain a certain risk-to-capital\nratio. In addition, PMIERs includes financial requirements for mortgage insurers under which a mortgage insurer\u2019s \u201cAvailable Assets\u201d (generally only the most liquid assets of an insurer) must meet or exceed \u201cMinimum Required Assets\u201d (which are based on an insurer\u2019s risk-in-force\nand are calculated from tables of factors with several risk dimensions and are subject to a floor amount). The failure of our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries to meet their regulatory requirements, and additionally the PMIERs financial requirements, could limit our ability to write new business. For further discussion of the importance of financial requirements to our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries, see \u201c-If we are unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs because the GSEs amend them or the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the financial requirements requires us to hold amounts of capital that are higher than we have planned or otherwise, we may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition\u201d and \u201c-Our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum statutory capital requirements, which if not met or waived, would result in restrictions or prohibitions on our doing business and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\u201d\nA further adverse change in our RBC, risk-to-capital\nratio or other minimum regulatory requirements could cause rating agencies to further downgrade the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries and the credit ratings of Genworth Holdings, which would have an adverse impact on our ability to write and retain business, and could cause regulators to take regulatory or supervisory actions with respect to our businesses, limit the financial flexibility of our holding company, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nChanges to the role of the GSEs or to the charters or business practices of the GSEs, including actions or decisions to decrease or discontinue the use of mortgage insurance, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or significantly impact our business.\nThe requirements and practices of the GSEs impact the operating results and financial performance of approved mortgage insurers, including us. Changes in the charters or business practices of Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae could materially reduce the number of mortgages they purchase that are insured by us and consequently diminish the value of our business. The GSEs could be directed to make such changes by the FHFA, which was appointed as their conservator in September 2008 and has the authority to control and direct the operations of the GSEs.\nWith the GSEs in a prolonged conservatorship, there has been ongoing debate over the future role and purpose of the GSEs in the United States housing market. Congress may legislate, or the administration may implement through administrative reform, structural and other changes to the GSEs and the functioning of the secondary mortgage market. Since 2011, there have been numerous legislative proposals intended to incrementally scale back the GSEs (such as a statutory mandate for the GSEs to transfer mortgage credit risk to\nthe private sector) or to completely reform the United States housing finance system. Congress, however, has not enacted any legislation to date. Recently, there has been increased focus on and discussion of administrative reform independent of legislative action. The proposals vary with regard to the government\u2019s role in the housing market, and more specifically, with regard to the existence of an explicit or implicit government guarantee. If any GSE reform is adopted, whether through legislation or administrative action, it could impact the current role of private mortgage insurance as a credit enhancement, including its reduction or elimination, which would have an adverse effect on our revenue, business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of these matters, it is uncertain what role private capital, including mortgage insurance, will play in the U.S. residential housing finance system in the future or the impact any such changes could have on our business. Any changes to the charters or statutory authorities of the GSEs would likely require Congressional action to implement. Passage and timing of any comprehensive GSE reform or incremental change (legislative or administrative) is uncertain, making the actual impact on us and our industry difficult to predict. Any such changes that come to pass could have a significant impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn recent years, the FHFA has set goals for the GSEs to transfer significant portions of the GSE\u2019 mortgage credit risk to the private sector. This mandate builds upon the goals set in each of the last five years for the GSEs to increase the role of private capital by experimenting with different forms of transactions and structures. We have participated in credit risk transfer programs developed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on a limited basis. In 2018, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae announced the launch of limited pilot programs, Integrated Mortgage Insurance (\u201cIMAGIN\u201d) and Enterprise Paid Mortgage Insurance (\u201cEPMI\u201d), respectively, as alternative ways for lenders to sell to the GSEs loans with loan-to-value\nratios greater than 80%. These investor-paid mortgage insurance programs, in which insurance is acquired directly by each GSE, have many of the same features and represent an alternative to traditional private mortgage insurance products that are provided to individual lenders. Participants in IMAGIN and EPMI are not subject to compliance with the current PMIERs, which may create a competitive disadvantage for private mortgage insurers if these pilot programs are expanded. To the extent these credit risk products evolve in a manner that displaces primary mortgage insurance coverage, the amount of insurance we write may be reduced. It is difficult to predict the impact of alternative credit risk transfer products, if any, that are developed to meet the goals established by the FHFA. In addition, in December 2020, the FHFA published a final rule of its Enterprise Regulatory Capital Framework. The Enterprise Regulatory Capital Framework imposes a new capital framework on the GSEs, which significantly increases capital requirements and reduces capital credit on credit risk transfer transactions as compared to the previous framework. Although the Enterprise Regulatory Capital Framework will not be fully effective until the GSEs are released from conservatorship, the FHFA expects the GSEs to begin operating under relevant provisions beginning in February 2021. The final rule could cause the GSEs to increase their guarantee pricing in order to meet the new capital requirements. If the GSEs increase their guarantee pricing in order to meet the higher capital requirements, that increase could have a negative impact on the private mortgage insurance market and our business. Furthermore, higher GSE capital requirements could ultimately lead to increased costs to borrowers for GSE loans, which in turn could shift the market away from the GSEs to the FHA or lender portfolios. Such a shift could result in a smaller market size for private mortgage insurance. This rule could also accelerate the recent diversification of the GSE\u2019s risk transfer programs to encompass a broader array of instruments beyond private mortgage insurance which could adversely impact our business.\nFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae also possess substantial market power, which enables them to influence our U.S. mortgage insurance business and the mortgage insurance industry in general. Although we actively monitor and develop our relationships with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, a deterioration in any of these relationships, or the loss of business or opportunities for new business, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs because the GSEs amend them or the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the financial requirements requires us to hold amounts of capital that are higher than we have planned or otherwise, we may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn furtherance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s respective charter requirements, each GSE adopted PMIERs effective December 31, 2015. Amendments to PMIERs have occurred periodically since its inception. Most recently, in December 2020, the GSEs issued a revised and restated version of PMIERs that was effective on December 31, 2020. The PMIERs include financial requirements for mortgage insurers under which a mortgage insurer\u2019s \u201cAvailable Assets\u201d (generally only the most liquid assets of an insurer) must meet or exceed \u201cMinimum Required Assets\u201d (which are based on an insurer\u2019s risk-in-force\nand are calculated from tables of factors with several risk dimensions and are subject to a floor amount) and otherwise generally establish when a mortgage insurer is qualified to issue coverage that will be acceptable to the respective GSE for acquisition of high loan-to-value\nmortgages. The GSEs may amend or waive PMIERs at their discretion, impose additional conditions or restrictions on us, and also have broad discretion to interpret PMIERs, which could impact the calculation of our available assets and/or minimum required assets.\nThe amount of capital that may be required in the future to maintain the Minimum Required Assets, as defined in PMIERs, and operate our business is dependent upon, among other things: (i) the way PMIERs are applied and interpreted by the GSEs and FHFA as and after they are implemented; (ii) the future performance of the U.S. housing market, including as a result of COVID-19\nand the length and speed of recovery; (iii) our generation of earnings in our U.S. mortgage insurance business, available assets and risk-based required assets, reducing risk in-force\nand reducing delinquencies as anticipated, and writing anticipated amounts and types of new U.S. mortgage insurance business; and (iv) our overall financial performance, capital and liquidity levels. Depending on our actual experience, the amount of capital required under PMIERs for our U.S. mortgage insurance business may be higher than currently anticipated. In the absence of a premium increase, if we hold more capital relative to insured loans, our returns will be lower. We may be unable to increase premium rates for various reasons, principally due to competition. Our inability, on the other hand, to increase the capital as required in the anticipated timeframes and on the anticipated terms, and to realize the anticipated benefits, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. More particularly, our ability to continue to meet the PMIERs financial requirements and maintain a prudent amount of capital in excess of those requirements, given the dynamic nature of asset valuations and requirement changes over time, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) our ability to complete credit risk transfer transactions on our anticipated terms and timetable, which are subject to market conditions, third-party approvals and other actions (including approval by regulators and the GSEs), and other factors which are outside of our control; and (ii) our ability to contribute holding company cash or other sources of capital to satisfy the portion of the financial requirements that are not satisfied through these transactions. In addition, another potential capital source includes, but is not limited to, the issuance of securities by Genworth Financial, Genworth Holdings or GMHI, which could materially adversely impact our business, shareholders and debtholders.\nThe most recent PMIERs amendments included temporary capital preservation provisions effective through June 30, 2021, that require an approved insurer to obtain prior written GSE approval before paying any dividends, pledging or transferring assets to an affiliate or entering into any new, or altering any existing arrangements under tax sharing and intercompany expense-sharing agreements, even if such insurer has a surplus of available assets. These PMIERs amendments have restricted and may continue to restrict our U.S. mortgage insurance business from paying dividends to us. See \u201c-As holding companies, we and Genworth Holdings depend on the ability of our respective subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments and distributions to each of us and to meet our obligations.\u201d It is unclear what, if any, further actions the GSEs may take in the event COVID-19\nfinancial hardships continue into the middle half of 2021. If the temporary provisions of the PMIERs amendment are not extended to include new delinquencies occurring after April 1, 2021, or borrower forbearance plans are not extended beyond 15 months, it could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn September 2020, subsequent to the issuance of GMHIs senior notes, the GSEs imposed certain conditions and restrictions on our U.S. mortgage insurance business with respect to its capital. See \u201cRegulation-Mortgage Insurance Regulation\u201d for additional details. These additional conditions and restrictions imposed by the GSEs could limit the operating flexibility of our U.S. mortgage insurance business, particularly in the areas in which new business is written and may adversely impact its competitive position, its ability to meet and maintain compliance with the PMIERs requirements and Genworth\u2019s overall business. Moreover, it further restricts the ability of our U.S. mortgage insurance business to pay dividends and requires the retention of higher capital levels limiting the availability of capital to be utilized elsewhere in the business.\nOur assessment of PMIERs compliance is based on a number of factors, including affiliate asset valuations under PMIERs and our understanding of the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the PMIERs financial requirements. Although we believe we have sufficient capital in our U.S. mortgage insurance business as required under PMIERs and we remain an approved insurer, there can be no assurance these conditions will continue. In addition, there can be no assurance we will continue to meet the conditions contained in the GSE letters granting PMIERs credit for reinsurance and other credit risk transfer transactions including, but not limited to, our ability to remain below a statutory risk-to-capital\nratio of 18:1. The GSEs also reserve the right to reevaluate the credit for reinsurance and other credit risk transfer transactions available under PMIERs. If we are unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs, the GSE restrictions discussed above or any additional restrictions imposed on us by the GSEs, whether because the GSEs amend them or the GSE\u2019s interpretation of the financial requirements requires us to hold amounts of capital that are higher than we have planned or otherwise, we may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, compliance with PMIERs requires us to seek the GSEs\u2019 prior approval before taking many actions, including implementing certain new products or services or entering into inter-company agreements among others. PMIERs\u2019 prior approval requirements could prohibit, materially modify or delay us in our intended course of action. Further, the GSEs may modify or change their interpretation of terms they require us to include in our mortgage insurance coverage for loans purchased by them, requiring us to modify our terms of coverage or operational procedures to remain an approved insurer, and such changes could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and operating results. It is possible the GSEs could, at their own discretion, require additional limitations and/or conditions on certain of our activities and practices that are not currently in the PMIERs in order for us to remain an approved insurer. Additional requirements or conditions imposed by the GSEs could limit our operating flexibility and the areas in which we may write new business. Any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum statutory capital requirements, which if not met or waived, would result in restrictions or prohibitions on our doing business and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nCertain states have insurance laws or regulations which require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to its level of risk in-force.\nWhile formulations of minimum capital vary in certain states, the most common measure applied allows for a maximum permitted risk-to-capital\nratio of 25:1. If one of our U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiaries that is writing business in a particular state fails to maintain that state\u2019s required minimum capital level, we would generally be required to immediately stop writing new business in the state until the insurer re-establishes\nthe required level of capital or receives a waiver of the requirement from the state\u2019s insurance regulator, or until we establish an alternative source of underwriting capacity acceptable to the regulator. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, GMICO\u2019s risk-to-capital\nratio was approximately 12.3:1 and 12.5:1, respectively. If GMICO exceeds required risk-to-capital\nlevels in the future, we would seek required regulatory and GSE forbearance and approvals or seek approval for the utilization of alternative insurance vehicles. However, there can be no assurance if, and on what terms, such forbearance and approvals may be obtained.\nThe NAIC established the MGIWG to determine and make recommendations to the NAIC\u2019s Financial Condition Committee as to what, if any, changes to make to the solvency and other regulations relating to mortgage guaranty insurers. The MGIWG continues to work on revisions to the MGI Model. The proposed amendments of the MGI Model relate to, among other things: (i) capital and reserve standards, including increased minimum capital and surplus requirements, mortgage guaranty-specific RBC standards, dividend restrictions and contingency and premium deficiency reserves; (ii) limitations on the geographic concentration of mortgage guaranty risk, including state-based limitations; (iii) restrictions on mortgage insurers\u2019 investments in notes secured by mortgages; (iv) prudent underwriting standards and formal underwriting guidelines to be approved by the insurer\u2019s board; (v) the establishment of formal, internal \u201cMortgage Guaranty Quality Control Programs\u201d with respect to in-force\nbusiness; (vi) prohibitions on captive reinsurance arrangements; and (vii) incorporation of an NAIC \u201cMortgage Guaranty Insurance Standards Manual.\u201d The MGIWG is also working on the development of the mortgage guaranty insurance capital model, which is needed to determine the RBC and loan-level capital standards for the amended MGI Model. At this time, we cannot predict the outcome of this process, the effect changes, if any, will have on the mortgage guaranty insurance market generally, or on our businesses specifically, the additional costs associated with compliance with any such changes, or any changes to our operations that may be necessary to comply, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We also cannot predict whether other regulatory initiatives will be adopted or what impact, if any, such initiatives, if adopted as laws, may have on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nChanges in regulations that adversely affect the mortgage insurance markets in which we operate could affect our operations significantly and could reduce the demand for mortgage insurance.\nIn addition to the general regulatory risks that are described under \u201c-Our insurance businesses are extensively regulated and changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth,\u201d we are also affected by various additional regulations relating particularly to our mortgage insurance operations.\nUnited States\nIn the United States, federal and state regulations affect the scope of our U.S. competitors\u2019 operations, which has an effect on the size of the U.S. mortgage insurance market and the intensity of the competition in our U.S. mortgage insurance business. This competition includes not only other private mortgage insurers, but also U.S. federal and state governmental and quasi-governmental agencies, principally the FHA and the VA, which are governed by federal regulations. Increases in the maximum loan amount that the FHA can insure, and reductions in the mortgage insurance premiums the FHA charges, can reduce the demand for private mortgage insurance. Decreases in the maximum loan amounts the GSEs will purchase or guarantee, increases in GSE fees or decreases in the maximum loan-to-value\nratio for loans the GSEs will purchase can also reduce demand for private mortgage insurance. Legislative, regulatory or administrative changes could cause demand for private mortgage insurance to decrease. In addition, there is uncertainty surrounding the implementation of the Basel framework and whether its rules will be implemented in the United States. It is possible that its implementation could occur in the United States and its rules could discourage the use of mortgage insurance. See \u201c-Basel Framework\u201d below for further details.\nOur U.S. mortgage insurance business, as a credit enhancement provider in the residential mortgage lending industry, is also subject to compliance with various federal and state consumer protection and insurance laws, including RESPA, the ECOA, the FHA, the Homeowners Protection Act, the FCRA, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and others. Among other things, these laws prohibit payments for referrals of settlement service business, providing services to lenders for no or reduced fees or payments for services not actually performed, require fairness and non-discrimination\nin granting or facilitating the granting of credit, require cancellation of insurance and refund of unearned premiums under certain circumstances, govern the circumstances under which companies may obtain and use consumer credit information, and define the manner in which companies may pursue collection activities. Changes in these laws or regulations, changes in the appropriate regulator\u2019s\ninterpretation of these laws or regulations or heightened enforcement activity could materially adversely affect the operations and profitability of our U.S. mortgage insurance business.\nAustralia\nIn Australia, APRA regulates all ADIs and life, general and mortgage insurance companies. APRA also determines the minimum regulatory capital requirements for ADIs. APRA\u2019s current regulations provide for reduced capital requirements for certain ADIs that insure residential mortgages with an \u201cacceptable\u201d mortgage insurer (which currently includes our Australian mortgage insurance companies) for all non-standard\nmortgages and for standard mortgages with loan-to-value\nratios above 80%. APRA\u2019s regulations currently set out a number of circumstances in which a loan may be considered to be non-standard\nfrom an ADI\u2019s perspective. The capital levels for Australian IRB ADIs are determined by their APRA-approved IRB models, which may or may not allocate capital credit for LMI. APRA and the IRB ADIs have not yet finalized internal models for residential mortgage risk and we do not believe that the IRB ADIs currently benefit from an explicit reduction in their capital requirements for mortgages covered by mortgage insurance.\nUnder APRA rules, ADIs in Australia that are accredited as standardized, receive reduced capital recognition for using mortgage insurance for high loan-to-value\nmortgage loans in Australia. ADIs that are considered to be advanced accredited and determine their own capital estimates, are currently working with the mortgage insurers and APRA to determine the appropriate level of recognition mortgage insurance will provide for high loan-to-value\nmortgage loans. The rules also provide that ADIs would be able to acquire mortgage insurance covering less of the exposure to the loan than existing requirements with reduced capital recognition. Accordingly, lenders in Australia may be able to reduce their use of mortgage insurance for high loan-to-value\nratio mortgages or limit their use to the higher risk portions of their portfolios, which may have an adverse effect on our mortgage insurance business in Australia.\nUncertainty remains surrounding the implementation of the Basel framework. In March 2020, the Basel Committee revised the target date for implementation to January 1, 2023. It is too early to determine the ultimate impact these regulatory changes will have on our mortgage insurance business in Australia, but it is possible that its rules could discourage the use of mortgage insurance.\nOn December 8, 2020, APRA released a discussion paper on its proposed changes to bank capital standards in Australia. For more information about APRA and its proposed bank capital standards changes, see \u201cRegulation-Mortgage Insurance Regulation-Australia regulation.\u201d\nBasel Framework\nIn December 2017, the Basel Committee published the finalization of the post-crisis reforms to the Basel framework. Among other issues, the Basel Committee addressed variability in risk-weighted assets, including residential real estate. Currently national supervisors are considering how to implement these reforms. Because these reforms are not yet implemented by national supervisors, we cannot predict the mortgage insurance benefits, if any, that ultimately will be provided to lenders, or how any such benefits may affect the opportunities for the growth of mortgage insurance. If countries implement the Basel framework in a manner that does not reward lenders for using mortgage insurance on high loan-to-value\nmortgage loans, or if lenders conclude that mortgage insurance does not provide sufficient capital incentives, then we may have to revise our product offerings to meet the new requirements and our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to continue to mitigate the impact of Regulations XXX or AXXX and, therefore, we may incur higher operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have increased term and universal life insurance statutory reserves in response to Regulations XXX and AXXX and have taken steps to mitigate the impact these regulations have had on our business, including\nincreasing premium rates and implementing reserve funding structures. One way that we and other insurance companies have mitigated the impact of these regulations is through captive reinsurance companies and/or special purpose vehicles. If we were to discontinue our use of captive life reinsurance subsidiaries to finance statutory reserves in response to regulatory changes on a prospective basis, the reasonably likely impact would be increased costs related to alternative financing, such as third-party reinsurance, which would adversely impact our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we cannot be certain that affordable alternative financing would be available.\nOn March 7, 2016, we suspended sales of our traditional life insurance products. While we are no longer writing new life insurance business, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to continue to implement actions to mitigate the impacts of Regulations XXX or AXXX on our in-force\nterm and universal life insurance products which are not currently part of reserve funding structures or which may be part of existing reserve arrangements and need refinancing.\nAdditionally, there may be future regulatory, tax or other impacts to existing reserve funding structures and/or future refinancing, which could require us to increase statutory reserves or incur higher operating and/or tax costs. For example, effective January 1, 2017, the NAIC adopted an amended version of AG 48, which was subsequently codified in the Term and Universal Life Insurance Reserve Financing Model Regulation. This regulation becomes effective when formally adopted by the states, however, it is not clear what additional changes or state variations may emerge as the states continue to adopt this regulation. As a result, there is the potential for additional requirements making it more difficult and/or expensive for us to mitigate the impact of Regulations XXX and AXXX. To date, four states have implemented the Term and Universal Life Insurance Reserve Financing Model Regulation, including Virginia, which is the state regulator for GLAIC, one of our principal life insurance subsidiaries.\nChanges in accounting and reporting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies and insurance regulators could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. GAAP, which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board. It is possible that future accounting and reporting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the required adoption of future accounting and reporting standards may result in significant costs to implement. For example, new accounting guidance (that is not yet effective for us) related to long-duration insurance contracts will likely materially impact our financial position and could result in increased volatility in our results of operations, as well as other comprehensive income (loss). In addition, we may be unable to implement this new accounting guidance or other proposals by the adoption date which would materially adversely impact our business. Furthermore, the implementation of this new accounting guidance or other proposals could require us to make significant changes to systems and use additional resources, resulting in significant incremental costs. See note 2 in \u201cPart II-Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional details.\nOperational Risks\nIf we are unable to retain, attract and motivate qualified employees or senior management, our results of operations, financial condition and business operations may be adversely impacted.\nOur success is largely dependent on our ability to retain, attract and motivate qualified employees and senior management. We face intense competition in our industry for key employees with demonstrated ability, including actuarial, finance, legal, investment, risk, compliance and other professionals. Our ability to retain,\nattract and motivate experienced and qualified employees and senior management has been more challenging in light of our financial difficulties, announcements concerning expense reductions, as well as the demands being placed on our employees. In addition, our ability to attract, recruit, retain and motivate current and prospective employees may be adversely impacted by the repeated delays in the China Oceanwide transaction, the ensuing uncertainty and/or the potential alternative strategic direction the company may go. Furthermore, as the future of work evolves and work arrangements, such as a remote work environment become more flexible and commonplace, our ability to compete for qualified employees could be further challenged. A remote work environment could expand competition among employers and may put us at a disadvantage if we are unable or unwilling to implement certain of these policies. We cannot be sure we will be able to attract, retain and motivate the desired workforce, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on results of operations, financial condition and business operations. In addition, we may not be able to meet regulatory requirements relating to required expertise in various professional positions.\nManaging key employee succession and retention is also critical to our success. We would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior management and other key employees. While we have succession plans and long-term compensation plans, including retention programs, designed to retain our employees, our succession plans may not operate effectively and our compensation plans cannot guarantee that the services of these employees will continue to be available to us.\nOur reliance on key customer or distribution relationships could cause us to lose significant sales if one or more of those relationships terminate or are reduced.\nOur businesses depend on our relationships with our customers, and in particular, our relationships with our largest lending customers in our mortgage insurance businesses. Our customers place insurance with us directly on loans that they originate and they also do business with us indirectly, primarily in the United States, through purchases of loans that already have our mortgage insurance coverage. Our relationships with our customers may influence both the amount of business they do with us directly and also their willingness to continue to approve us as a mortgage insurance provider for loans that they purchase. Particularly in Australia where a large portion of our business is concentrated with a small number of customers, the loss of business from significant customers has had and could in the future have an adverse effect on the amount of new business we are able to write and consequently, our financial condition and results of operations. Maintaining our business relationships and business volumes with our largest lending customers remains critical to the success of our business.\nWe cannot be certain that any loss of business from significant customers, or any single lender, would be replaced by other customers, existing or new. As a result of current market conditions and increased regulatory requirements, our lending customers may decide to write business only with a limited number of mortgage insurers or only with certain mortgage insurers, based on their views with respect to an insurer\u2019s pricing, service levels, underwriting guidelines, loss mitigation practices, financial strength, ratings or other factors.\nAs discussed in \u201cPart I-Item 1 - Business,\u201d our mortgage insurance business in Australia is highly concentrated in a small number of key lender customers, which increases our risks and exposure in the event one or more of these customers terminate or reduce their relationship with us. Any termination, reduction or material change in relationship with a key lender customer could have a material adverse effect on our future sales for one or more products. In addition, some lenders self-insure certain high loan-to-value mortgage risks. If our lending customers in this market increase the self-insurance or other alternatives to mortgage insurance, this could have an unfavorable impact on the amount of new business we are able to write and consequently, our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe distribute our products through a wide variety of distribution methods, including through relationships with key distribution partners (including lender customers of our mortgage insurance businesses). These distribution partners are an integral part of our business model. We are at risk that key distribution partners may merge, change their distribution model affecting how our products are sold, or terminate their distribution\ncontracts or relationships with us. In addition, timing of key distributor adoption of our new product offerings may impact sales of those products. Some distributors have, and in the future others may, elect to terminate or reduce their distribution relationships with us for a variety of reasons, such as the result of our recent financial challenges (including adverse ratings actions). Likewise, in the future, other distributors may terminate or reduce their relationships with us as a result of, among other things, these challenges as well as future adverse developments in our business or adverse rating agency actions or concerns about market-related risks, commission levels or the breadth of our product offerings.\nWe compete with government-owned and government-sponsored enterprises in our mortgage insurance businesses, and this may put us at a competitive disadvantage on pricing and other terms and conditions.\nOur U.S. mortgage insurance business competes with the FHA and the VA, as well as certain local- and state-level housing finance agencies. Separately, the government-owned and government-sponsored enterprises, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, compete with our U.S. mortgage insurance business through certain of their risk-sharing insurance programs. Those competitors may establish pricing terms and business practices that may be influenced by motives such as advancing social housing policy or stabilizing the mortgage lending industry, which may not be consistent with maximizing return on capital or other profitability measures. In addition, those governmental enterprises typically do not have the same capital requirements that we and other mortgage insurance companies have and therefore may have financial flexibility in their pricing and capacity that could put us at a competitive disadvantage. In the event that a government-owned or sponsored entity in one of our markets determines to change prices significantly or alter the terms and conditions of its mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement products in furtherance of social or other goals rather than a profit or risk management motive, we may be unable to compete in that market effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Australia mortgage insurance business operates in a similar market as that of the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation (\u201cNHFIC\u201d), which is an Australian government-owned enterprise. In addition, we also compete with lender captives and direct mortgage insurers. The NHFIC may establish pricing terms and business practices, including offering a competitive product at no cost, that may be influenced by motives such as advancing social housing policy or stabilizing the mortgage lending industry, which may not be consistent with maximizing return on capital or other profitability measures. In the event that a government-owned or sponsored program or entity in one of our markets determines to alter the terms and conditions of its credit enhancement products in furtherance of social or other goals rather than a profit motive, we may be unable to compete in that market effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn January 1, 2020, the NHFIC launched the FHLDS, which is a program offered to support eligible first-time home buyers at no cost. For more information on FHLDS, see \u201cRegulation-Mortgage Insurance Regulation-Australia Regulation.\u201d\nOur business could be adversely impacted from deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting.\nThe design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations, particularly given our current remote work environment and the increased risk that our employees may be unable to properly perform and execute controls. While management continually reviews the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, such as those we have reported in the past, or any other failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures could result in material errors or restatements in our historical financial statements or untimely filings, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, that would result in a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nOur computer systems may fail or be compromised, and unanticipated problems could materially adversely impact our disaster recovery systems and business continuity plans, which could damage our reputation, impair our ability to conduct business effectively and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the effective operation of our computer systems. We also have arrangements in place with our partners and other third-party service providers through which we share and receive information. We rely on these systems throughout our business for a variety of functions, including processing claims and applications, providing information to customers and distributors, performing actuarial analyses and maintaining financial records. Despite the implementation of security and back-up\nmeasures, our computer systems and those of our partners and third-party service providers have been, and may be in the future, vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, computer viruses or other attacks, programming errors and similar disruptive problems. The failure of these systems for any reason could cause significant interruptions to our operations, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTechnology continues to expand and plays an ever increasing role in our business. While it is our goal to safeguard information assets from physical theft and cybersecurity threats, there can be no assurance that our information security will detect and protect information assets from these ever increasing risks. Information assets include both information itself in the form of computer data, written materials, knowledge and supporting processes, and the information technology systems, networks, other electronic devices and storage media used to store, process, retrieve and transmit that information. As more information is used and shared by our employees, customers and suppliers, both within and outside our company, cybersecurity threats become expansive in nature. Confidentiality, integrity and availability of information are essential to maintaining our reputation, legal position and ability to conduct our operations. Although we have implemented controls and continue to train our employees, a cybersecurity event could still occur which would cause damage to our reputation with our customers, distributors and other stakeholders and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe retain confidential information in our computer systems, and we rely on commercial technologies to maintain the security of those systems, including computers or mobile devices. Anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures and penetrate our computer systems or misuse authorized access could access, view, misappropriate, alter, or delete any information in the systems, including personally identifiable information, personal health information and proprietary business information. Our employees, distribution partners and other vendors use portable computers or mobile devices which may contain similar information to that in our computer systems, and these devices have been and can be lost, stolen or damaged, and therefore subject to the same risks as our other computer systems. In addition, an increasing number of states and foreign countries require that affected parties be notified or other actions be taken (which could involve significant costs to us) if a security breach results in the inappropriate disclosure of personally identifiable information. We have experienced occasional, actual or attempted breaches of our cybersecurity, although to date none of these breaches has had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation. Any compromise of the security of our computer systems or those of our partners and third-party service providers that results in inappropriate disclosure of personally identifiable customer information could damage our reputation in the marketplace, deter people from purchasing our products, subject us to significant civil and criminal liability and require us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses.\nThe area of cybersecurity has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, with various countries, government agencies and insurance regulators introducing and/or passing legislation in an attempt to safeguard personal information from the escalating cybersecurity treats. For additional details, see \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Other Laws and Regulations-Cybersecurity.\u201d\nIn addition, unanticipated problems with, or failures of, our disaster recovery systems and business continuity plans could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business and on our results of\noperations and financial condition, particularly if those problems affect our information technology systems and destroy, lose or otherwise compromise valuable data. Furthermore, in the event that a significant number of our employees were unavailable in the event of a disaster or a pandemic, our ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised. The failure of our disaster recovery systems and business continuity plans could adversely impact our profitability and our business.\nInsurance and Product-Related Risks\nWe may be unable to maintain or increase the capital needed in our U.S. mortgage insurance business in a timely manner, on anticipated terms or at all, including through improved business performance, reinsurance or similar transactions, asset sales, securities offerings or otherwise, in each case as and when required.\nWe intend to continue to support the increased capital needs of our U.S. mortgage insurance business resulting from PMIERs. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our U.S. mortgage insurance business met the PMIERs financial and operational requirements. In order to continue to provide a prudent level of financial flexibility in connection with the PMIERs capital requirements given the dynamic nature of asset valuations, requirement changes over time and recent conditions and restrictions imposed on us by the GSEs, our U.S. mortgage insurance business may be required to execute future capital transactions, including additional credit risk transfer transactions and contributions of holding company cash. See \u201c-If we are unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs because the GSEs amend them or the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the financial requirements requires us to hold amounts of capital that are higher than we have planned or otherwise, we may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nThe implementation of any further credit risk transfer transactions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to: the outcome of the China Oceanwide transaction, market conditions, third-party approvals or other actions (including approval by regulators and the GSEs), and other factors which are outside of our control, and therefore we cannot be sure we will be able to successfully implement these actions on the anticipated timetable and terms, or at all. Even if we are able to successfully implement these actions, there is no assurance we will be able to achieve the anticipated benefits from the actions. For a discussion of risks related to our strategic plans, see \u201c-We may be unable to successfully execute strategic plans to effectively address our current business challenges.\u201d\nOur financial condition, results of operations, long-term care insurance products and/or our reputation in the market may be adversely affected if we are unable to implement premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions on our in-force\nlong-term care insurance policies by enough or quickly enough.\nThe continued viability of our long-term care insurance business, as well as that of GLIC and GLICNY, is based on our ability to obtain significant premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions on our in-force\nlong-term care insurance products, as warranted and actuarially justified. The adequacy of our current long-term care insurance reserves also depends significantly on certain assumptions regarding our ability to successfully execute our in-force\nmanagement rate action plan through premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions. We include assumptions for future in-force\nrate actions, which includes assumptions for significant premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions that have been approved or are anticipated to be approved (including premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions not yet filed), in our determination of loss recognition testing of our long-term care insurance reserves under U.S. GAAP and asset adequacy testing of our statutory long-term care insurance reserves. In 2020, our long-term care insurance block, excluding our acquired block, includes an assumption for future in-force rate actions (anticipated to be approved, including premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions not yet filed) of approximately $8.0 billion in its loss recognition testing.\nAlthough the terms of our long-term care insurance policies permit us to increase premiums under certain circumstances during the premium-paying period, these increases generally require regulatory approval, which can often take a long time to obtain and may not be obtained in all relevant jurisdictions or for the full amounts requested. In addition, some states are considering adopting long-term care insurance rate increase legislation that would further limit increases in long-term care insurance premium rates beyond the rate stability legislation previously adopted in certain states, which would adversely impact our ability to achieve anticipated rate increases. Furthermore, some states have refused to approve actuarially justified rate actions.\nWe will not be able to realize our future premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions in the future if we cannot obtain the required regulatory approvals. In this event, we would have to increase our long-term care insurance reserves by amounts that would likely be material and would result in a material adverse impact. Moreover, we may not be able to sufficiently mitigate the impact of unexpected adverse experience through premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions. Given the ongoing pressure to earnings from higher incurred claims in our long-term care insurance business, absent the future premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions, our results of operations, capital levels, RBC and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. In addition, if the timing of our future premium rate increases and associated benefit reductions takes longer to achieve than originally assumed, we would likely record higher reserves with no offsetting premiums and associated benefit reductions from in-force\nrate actions to mitigate the negative impact, which would likely result in an operating loss for our long-term care insurance business.\nPolicyholders may be unwilling or unable to pay the increased premium rates we will seek to charge. We cannot predict how our policyholders and regulators may react to any in-force\nrate increases, nor can we predict if regulators will approve requested in-force\nrate increases.\nReinsurance may not be available, affordable or adequate to protect us against losses.\nAs part of our overall risk and capital management strategy, we purchase reinsurance from external reinsurers, use credit risk transfer transactions and provide internal reinsurance support for certain risks underwritten by our various business segments. These reinsurance arrangements and credit risk transfer transactions are intended to enable our businesses to transfer risks in exchange for some of the associated economic benefits and, as a result, improve our statutory capital position, manage risk to within our tolerance level and improve the PMIERs position of our U.S. mortgage insurance business. Some of these reinsurance arrangements are indefinite, but others require periodic renewals (such as reinsurance contracts in Australia). For these arrangements, at the end of the base term, we can elect a runoff term to continue coverage, with reducing amounts of regulatory capital benefits, or attempt to negotiate a renewal. The availability and cost of reinsurance protection are impacted by our operating and financial performance, including ratings, as well as conditions beyond our control. For example, our financial challenges and adverse rating actions may reduce the availability of certain types of reinsurance and make it more costly when it is available, as reinsurers are less willing to take on credit risk in a volatile market. Accordingly, we may be forced to incur additional expenses for reinsurance or may not be able to obtain new reinsurance or renew existing reinsurance arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all, which could increase our risk and adversely affect our ability to obtain statutory capital credit for new reinsurance or could require us to make capital contributions to maintain regulatory capital requirements. Likewise, our U.S. mortgage insurance business has incurred higher expenses associated with credit risk transfer transactions during 2020 for a variety of reasons, including COVID-19\nand may be unable to obtain new transactions on acceptable terms or at all in the future. Absent the availability and affordability to enter into new credit risk transfer transactions, the ability of our U.S. mortgage insurance business to obtain PMIERs or statutory credit for new transactions could be adversely impacted. See \u201c-If we are unable to continue to meet the requirements mandated by PMIERs because the GSEs amend them or the GSEs\u2019 interpretation of the financial requirements requires us to hold amounts of capital that are higher than we have planned or otherwise, we may not be eligible to write new insurance on loans acquired by the GSEs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nWe also manage risk and capital allocated to our long-term care insurance business through utilization of external reinsurance in the form of coinsurance. We executed external reinsurance agreements to reinsure 20% of all sales of our individual long-term care insurance products that have been introduced since early 2013. External new business reinsurance is dependent on a number of factors, including price, availability, risk tolerance and capital levels. Over time, there can be no assurance that affordable, or any, reinsurance will continue to be available. We also have external reinsurance on some older blocks of business which includes a treaty on a yearly renewable term basis on business that was written between 1998 and 2003. This yearly renewable term reinsurance provides coverage for claims on those policies for 15 years after the policy was written. After 15 years, reinsurance coverage ends for policies not on claim, while reinsurance coverage continues for policies on claim until the claim ends. The 15-year\ncoverage on the policies written in 2003 expired in 2018; therefore, any new claims will not have reinsurance coverage under this treaty. Since 2013, we have seen, and may continue to see, an increase in our benefit costs as policies with reinsurance coverage exhaust their benefits or terminate and policies which are not covered by reinsurance go on claim.\nA decrease in the volume of high loan-to-value\nhome mortgage originations or an increase in the volume of mortgage insurance cancellations could result in a decline in our revenue in our mortgage insurance businesses.\nWe provide mortgage insurance primarily for high loan-to-value\nmortgages. Factors that could lead to a decrease in the volume of high loan-to-value\nmortgage originations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nan increase in the level of home mortgage interest rates and, in the United States, a reduction or loss of mortgage interest deductibility for federal income tax purposes;\n\u2022\nimplementation of more rigorous mortgage lending regulation, such as under APRA Prudential Practice Guides in Australia;\n\u2022\na decline in economic conditions generally, or in conditions in regional and local economies;\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer confidence, which may be adversely affected by economic instability, war or terrorist events;\n\u2022\nan increase in the price of homes relative to income levels;\n\u2022\nadverse population trends, including lower homeownership rates;\n\u2022\nhigh rates of home price appreciation, which for refinancings affect whether refinanced loans have loan-to-value\nratios that require mortgage insurance; and\n\u2022\nchanges in government housing policy encouraging loans to first-time home buyers.\nA decline in the volume of high loan-to-value\nmortgage originations would reduce the demand for mortgage insurance and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, a significant percentage of the premiums we earn each year in our U.S. mortgage insurance business are renewal premiums from insurance policies written in previous years. We estimate that approximately 85% of our U.S. gross premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2020 were renewal premiums compared to approximately 88% for both the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. As a result, the length of time insurance remains in-force\nis an important determinant of our mortgage insurance revenues. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and many other mortgage investors in the United States generally permit a homeowner to ask the loan servicer to cancel the borrower\u2019s obligation to pay for mortgage insurance when the principal amount of the mortgage falls below 80% of the home\u2019s value. Factors that tend to reduce the length of time our mortgage insurance remains in-force\ninclude:\n\u2022\ndeclining interest rates, which may result in the refinancing of the mortgages underlying our insurance policies with new mortgage loans that may not require mortgage insurance or that we do not insure;\n\u2022\nsignificant appreciation in the value of homes, which causes the size of the mortgage to decrease below 80% of the value of the home and enables the borrower to request cancellation of the mortgage insurance; and\n\u2022\nchanges in mortgage insurance cancellation requirements under applicable federal law or mortgage insurance cancellation practices by mortgage lenders and investors.\nOur U.S. mortgage primary persistency rates were 59%, 76% and 82% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A decrease in persistency in the U.S. market generally would reduce the amount of our insurance in-force\nand could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. However, higher persistency on certain products, especially A minus, Alt-A,\nARMs and certain 100% loan-to-value\nloans, could have a material adverse effect if claims generated by such products remain elevated or increase.\nThe amount of mortgage insurance we write could decline significantly if alternatives to private mortgage insurance are used or lower coverage levels of mortgage insurance are selected.\nThere are a variety of alternatives to private mortgage insurance that may reduce the amount of mortgage insurance we write. These alternatives include:\n\u2022\noriginating mortgages in the United States that consist of two simultaneous loans, known as \u201csimultaneous seconds,\u201d comprising a first mortgage with a loan-to-value\nratio of 80% and a simultaneous second mortgage for the excess portion of the loan, instead of a single mortgage with a loan-to-value\nratio of more than 80%;\n\u2022\nusing government mortgage insurance programs;\n\u2022\nholding mortgages in the lenders\u2019 own loan portfolios and self-insuring;\n\u2022\nusing programs, such as those offered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the United States, requiring lower mortgage insurance coverage levels;\n\u2022\noriginating and securitizing loans in mortgage-backed securities whose underlying mortgages are not insured with private mortgage insurance or which are structured so that the risk of default lies with the investor, rather than a private mortgage insurer; and\n\u2022\nusing risk-sharing insurance programs, credit default swaps or similar instruments, instead of private mortgage insurance, to transfer credit risk on mortgages.\nThe degree to which lenders or borrowers may select these alternatives now, or in the future, is difficult to predict. As one or more of the alternatives described above, or new alternatives that enter the market, are chosen over mortgage insurance, our revenues could be adversely impacted. The loss of business in general or the specific loss of more profitable business could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nPotential liabilities in connection with our U.S. contract underwriting services could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe offer contract underwriting services to certain of our mortgage lenders in the United States, pursuant to which our employees and contractors work directly with the lender to determine whether the data relating to a borrower and a proposed loan contained in a mortgage loan application file complies with the lender\u2019s loan underwriting guidelines or the investor\u2019s loan purchase requirements. In connection with that service, we also compile the application data and submit it to the automated underwriting systems of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which independently analyze the data to determine if the proposed loan complies with their investor requirements.\nUnder the terms of our contract underwriting agreements, we agree to indemnify the lender against losses incurred in the event that we make material errors in determining whether loans processed by our contract underwriters meet specified underwriting or purchase criteria, subject to contractual limitations on liability. As a result, we assume credit and processing risk in connection with our contract underwriting services. If our reserves for potential claims in connection with our contract underwriting services are inadequate as a result of differences from our estimates and assumptions or other reasons, we may be required to increase our underlying reserves, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nMedical advances, such as genetic research and diagnostic imaging, and related legislation could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our life insurance, long-term care insurance and annuity businesses.\nGenetic testing research and discovery is advancing at a rapid pace. Though some of this research is focused on identifying the genes associated with rare diseases, much of the research is focused on identifying the genes associated with an increased risk of various diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Diagnostic testing utilizing various blood panels or imaging techniques, including the use of artificial intelligence, may allow clinicians to detect similar diseases during an earlier treatment phase and prescribe more acute medicine or treatments. We believe that if an individual learns through such testing that they are predisposed to a condition that may reduce their life expectancy or increase their chances of requiring long-term care, they potentially will be more likely to purchase life and long-term care insurance policies or not permit their existing policy to lapse. In contrast, if an individual learns that they lack the genetic predisposition to develop the conditions that reduce longevity or require long-term care, they potentially will be less likely to purchase life and long-term care insurance products, but more likely to purchase certain annuity products and permit their life and long-term care insurance policies to lapse.\nBeing able to access and use the medical information (including the results of genetic and diagnostic testing) known to our prospective policyholders is important to ensure that an underwriting risk assessment matches the anticipated risk priced into our life and long-term care insurance products, as well as our annuity products. Currently, there are some state level restrictions related to an insurer\u2019s access and use of genetic information, and periodically new genetic testing legislation is being introduced. However, further restrictions on the access and use of such medical information could create a mismatch between an assessed risk and the product pricing. Such a mismatch has the potential to increase product pricing causing a decrease in sales to lower risk individuals resulting in higher risk individuals becoming the more likely buyer. In addition, it is possible that regulators may enforce anti-discrimination provisions even when medical information is available that indicates a purchaser is at higher risk. The net result of this could cause a deterioration in the risk profile of our portfolio which could lead to payments to our policyholders and contractholders that are materially higher than anticipated. Any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition to earlier diagnosis or knowledge of disease risk, medical advances may also lead to newer forms of preventive care which could improve an individual\u2019s overall health and/or longevity. If this were to occur, the duration of payments made by us under certain forms of long-term care and life insurance policies or annuity contracts would likely increase thereby reducing our profitability on those products. Conversely, slower progressing medical advances, particularly in the areas of cognitive decline, could adversely impact our long-term care insurance business as policyholders may remain on claim for a long period of time resulting in higher severity and duration of claims.\nOther General Risk\nThe occurrence of natural or man-made\ndisasters or a future pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and tornadoes, and man-made\ndisasters, including acts of terrorism and military actions and pandemics.\nFor example, a natural or man-made\ndisaster or a pandemic, similar to COVID-19,\ncould disrupt our computer systems and our ability to conduct or process business, as well as lead to unexpected changes in policyholders and contractholders behavior. The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made\ndisaster or a pandemic could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas, as well as an adverse effect on home prices in those areas, which could result in increased loss experience in our mortgage insurance businesses. Disasters or a pandemic also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations.", "PERMNO": 90162, "SIC": 6311, "TIC": "GNW"}
