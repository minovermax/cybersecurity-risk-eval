{"cik": "1008654", "company": "TUPPERWARE BRANDS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the Company that could adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that the Company currently believes to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that could adversely affect the Company. Other events that the Company does not currently anticipate or that the Company currently deems immaterial also may affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations. Before making an investment in the Company\u2019s securities, investors should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below, together with the other information in this Report, including the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the other reports and materials filed by the Company with the SEC.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the Company\u2019s operations, including those operations performed for the Company by third parties. This would include but is not limited to the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees or others, errors relating to transaction processing, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and unplanned interruptions in service. Certain of these types of activities were identified in the course of the Company\u2019s review of its Mexico businesses. Over the past year, the Company, with the help of external legal and accounting resources, has investigated matters at its Mexico businesses primarily regarding the accounting for accounts payable and accrued liabilities and inventory. While the Company's review of these matters is now complete, there can be no assurances that the SEC or other governmental agencies will not determine to bring enforcement action with respect thereto or that similar issues will not be identified in the future.\nThe risk of operational loss also includes other potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency, or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards. The Company must comply with a number of legal and regulatory requirements, including those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As described in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, the Company concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 26, 2020 due to a material weakness in the control environment at its Tupperware Mexico location; specifically, with respect to information technology general controls, the Company did not maintain effective user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and to adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications and data to appropriate Company personnel; and there was override by plant and local management of certain internal controls at the Tupperware Mexico plant location resulting in immaterial misstatements in inventory and accrued liabilities. There were no changes to previously issued financial statements.\nAs further described in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, the Company is implementing remedial measures and, while there can be no assurance that its efforts will be successful, the Company expects to remediate the material weakness prior to the end of fiscal year 2021. If the Company is unable to remediate the material weakness, or is otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, the ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and within required time periods, could be adversely affected. This could subject the Company to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in the Company\u2019s financial statements and adversely impact its stock price. Furthermore, until the Company successfully remediates the material weakness, it is reasonably possible that this material weakness could result in a material misstatement to the Company\u2019s annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.\nSales Force Factors\nThe Company is largely dependent upon the independent sales organizations and individuals to reach end consumers, and any significant disruption of this distribution network would have a negative financial impact on the Company and its ability to generate sales, earnings, and operating cash flows. The Company\u2019s distribution system depends upon successful addition, activation and retention of a large number of independent sales force members. The addition, retention and activation of sales force members is dependent upon the competitive environment among other companies who also use this channel of distribution and upon the general labor market, unemployment levels, general economic conditions, demographic and cultural changes in the workforce and the level of penetration of the Company's sales force in the geographies in which it operates as well as the introduction of new products.\nThe Company\u2019s sales are directly tied to the activity levels of its sales force, which is in large part a temporary working activity for many sales force members. Activity levels may be affected by the degree to which a market is penetrated by the presence of the Company\u2019s sales force, the amount of average sales per order, the amount of sales per sales force member, the mix of high-margin and low-margin products sold at group demonstrations and elsewhere, and the activities and actions of the Company\u2019s product line and channel competitors. The Company\u2019s sales force members may be affected by initiatives undertaken by the Company to grow its revenue base or change its cost base which may lead to the inaccurate perception that the independent sales force system is at risk of being phased out or the Company intends to exit markets.\nFurthermore, due to the high level of competition in the Company\u2019s industry, the Company might fail to retain its independent sales force and their customers, which would harm the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. The Company is subject to significant competition for the recruitment of independent sales force from other direct selling businesses. We compete globally for potential customers and independent sales force, and if we are unable to successfully compete with other direct selling and related businesses, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nConsumer Demand\nThe Company's business is subject to changes in consumer trends and demands such as the types of products and materials the Company offers, the ease of finding and ordering the product, and the speed at which the products can be delivered. The Company's ability to accurately predict and respond to these changes could impact the Company's financial results. The Company currently has an immaterial amount of its sales derived from channels other than direct selling. The reliance on this dominant channel in an environment where the consumer expects a frictionless experience could impact the Company's business. Furthermore, reliance on this dominant channel was impacted by the pandemic, and while the Company's sales force was able to utilize digital tools and social media to compensate for quarantine restrictions, this sales channel could be impacted further if other avenues for communicating with customers are unavailable.\nInternational Operations\nThe Company is subject to risks of doing business internationally. The Company has derived, for a number of years, most of its net sales from operations outside the United States. An economic slowdown in any of the countries where the Company operates could materially affect the Company's revenues and operating results. Although these operations are geographically dispersed, which partially mitigates the risks associated with operating in particular countries, the Company is subject to the usual risks associated with international operations. Among others, these risks include local political and economic environments, adverse new tax regulations, potentially burdensome privacy protocols, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation, and relations between the United States and foreign governments. In addition, the Company does business in developing countries, some of which have higher risk profiles, and some of the international jurisdictions in which the Company operates have a different, or less developed, legal system that lacks transparency in certain respects relative to that of the United States, and can accord local government authorities a higher degree of control and discretion over business than is customary in the United States.\nMovement in exchange rates has had and may continue to have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s earnings, cash flows and financial position. The Company\u2019s most significant exposures are to the Brazilian Real, Chinese Renminbi, Argentine Peso, Euro, Indonesian Rupiah, Malaysian Ringgit, Mexican Peso and South African Rand. Although the Company's currency risk is partially mitigated by the natural hedge arising from its local product sourcing in many markets, a strengthening United States Dollar generally has a negative impact on the Company. In response to this fact, the Company continues to implement foreign currency hedging and risk management strategies to reduce the exposure to fluctuations in earnings associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company generally does not seek to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on the translated value of the sales, profit or cash flow generated by its operations. Some of the hedging strategies implemented have a positive or negative impact on cash flows as foreign currencies fluctuate versus the United States Dollar. There can be no assurance that foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities will not have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.\nAnother risk associated with the Company\u2019s international operations is restrictions foreign governments may impose on currency remittances. Due to the possibility of government restrictions (or existing restrictions) on transfers of cash out of countries and control of exchange rates and currency convertibility, the Company may not be able to immediately access its cash at the exchange rate used to translate its financial statements. As of the end of 2020, this was a particular issue in China, as the Company must apply locally for repatriation of dividends out of China, a process which can typically take approximately six months.\nIn addition, the Company operates in many different jurisdictions, including jurisdictions that are considered high-risk countries, and the Company could be adversely affected by violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws. The FCPA and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The Company's internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. The Company operates in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Despite the Company's training and compliance programs, the Company cannot assure you that its internal control policies and procedures always will protect the Company from reckless or criminal acts committed by Company's employees or agents. The Company's continued expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations in the future. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt the Company's business and result in a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.\nFinally, the Company's global operations expose the Company to a number of additional risks, including:\n\u2022changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political, social or economic conditions, particularly in emerging markets;\n\u2022civil unrest, turmoil or outbreak of disease or illness, such as the novel coronavirus, in any of the countries in which we sell our products or in which we or our suppliers operate;\n\u2022tariffs, other trade protection measures, as discussed in more detail below, and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022potential adverse changes in trade agreements between the United States and foreign countries;\n\u2022uncertainty and potentially negative consequences relating to the implementation of the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d);\n\u2022potentially negative consequences from changes in United States and international tax laws;\n\u2022difficulty in staffing and managing geographically widespread operations;\n\u2022differing labor regulations;\n\u2022requirements relating to withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022different regulatory regimes controlling the protection of our intellectual property;\n\u2022restrictions on our ability to own or operate subsidiaries, make investments or acquire new businesses in these jurisdictions;\n\u2022restrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022difficulty in collecting international accounts receivable;\n\u2022difficulty in enforcement of contractual obligations not within United States legal jurisdiction;\n\u2022transportation delays or interruptions;\n\u2022changes in regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022the burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, including, but not limited to, conflicting labor and employment laws.\nSee Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion regarding this risk.\nLegal, Litigation and Regulatory Issues\nThe Company's business may also be affected by actions of domestic and foreign governments to restrict the activities of direct selling companies for various reasons, including a limitation on the ability of direct selling companies to operate without the involvement of a traditional retail channel. Foreign governments may also introduce other forms of protectionist legislation, such as limitations or requirements on where the products can or must be produced or requirements that non-domestic companies doing or seeking to do business place a certain percentage of ownership of legal entities in the hands of local nationals to protect the commercial interests of its citizens. Customs laws, tariffs, import duties, export and import quotas and restrictions on repatriation of foreign earnings and/or other methods of accessing cash generated internationally, may negatively affect the Company's local or corporate operations. Governments may seek either to impose taxes on independent sales force members, to classify independent sales force members as employees of direct selling companies with whom they may be associated, triggering employment-related taxes on the Company's sales force and/or the direct selling companies, or to impose registration requirements that could impact prospects' willingness to join the sales force. Some governments prohibit or impose limitations on the requirement to purchase demonstration products upon joining a direct selling business and/or the types of activities for which sales force can be compensated. The United States government may impose restrictions on the Company's ability to engage in business in other countries in connection with the foreign policy of the United States.\nFurthermore, the Company may face material litigation outside the ordinary that could materially adversely impact the Company's results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In February 2020, putative stockholder class actions were filed against the Company and certain current and former officers and directors in the United States District Court for the Central District of California and in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. The actions were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, and a lead plaintiff was appointed. On July 31, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended complaint, which alleges that statements in public filings between January 31, 2018 and February 24, 2020 (the \u201cpotential class period\u201d) regarding the Company\u2019s disclosure of controls and procedures, as well as the need for an amendment of its credit facility, violated Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Act of 1934. The plaintiffs seek to represent a class of stockholders who purchased the Company\u2019s stock during the potential class period and demand unspecified monetary damages. While the Company's motion to dismiss the complaint was granted on January 25, 2021, the court permitted the lead plaintiff to file an amended complaint, which the plaintiff filed on February 16, 2021. The Company continues to believe the complaints and allegations to be without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the actions. The Company is unable at this time to determine whether the outcome of these actions would have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nAdditionally, several putative stockholders filed stockholder derivative complaints in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida against certain of the Company\u2019s current and former officers and directors. The cases were consolidated, and plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint on August 5, 2020. The consolidated amended complaint asserts claims against certain current and former officers and directors for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and contribution for violations of the securities laws based on allegations that the officers and directors allowed the Company to make false or misleading statements in violation of the securities laws. The Court stayed proceedings in this action pending resolution of the motion to dismiss in the putative stockholder class action. A similar stockholder derivative complaint was filed in the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida. The parties reached an agreement to stay this action pending the resolution of the motion to dismiss in the putative stockholder class action. Following dismissal of the consolidated amended complaint and filing of the consolidated second amended complaint, the Company intends to seek a further stay of the derivative cases. The Company is unable at this time to determine whether the outcome of these actions would have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nFinancial Covenants, Liquidity and Existing Debt\nThe Company must meet certain financial covenants as defined in the applicable agreements to borrow under its credit facilities. In the event the Company fails to comply with any of the covenants or to meet its payment obligations, it could lead to an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations. The Company may not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy its debt obligations in the event of an acceleration of all or a portion of its outstanding obligations. If the Company\u2019s cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund its debt service obligations, it may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance its indebtedness. The Company\u2019s ability to restructure or refinance its debt in the future will depend on market conditions and the Company\u2019s financial performance at such time. Any refinancing, if at all, of the Company\u2019s debt could be at higher interest rates and may require the Company to comply with more covenants, which could further restrict its business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict the Company from adopting some of these alternatives.\nDuring the first quarter of 2020, the Company completed an Amendment related to its $650.0 million Credit Agreement providing debt covenant relief through increasing the leverage ratio as noted in Note 17: Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Report, allowing the needed flexibility to execute the Turnaround Plan and respond to COVID-19. During the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2020 the Company retired its Senior Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $600.0 million through tender offers, open-market purchases, and redemption by using cash on hand and the proceeds from the Term Loan received in December 2020 that it successfully obtained during the fourth quarter of 2020. While the Company has made significant progress with respect to managing its overall liquidity, the Company's Term Loan matures on December 3, 2023, and the Company's Credit Agreement matures on March 29, 2024. If the Company is unable to refinance its Term Loan and Credit Agreement, or if the Company refinances its indebtedness on terms that are less favorable than those currently contained in the Term Loan agreement and the Credit Agreement, the Company's liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted.\nThe Company's Tupperware trademark is collateral under the Credit Agreement and the Term Loan. The Company\u2019s iconic Tupperware brand has worldwide recognition, and the Company\u2019s continuing success, including the value of its collateral under the Credit Agreement and Term Loan, depends on its ability to maintain and enhance its brand protection, image and reputation. Maintaining, promoting and growing the Tupperware brand will depend on design and marketing efforts, sales force and consumer promotions and campaigns, product innovation and product quality. The Company\u2019s commitment to product innovation and quality and its continuing investment in design and brand awareness may not have the desired impact on its brand image and reputation. In addition, the Company\u2019s success in maintaining, extending and expanding its brand image depends on its ability to adapt to a rapidly changing social media environment and digital dissemination of branding campaigns. The Company could be adversely impacted if it fails to achieve any of these objectives.\nProduct Safety & Environmental\nCertain of the materials used in the Company\u2019s product lines may give rise to concerns of consumers based upon scientific theories which are espoused from time to time, including the risk of certain materials leaching out of plastic containers used for their intended purposes or the ingredients used in cosmetics, personal care, or nutritional products causing harm to human health. This includes polycarbonate, which contains the chemical Bisphenol A, and polyethersulfone, which contains the chemical Bisphenol S. It is the Company\u2019s policy to market products in each of its business units containing only those materials or ingredients that are approved by relevant regulatory authorities for contact with food or skin or for ingestion by consumers, as applicable.\nIn addition, the Company operates manufacturing facilities in the United States and around the world, and is subject to numerous environmental regulations with respect to the operation of those facilities. If the Company were to experience a material adverse environmental event at one of those facilities, or if the Company were to experience any material product safety issue or other significant issue with respect to its products or resins, the Company's results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nSenior Leadership Team; Management Succession; Change in CEO\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of qualified personnel at all levels, including its senior management team and other key employees. Their motivation, skills, experience, contacts and industry knowledge significantly benefit the Company\u2019s operations and administration. The failure to attract, motivate and retain members of the senior management team could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. During 2020, the composition of the Company\u2019s senior management has changed substantially. On March 12, 2020, Richard Goudis became the Company\u2019s Executive Vice Chairman. On April 6, 2020, Miguel Fernandez became the Company\u2019s President & Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Fernandez replaced the Company's interim Chief Executive Officer, Christopher O\u2019Leary, who remained a director. After the hiring of Messrs. Fernandez and Goudis, the Company continued to make significant leadership changes, including through the hiring of Patricio Cuesta as President, Commercial, Hector Lezama, as President, Commercial Business Expansion, and the promotion of Cassandra Harris to Chief Financial Officer & Chief Operating Officer. Any significant leadership change or senior management transition involves inherent risk and any failure to ensure a smooth transition could hinder the Company\u2019s strategic planning, execution, and future performance. A change in the senior management team may create uncertainty among investors, employees and others concerning the Company\u2019s future direction and performance. Any disruption in the Company\u2019s operations or uncertainty could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nTechnology and Cyber-Security\nThe Company relies extensively on information technology systems to conduct its business, some of which are managed by third-party service providers. These systems include, but are not limited to, programs and processes relating to internal communications and communications with other parties, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, receiving orders and shipping product to customers, billing customers and receiving and applying payments, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, collecting and storing certain customer, employee, investor, and other stakeholder information and personal data, and other processes necessary to manage the Company\u2019s business. Current and increased information technology security threats, and current and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a risk to the security of the information technology systems, networks, and services of the Company, its customers and other business partners, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data of the Company, its customers and other business partners. Furthermore, the risk of a cybersecurity incident is heightened as more of the Company's employees work remotely. As a result, the Company\u2019s information technology systems, networks or service providers could be damaged or cease to function properly or the Company could suffer a loss or disclosure of business, personal or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, including catastrophic events, power outages and security breaches. Although the Company has business continuity plans in place, if these plans do not provide effective alternative processes on a timely basis, the Company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct its operations, which may adversely affect its business. The Company may need to expend additional resources in the future to continue to protect against, or to address problems caused by, any business interruptions or data security breaches. Any business interruptions or data security breaches, including cyber-security breaches resulting in private data disclosure, could result in lawsuits or regulatory proceedings, damage the Company\u2019s reputation or adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that could cover some of these types of issues, the coverage has limitations and includes deductibles such that it may not be adequate to offset losses incurred.\nThe Company could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems or software are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into its operations, as well as if the capacity and system limitations of the Company's information technology systems or software are exceeded due to the number of the Company's employees working from home during COVID-19 restrictions. Various measures have been implemented to manage the risks related to the implementation and modification of hardware and software, but any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of new or upgraded information technology systems or software could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. The Company is continuing to upgrade its systems on a worldwide basis, and as disclosed in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the Company incurred a $30.5 million write-off of capitalized software implementation costs related to the front and back office standardization project that was initiated in 2017, due to a shift in the business model and digital strategy set forward by the new leadership team.\nTurnaround Plan\nIn 2020, the Company accelerated transformation initiatives, initiated in the past few years, and developed a comprehensive Turnaround Plan. As the Company works to implement the Turnaround Plan, it may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from one or more of the various restructuring and cost-savings programs undertaken as part of these efforts in full or in part or within the time periods expected. It also may not realize the increase in sales intended to be enabled by the initiatives. The Company's ability to improve its operating results depends upon a significant number of factors, some of which are beyond its control. Other events and circumstances, such as financial and strategic difficulties and delays or unexpected costs, including the impact of foreign currency and inflationary pressures, may occur which could result in not realizing targets or in offsetting the financial benefits of reaching those targets. Reaching those targets may also depend on the level of acceptance by the Company's sales force of its compensation initiatives. The Company might also experience a decline in revenue in the short-term, as part of the implementation of the Turnaround Plan, with the goal of increasing profits in the future. If the Company is unable to realize the anticipated savings or benefits, or otherwise fails to invest in the growth initiatives, the business may be adversely affected. In addition, any plans to invest these savings and benefits ahead of future growth means that such costs will be incurred whether or not these savings and benefits are realized. The Company is also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with these initiatives, and the failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from such initiatives could have a material adverse effect on business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurthermore, success of the Turnaround Plan depends on the Company's ability to compete with other companies in the same markets. The business of marketing the Company\u2019s products is highly competitive and sensitive to the introduction of new products, which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market. These market segments include numerous manufacturers, distributors, marketers, and retailers that actively compete for the business of consumers both in the United States and abroad. In addition, the Company is subject to increasing competition from sellers that utilize digital platforms. Some of these competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, product development, marketing and sales resources, more innovative sales channels or platforms, greater name recognition, larger established customer bases and better-developed distribution channels than the Company does. The Company\u2019s present or future competitors may be able to develop products that are comparable or superior to those offered by the Company, adapt more quickly than the Company does to new technologies, evolving industry trends and standards or customer requirements, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than the Company does. For example, if the Company\u2019s competitors develop other products to help store, serve and prepare food that prove to be more effective than the Company\u2019s products, demand for Company\u2019s products could be reduced. Accordingly, competition may intensify and the Company may not be able to compete effectively in its markets.\nFinally, the Company might not be able to continue to keep pace with and meet consumer demands for the Company's products. The Company has experienced, and may continue to experience, challenges in supplying products to meet customer demands, and might not be able to modify its internal systems, business practices, supply chain arrangements and logistical support mechanisms quickly enough to meet these demands. If the Company is unsuccessful in keeping pace with these demands, the Company's results of operations could be materially adversely effected.\nNatural Disasters and Unusual Weather Conditions, Pandemic Outbreaks (Including COVID-19), Terrorist Acts, Global Political Events and Other Serious Catastrophic Events\nThese types of events could disrupt business and otherwise materially adversely affect business and financial condition. With operations in many states and multiple foreign countries, the Company is subject to numerous risks outside of its control, including risks arising from natural disasters, such as fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks and other global health emergencies, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, or similar disruptions that could materially adversely affect business and financial performance.\nAny public health emergencies, including a real or potential global pandemic such as those caused by the avian flu, SARS, Ebola, coronavirus, or even a particularly virulent flu, could decrease demand for the Company's products and ability to offer them through parties held by the sales force. The worldwide outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a \u201cpandemic,\u201d has impacted worldwide economic activity. The Company's employees, contractors, suppliers, sales force, consumers, and other business partners have been forced to conduct more limited business activities for an extended period of time, including due to required shutdowns requested or mandated by governmental authorities. The Company's top priority is to protect its employees and their families, the sales force and consumers, and its operations from any adverse impacts. The Company has taken precautionary measures as directed by health authorities and local governments. COVID-19 has and may continue to have an impact on ports and trade into and out of countries around the world. Given the interconnectivity of global supply chain and global economy, the impact of COVID-19 has been extensive. While COVID-19 has had a negative impact on some of the Company's suppliers and customers, the Company believes it has also experienced a positive impact from COVID-19 on overall net sales (as many customers are working from home). We are unable to predict the impact on the Company's business when quarantining and other stay-at-home restrictions are lifted due to COVID-19, and the Company's business may be materially adversely effected upon cessation of restrictions related to COVID-19.\nUncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect travel and the ability of businesses to remain open, which could lead to decreased ability for sales force to connect with customers and materially adversely affect short-term results of operations. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could materially adversely affect the Company's reputation, business and financial condition.\nGeneral Business Factors\nThe Company\u2019s business can be affected by a wide range of factors that affect other businesses. Weather, natural disasters, strikes, epidemics/pandemics, political instability, terrorist activity, public scrutiny of the direct selling channel, and changing attitudes regarding plastic products may have a significant impact on the willingness or ability of consumers to attend parties or otherwise purchase the Company\u2019s products. The supply and cost of raw materials, particularly petroleum and natural gas-based resins, may have an impact on the availability or cost of the Company\u2019s plastic products. The Company is also subject to frequent product counterfeiting and other intellectual property infringement, which may be difficult to police and prevent, depending upon the ability to identify infringers and the availability and/or enforceability of intellectual property rights. The Company can also experience volatility in its common stock due to various factors, including negative investor sentiment. Other risks, as discussed in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this Report, can be relevant to performance as well.", "PERMNO": 83462, "SIC": 3089, "TIC": "TUP"}
