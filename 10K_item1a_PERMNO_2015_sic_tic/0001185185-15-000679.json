Risk Factors\nWe have described below risks we are aware of that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results of operations and financial condition and the value of our stock owned by our shareholders.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated through maintenance and support revenue. Decreases in maintenance and support sales or renewal rates, or a decrease in the number of new licenses we sell, will negatively impact our future revenue and financial results.\nRevenue from maintenance and support services, or M&S, we provide our customers comprised 56%, 57% and 49% of our total revenue in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We earn M&S revenue from new M&S contracts, typically sold with new software licenses, and from renewals of such contracts. Any reduction in the number of new software licenses that we sell, or a reduction in sales of associated initial M&S contracts, therefore may have a long-term negative impact on our future M&S revenue, even if our customers continue to renew M&S contracts at historical rates. This situation, in turn, would impact our business and harm our financial results.\nOur customers have no obligation to purchase M&S with their initial software license or renew their M&S contract after the expiration of their initial M&S period, which is typically one year. Our customers\u2019 purchases of M&S, and our renewal rates, may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the overall global economy, the health of their businesses, and the perceived value of the M&S program. If our customers do not purchase M&S with their initial software license or renew their M&S contract for our products, our M&S revenue will decline and our financial results will suffer. In addition, customers are generally entitled to reduced annual maintenance fees for entering into long-term maintenance contracts, i.e. those contracts with a term longer than one year. Declines in our license bookings, increases in the proportion of long-term maintenance contracts and/or increased discounting could lead to declines in our maintenance revenue growth rates. Should customers migrate from systems and applications which our products support, utilize alternatives to our products, including solutions offering free maintenance, or become dissatisfied with our maintenance services, increased cancellations could lead to declines in our maintenance revenue.\nA substantial portion of our quarterly M&S revenue is attributable to M&S agreements entered into during previous quarters. As a result, if there is a decline in renewed M&S agreements in any one quarter, only a small portion of the decline will be reflected in our M&S revenue recognized in that quarter and the remainder will be reflected in our M&S revenue recognized in the following four quarters or more and in a decrease in deferred revenue on our balance sheet. For more information, see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d.\nOur ability to sell our products is highly dependent on the quality of our support and services offerings. Our failure to offer high-quality support and services could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOnce our products are deployed at our end customers\u2019 locations, our end customers may depend on our support organization and our channel partners to resolve issues relating to our products. High-quality support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our products. If we or our channel partners do not assist our end customers in deploying our products effectively, succeed in helping our customers resolve post-deployment issues quickly, or provide ongoing support, it could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to existing end customers and could harm our reputation with other potential end customers. As we expand our operations internationally, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support, training and documentation in languages other than English. Our failure or the failure of our channel partners to maintain high-quality support and services could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIf we are unable to develop, offer and deliver new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread market acceptance, or if we are unable to continually improve the performance, features, and reliability of our existing products and services, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nRapid technological changes, as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences, characterize the software industry. Just as the transition from mainframes to personal computers transformed the industry, we believe our industry may transform in response to continued adoption of mobile devices and cloud services, growth of big data, and potential emergence of capabilities resulting from disruptive innovation. In response, we have devoted significant resources to the development of new solutions, such as our cloud-based and secure content mobility services. We are making such investments through our internal efforts, including further development and enhancement of our existing products, as well as through potential acquisitions of new product lines. Innovation, new product development or acquisition, and go-to-market activities involve a significant commitment of time and resources and are subject to a number of risks and challenges including:\n\u2022\nDeveloping, sustaining, and appropriately leveraging market intelligence to identify areas of market need that offer potentially high return on investment for solution development.\n\u2022\nManaging the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements, which may be longer than originally expected.\n\u2022\nAdapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers.\n\u2022\nAddressing the evolution of operating systems and industry platforms that presently may not be served by our existing products.\n\u2022\nEntering into new or unproven markets with which we have limited experience.\n\u2022\nManaging new product and service strategies, including integrating our various security and file replication technologies, management solutions, customer service, and support into unified enterprise security and file replication solutions.\n\u2022\nIncorporating acquired products and technologies acquired through mergers, acquisitions or other relationships with third-parties.\n\u2022\nDeveloping or expanding efficient sales channels.\n\u2022\nObtaining sufficient licenses to technology and technical access from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to enable the development and deployment of interoperable products, including source code licenses for certain products with deep technical integration into operating systems.\nInvestments in new products may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs or may cause short or long-term harm to our financial results. For example, customer adoption of our cloud and mobile computing services may not occur as rapidly as anticipated, or competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers, adversely affecting our competitive position, or we may not be successful in future attempts to achieve disruptive innovation.\nFurther, given the rapid speed of changing customer expectations and advancement of technology inherent in the software industry, the extensive and complex efforts required to create useful and widely accepted products and the rapid evolution of cloud computing, mobile devices, new computing platforms and other technologies, our executive management team must act quickly, continuously and with vision. Although we have articulated a strategy that we believe will fulfill these challenges, if we fail to execute properly on that strategy, adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve, or fail to internalize and execute on that strategy, we may fail to meet our customers\u2019 expectations, fail to compete with our competitors\u2019 products and technology and lose the confidence of our channel partners and employees. This in turn could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nWe earn the large majority of our revenue and operating margins from our Enhanced File Transfer, licensed software solution suite and related maintenance and support services and, as a result, are highly dependent upon the continued success of this product line.\nOur Enhanced File Transfer solution, or EFT, is one of our on-premises, managed file transfer solutions targeted primarily to the enterprise and small and medium business user environments. License and M&S revenue from this product line was responsible for 80% of our total revenue in 2014 and has provided substantially all of our recent revenue growth and most of the operating margin necessary to fund our operations including, most notably, our sales and marketing and research and development activities. Declines and variability in demand for the EFT solution could occur as a result of:\n\u2022\nImproved products or product versions being offered by competitors in our markets.\n\u2022\nCompetitive pricing pressures.\n\u2022\nFailure to release new or enhanced versions of the EFT solution on a timely basis, or at all.\n\u2022\nTechnological change that we are unable to address with file transfer products or that changes the way enterprises utilize our products.\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions.\nDue to our product concentration, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows would therefore be adversely affected by a decline in demand for the EFT solution suite.\nWe may not achieve our expected future financial results from our Mail Express, Wide Area File Services, CuteFTP and TappIn product lines or from our professional services.\nRevenue from our products and services other than the EFT solution accounted for 20% of our total revenue in 2014, which is a decline from 21% in 2013 and 22% in 2012. Improving, and possibly even sustaining, our financial results is dependent upon achieving additional success in the marketplace with our products and services that complement and supplement our EFT solution suite. These products include CuteFTP, Mail Express, WAFS, and TappIn and our professional services. These solutions involve serving markets that in some ways differ from the markets we encounter when selling EFT software and M&S. Gaining additional traction in such markets will require that we market, sell, and support these solutions effectively. Each of these success factors has inherent risks due to, for example, evolving corporate expertise in the adjacent markets and the possibility that the specific buyers of solutions in these adjacent markets may be different from the buyers with whom we interact throughout our traditional EFT solution sales cycle. Entering, obtaining traction, and sustaining growth in these markets requires investments in engineering, marketing, sales, customer support, and internal business systems. If we do not effectively penetrate these markets, or if the resources necessary to effectively address these markets exceed our expectations, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe may engage third parties to develop products on our behalf. These engagements may involve reliance on resources owned and managed by those third parties over which we have no direct control.\nIn addition to researching and developing new products ourselves, we engage third parties to conceive, design and develop products on our behalf. Arrangements of this type involve high levels of risk due to inherent uncertainties about the timely delivery and ultimate viability of those products due to the reliance we must place on third parties to plan, perform and successfully complete work for us. These are processes for which we could have notably less direct control than if we performed the work ourselves. These arrangements also involve us relying on the ongoing financial viability of the enterprise performing the work. This risk is challenging to manage because we do not always have clear visibility as to the overall condition of the third-party enterprise. These risks could result in the product not being successfully completed within the expected timeframe, or at all. If actual results from these type endeavors we may undertake in the future differ materially from original and ongoing expectations, our business, operating results and financial position could be harmed.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue.\nWe believe there are significant seasonal factors that may cause us to record higher revenue in some quarters compared with others. We believe this variability is largely due to our customers\u2019 budgetary and spending patterns, as many customers spend the unused portions of their discretionary budgets prior to the end of their fiscal years. For example, we have historically recorded our highest level of revenue in our fourth quarter, which we believe corresponds to the fourth quarter of a majority of our customers. If our rate of growth slows over time, seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced, and our business, results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.\nOur sales cycles can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, our sales and revenue are difficult to predict and may vary substantially from period to period, which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate, in part, because of the resource intensive nature of our sales efforts, the length and variability of our sales cycle, and the short-term difficulty in adjusting our operating expenses. Our results of operations depend in part on sales to large organizations. The length of our sales cycle, from proof of concept to delivery of and payment for our platform, is typically three to nine months but can be more than a year. To the extent our competitors develop products that our prospective customers view as equivalent to ours, our average sales cycle may increase. Because the length of time required to close a sale varies substantially from customer to customer, it is difficult to accurately predict when, or even if, we will make a sale with a potential customer. As a result, large individual sales have, in some cases, occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated, or have not occurred at all. The loss or delay of one or more large transactions in a quarter could impact our results of operations for that quarter and any future quarters for which revenue from that transaction is delayed. As a result of these factors, it is difficult for us to forecast accurately our revenue for any quarter or other period in the future. Because a substantial portion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term, our results of operations will suffer if our revenue falls below expectations in a particular quarter, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nReliance on shipments at the end of each quarter could cause our revenue for the applicable period to fall below expected levels.\nAs a result of customer buying patterns and the efforts of our sales force and channel partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives, we have historically received a substantial portion of sales orders and generated a substantial portion of revenue during the last few weeks of each quarter. A significant interruption in our IT systems, which manage critical functions such as order processing, revenue recognition, financial forecasts, inventory and supply chain management, and trade compliance reviews, could result in delayed order fulfillment and decreased revenue for that quarter. If expected revenue at the end of any quarter is delayed for any reason, including the failure of anticipated purchase orders to materialize, our logistics or channel partners\u2019 inability to deliver products prior to quarter-end to fulfill purchase orders received near the end of the quarter, our inability to release new products on schedule, any failure of our systems related to order review and processing, or any delays in shipments based on trade compliance requirements, our revenue for that quarter could fall below our expectations and the estimates of market analysts, if any, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations and cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nOur ability to develop our software will be seriously impaired if we are not able to use our foreign subcontractors.\nWe rely on foreign subcontractors to help us develop some aspects of some of our software. If these programmers decided to stop working for us, or if we were unable to continue using them because of political or economic instability, we would have difficulty finding comparably skilled developers in a timely manner. In addition, we would likely have to pay considerably more for the same work, especially if we used U.S. personnel. If we could not replace the contract programmers, it could take us significantly longer to develop certain products and product upgrades and at a higher cost.\nOur subscription services, such as our Managed Information Xchange and Hosted Enhanced File Transfer solutions, may impact our revenue trends as some opportunities that otherwise would have materialized as software license sales could potentially shift to subscription-based sales.\nMuch of our revenue growth in recent years has been attributable to license and maintenance and support sales of our EFT solution. License fees for software to be installed at a customer site, such as our EFT solution, are typically recognized in full as revenue at the time the software is delivered to the customer. Subscription services, on the other hand, are recognized as revenue over time as the services are delivered (assuming collection is deemed probable), typically on a monthly basis. Therefore, only a ratable portion of the total value of a subscription services sale is recognized as revenue each month with the remainder recorded as deferred revenue. Any significant increase in the percentage of our business generated from such a subscription model could, as a result, delay revenue recognition and have a negative impact on our operating results.\nThe impact of subscription services on prior revenue growth trends depends on several key factors, including the number of customers who may shift from software licenses to subscription services, the rate at which they may do so, the subscription term and fees, and the comparative value of the opportunity had it materialized as a software license sale instead of as a subscription service. Generally, for a fixed number of opportunities (that is, without considering the possibility that a new service offering may result in additional sales opportunities), addition of subscription services reduces revenue growth rates for several quarters for the associated solutions until cumulative subscription revenue increases and, potentially, surpasses comparable software license revenue. The revenue impacts are particularly pronounced early in the introduction of subscription services because there has been only a short time period for accumulation of the recurring revenue stream. As we continue to promote subscription-based services, the risk of this revenue shift will continue with revenue derived from sales of our EFT solution, the comparable on-premises MFT software in our portfolio, most subject to ongoing transitory risk from the introduction of these subscription services. However, to date, we have seen no material impact from this potential revenue shift in light of the continued strength of our EFT sales and the pace at which our managed and hosted products and services have gained market acceptance.\nSubscription offerings create risks related to the timing of revenue recognition.\nAlthough the subscription model is designed to increase the number of customers who purchase our products and services and create a recurring revenue stream that is more predictable, it creates certain risks related to the timing of revenue recognition and potential reductions in cash flows.\nA portion of the subscription-based revenue we report each quarter results from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreements entered into during previous quarters. A decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any period may not be immediately reflected in our reported financial results for that period but may result in a decline in our revenue in future quarters. If we were to experience significant downturns in subscription sales and renewal rates, our reported financial results might not reflect such downturns until future periods. Our subscription model could also make it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenues from subscription or SaaS-based services through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers will be recognized over the applicable subscription term. Increases in sales under our subscription sales model could result in decreased revenues over the short term if they are offset by a decline in sales from perpetual license customers.\nOur cloud and SaaS offerings bring new business and operational risks.\nWe have several products that provide secure file transfer and mobile computing solutions that we deliver using a SaaS model. Our SaaS offerings provide our customers with existing and new software management through a hosted service as opposed to traditional software deployments. There can be no assurance that SaaS revenue will be significant in the future despite our levels of investment in developing this product delivery method. Margins associated with our SaaS offerings are generally lower than margins associated with our on-premise solutions.\nOur customers may not renew their subscriptions after the expiration of their subscription agreements and in fact, some customers elect not to do so. Our customers may opt for a lower-priced edition of our offerings or for fewer subscriptions. Renewal rates in the future may differ from historical trends such that we may not be able to accurately predict customer renewal rates. Our customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our services and their ability to continue their operations and spending levels. If we experience a decline in the renewal rates for our customers or they opt for lower-priced editions of our offerings or fewer subscriptions, our operating results may be adversely impacted.\nThere is a risk that our customer support teams could find it difficult or costly to support both traditional software installed by customers and software delivered as a service. To the extent that our SaaS offerings are defective or there are disruptions to our services, demand for our SaaS offerings could diminish, and we could be subject to substantial liability.\nInterruptions or delays in service from our third party service delivery hosts could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business. If we or our third party service delivery hosts experience security breaches and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data or our data, our services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our services and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nOur success with our SaaS solutions depends on organizations and customers perceiving technological and operational benefits and cost savings associated with the increasing adoption of virtual infrastructure solutions for on-premise data centers. Concerns about security, privacy, availability, data integrity, retention and ownership may negatively impact the rate of adoption of these solutions. SaaS software solutions can be complex, and the deployment of our secure file transfer solutions in that manner may require additional professional services and implementation services for which we may not have the ability to provide at an appropriate margin. Our SaaS products are dependent upon third party hardware, software and hosting vendors, all of which must interoperate for end users to achieve their computing goals. We expect other companies to enter this market and to introduce their own initiatives that may compete with, or not be compatible with, our cloud solutions.\nIf any of these events were to occur, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on third parties to provide us with a number of operational services, including hosting and delivery, certain of our customer services and other operations. Any interruption or delay in service from these third parties, breaches of security or privacy, or failures in data collection could expose us to liability, harm our reputation and adversely impact our financial performance.\nWe rely on hosted computer services from third parties for certain services that we provide our customers. As we gather customer data and host certain customer data in third-party facilities, a security breach could compromise the integrity or availability or result in the theft of customer data. In addition, our operations could be negatively affected in the event of a security breach, and we could be subject to the loss or theft of confidential or proprietary information.\nUnauthorized access to this data may be obtained through break-ins, breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party, employee theft or misuse, or other misconduct. We rely on a number of third party suppliers in the operation of our business for the provisioning of various services and materials that we use in the production of our products. Although we seek to diversify our third party suppliers, we may from time to time rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, or upon suppliers in a single country, for these services or materials. The inability of such third parties to satisfy our requirements could disrupt our business operations or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy. If any of these situations were to occur, our reputation could be harmed, we could be subject to third party liability, including under data protection and privacy laws in certain jurisdictions, and our financial performance could be negatively impacted.\nFluctuations in professional services revenue may be greater than experienced in previous reporting periods and have a disproportionate impact on our financial results. For example, increased professional services sales, especially to the government, may result in lower earnings as a percentage of revenue.\nOur solution portfolio includes software licenses, subscription services, and professional services. Because they are relatively labor intensive, professional services typically have substantially lower margins than software license sales, maintenance and support sales and SaaS solutions. However, professional services represent a strategic capability that helps customers plan, implement, and sustain our solutions and also provide us with the demonstrated past performance necessary to participate in certain procurements. Professional services were 5% of our total revenue in 2014. However, this percentage can fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on the needs of our customers.\nDepending on our mix of software licenses, subscription, and professional services revenue in a given reporting period, our earnings as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate from historical norms. For example, if we were to derive a relatively large (compared to historical norms) component of our revenue from professional services in a reporting period, earnings as a percentage of revenue may decline in that period due to lower margin contribution from the labor-intensive services as compared to software license and subscription service revenue.\nAn inability to establish vendor specific objective evidence of the selling price of one or more components of a software sale with multiple components could result in our having to change from recognizing software license revenue in full at the time the software is delivered to recognizing that same software license revenue ratably in the future over an extended number of accounting periods.\nFor software sales with multiple components (typically a sale involving both a license to software that will be delivered immediately and M&S that will be delivered over an extended period of time), generally accepted accounting principles require that vendor specific objective evidence of selling price (\u201cVSOE\u201d) be established for at least all but one of the components of that sale before the software license revenue can be recognized in full at the time of delivery to the customer. If VSOE cannot be established, recognition of the software license revenue must deferred and recognized ratably in the future over an extended number of accounting periods, the length of which would typically be the time period covered by the related M&S contract. We currently have established VSOE in a manner that supports our recognizing software license revenue in full at the time we deliver the software to our customers for substantially all of our products.\nSituations can arise where a change in product pricing that improves our cash flow and financial position has an unintended consequence of our not being able to establish VSOE where it existed before. If that set of circumstances were to occur, we could be required by generally accepted accounting principles to defer recognition of software license revenue to future periods. That requirement could cause us to experience an immediate decline in software license revenue recognized in our financial statements in the period in which the licensed software was delivered to our customer even though the timing and amount of cash flow from the transaction would be the same as when we had established VSOE. If this collection of events were to occur, it could have a material, adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations and financial condition we present in our financial statements.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively with larger, better-positioned companies, resulting in lower margins and loss of market share.\nWe operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments, market consolidation, changes in industry standards, changes in customer requirements, and frequent new product introductions and product improvements by existing and new competitors. If we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors take or gain additional market share in any of our markets, our competitive position could weaken, and we could experience a decrease in revenues that could adversely affect our business and operating results. To compete successfully, we must maintain a successful research and development effort to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services, effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors, appropriately respond to competitor strategies as such strategies become apparent, and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed, used, and stored within our enterprise and consumer markets. If we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands, we could experience a negative effect on our competitive position and our financial results.\nWe compete with a variety of companies who have significantly greater revenues and financial resources, more partners, resellers and distribution channels than we have and greater quantities of personnel and technical resources. For example, our EFT solution suite competes with products from IBM Sterling, Ipswitch, Axway and several other vendors. Our WAFS product competes with Riverbed Technology and Cisco. TappIn competes with a variety of cloud file storage and collaboration companies such as Dropbox. Large companies may be able to develop new technologies, across multiple solution spaces, and on more operating systems, more quickly than we can, to offer a broader array of products, and to respond more quickly to new opportunities, industry standards or customer requirements.\nAdditional competitors may enter the market and also may have significantly greater capabilities and resources than we do. Some existing competitors also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing strategies. For example, Ipswitch provides an older version of its consumer file transfer protocol program for free for non-commercial use, and Microsoft includes file transfer protocol functionality in its Internet browser, which it also distributes for free. Increased competition may result in lower operating margins and loss of market share.\nAs we attempt to expand our business, our operating expenses may increase, and we may incur losses.\nWe intend to expand our business, specifically with regard to new license sales of our products. To do so, we plan to increase our research and development expenditures to accelerate our introduction of new features, functions and capabilities for our products to the marketplace. We intend to enhance the presence and visibility of those products by increasing our sales and marketing expenditures to expand our sales force, particularly through a broader reseller program involving more third-parties, and by implementing new sales lead generation and marketing initiatives.\nThese expanded research and development and sales and marketing activities may result in an increase in our operating expenses. If we do not successfully develop new features, functions and capabilities for our products in a manner that increases license sales of our products, and if our enhanced sales and marketing activities, including expansion of our third-party reseller programs, are not successful, our revenue may not increase. In that event, our net income could decline or we may incur losses.\nOur products are complex and operate in a wide variety of computer configurations, which could result in errors or product failures.\nAddressing MFT, file synchronization, managed email attachment, hosted services and secure content mobility typically requires very complex products. Undetected errors, failures, or bugs may occur, especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released. Our products are often installed and used in large-scale computing environments with different operating systems, system management software, and equipment and networking configurations, which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors, failures, or bugs in our products. Our customers\u2019 computing environments also are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and non-standard configurations that make pre-release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time-consuming. In addition, despite testing by us and others, errors, failures, or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments. In the past, we have discovered software errors, failures, and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and have experienced delayed or lost revenues during the time required to correct these errors.\nErrors, failures, or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity, product returns, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, loss of competitive position, or claims by customers or others. Many of our end-user customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other, less critical, software products. In addition, if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity or availability occurs in one of our end-user customer\u2019s systems, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed. Alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions, delays, or cessation of our product licensing, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business is subject to the risks of warranty claims, product returns, product liability and product defects.\nReal or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our products could result in claims by customers for losses that they sustain. If customers make these types of claims, we may be required, or may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources in order to help correct the problem. Liability provisions in our standard terms and conditions of sale, and those of our resellers and distributors, may not be enforceable under some circumstances or may not fully or effectively protect us from customer claims and related liabilities and costs, including indemnification obligations under our agreements with resellers and distributors. The sale and support of our products also entail the risk of product liability claims. We maintain insurance to protect against certain types of claims associated with the use of our products, but our insurance coverage may not adequately cover any such claims. Even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in expenditures of funds in connection with litigation and divert management\u2019s time and other resources.\nPossible future acquisitions give rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect our future financial results.\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks and challenges, including:\n\u00b7\nComplexity, time, and costs associated with integration of the acquired business operations, workforce, products, and technologies into our existing business, sales force, employee base, product lines, marketing and technology. The possibility exists that such integration ultimately may not be successful.\n\u00b7\nDiversion of management time and attention from our existing business and other business opportunities throughout the integration.\n\u00b7\nPotential loss or termination of employees, including costs associated with the termination or replacement of those employees.\n\u00b7\nAssumption of debt or other liabilities of the acquired business, including any future litigation related to alleged liabilities of the acquired business.\n\u00b7\nThe incurrence of additional acquisition-related debt as well as increased expenses and working capital requirements.\n\u00b7\nPotential dilution of earnings per share.\n\u00b7\nIncreased costs and efforts in connection with compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\u00b7\nPotentially substantial accounting charges for restructuring and related expenses, write-off of in-process research and development, impairment of goodwill, amortization of intangible assets, and share-based compensation expense.\nThe ongoing integration of any acquired business, involves continually determining and leveraging the actual market synergies, sustaining and even extending the business performance of the acquired entity, implementing our technology systems in the acquired operations and integrating and managing the personnel of the acquired operations. We also must continue to effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own culture in a way that aligns various interests.\nAny of the foregoing, and other factors, could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of financial performance or to realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition. In addition, because acquisitions of technology companies are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that our previous, current, or future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition.\nTurmoil and uncertainty in U.S. and international economic markets could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nDemand for our products depends in large part upon the level of capital and maintenance expenditures by many of our customers. Economic downturns could have an adverse effect on spending on information technology projects since in such environments, prospects and customers may reduce, sometimes greatly, their discretionary spending to focus on preserving mandatory spending budgets.\nThese adverse impacts to customer spending may be directly, and adversely, reflected in our future business and operating results because we believe a substantial part of the MFT spending budget is considered discretionary by our prospects and customers. The perception of MFT solutions spending as discretionary is further reinforced by the existence of low cost, or even free, products that deliver some subset of the capabilities found in our solutions. In the event of an economic downturn, some customers may decide to defer spending for our solutions or may elect to obtain low cost or free \u201cgood enough\u201d products as an interim measure. The potential adverse impacts of such decisions may persist for an extended period of time, even well into a period of economic recovery, given that many prospects will not change their IT infrastructure for a considerable period of time after that infrastructure has been installed and is operating adequately.\nAdverse financial results from another economic downturn and uncertainty could include flat, or even decreasing, sales, lower gross and net margins, and impairment of current or future goodwill and long-lived assets. In addition, some of our customers could delay paying their obligations to us. Potentially reduced sales and margins and customer payment problems could limit our ability to fund research and development, marketing, sales, and other activities necessary to sustain and expand our market position.\nIn past economic downturns, we have sometimes experienced a decrease in our stock price. If investors have concerns that our business, financial condition and results of operations will be negatively impacted by another economic downturn, our stock price could decrease again.\nRegardless of economic conditions, fluctuations in demand for our products and services are driven by many factors and a decrease in demand for our products could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to a variety of factors, including competition, product obsolescence, technological change, budget constraints of our actual and potential customers, awareness of security threats to IT systems, and other factors. While such factors may, in some periods, increase product sales, fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our product sales. If demand for our products declines, our revenues, as well as our gross and net margins, could be adversely affected. CuteFTP, in particular, competes in some ways with social media services for image and video sharing. As social media has increased in popularity, sales of our CuteFTP product line have declined.\nSales to the U.S. Government make up a portion of our business and changes in government defense spending could have consequences on our financial position, results of operations and business.\nOur revenues from the U.S. Government largely result from contracts awarded to us under various U.S. Government programs, primarily defense-related programs with the Department of Defense (\u201cDoD\u201d). The funding of our programs is subject to the overall U.S. Government foreign policy, budget and appropriation decisions, and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events and macroeconomic conditions, and are beyond our control. Projected defense spending budgets are uncertain and difficult to predict.\nSignificant changes in defense spending could have long-term consequences for our size and structure. Changes in government priorities and requirements could impact the funding, or the timing of funding, of our programs which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. Government contracts typically have long sales cycles such that closure of such contracts is difficult to predict.\nU.S. Government contracts generally also permit the government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, without prior notice, at the government\u2019s convenience or for default based on performance. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. Furthermore, on contracts for which we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, irrespective of our performance as a subcontractor.\nBecause we are a DoD contractor, certain of our items and/or transactions may be subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d) if our software or services are specifically designed or modified for defense purposes. Companies engaged in manufacturing or exporting ITAR-controlled goods and services (even if these companies do not export such items) are required to register with the U.S. State Department. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines and sanctions which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges to our sales organization can be disruptive and may negatively impact our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we make significant changes in the organizational structure and compensation plans of our sales organization, which may increase the risk of sales personnel turnover. To the extent that we experience turnover within our direct sales force or sales management, there is a risk that the productivity of our sales force would be negatively impacted which could lead to revenue declines. Turnover within our sales force can cause disruption in sales cycles leading to delay or loss of business. It can take time to implement new sales management plans and to effectively recruit and train new sales representatives. We review and modify our compensation plans for the sales organization periodically. Changes to our sales compensation plans could make it difficult for us to attract and retain top sales talent.\nIf we are unable to generate significant volumes of sales leads from our various marketing and demand generation efforts then our revenue may not grow as expected or may decline.\nWe generate leads through various marketing activities such as targeted email campaigns, attending networking-based trade shows, purchasing information and services from third-party experts in generating leads, and hosting webinars on enterprise IT management issues. Our marketing efforts may be unsuccessful resulting in fewer sales leads. If we fail to generate a sufficient volume of leads from these activities and/or such sales leads do not result in actual sales, our revenue may not grow as expected or could decrease and our operating results could suffer\nSome of our sales leads are generated through visits to our websites by potential end-users interested in purchasing or downloading evaluations of our products. Many of these potential end-users find our websites by searching for secure file transfer products through Internet search engines, such as Google. A critical factor in attracting potential customers to our websites is how prominently our websites are displayed in response to search inquiries. If we are listed less prominently or fail to appear in search result listings for any reason, visits to our websites by customers and potential customers could decline significantly. We may not be able to replace this traffic, and, if we attempt to replace this traffic, we may be required to increase our sales and marketing expenses, which may not be offset by additional revenue and could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to their customers, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe sell our products to customers through our direct sales force and third-party resellers. Sales through these different channels involve distinct risks, including the following:\nDirect Sales. Risks associated with direct sales include:\n\u00b7\nChallenges in scaling the size of the direct sales team to levels required for revenue growth\n\u00b7\nDifficulty in hiring, retaining, and motivating our direct sales force;\n\u00b7\nSubstantial amounts of training for sales representatives to become productive, including regular updates to cover new and revised products; and\n\u00b7\nLeads obtained from paid advertising (for example, Google ads) impacting direct sales should the marketing and advertising effectiveness decline due to non-attributable declines in leads, unforeseen search engine algorithm changes, or other occurrences that may adversely impact the lead generation aspects of the direct sales cycle. Increased competition may materially impact the costs associated with such marketing and advertising.\nIndirect Sales Channels. This channel that involves sales through third-party resellers involves a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7\nOur lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to end-users;\n\u00b7\nOur resellers and distributors currently not being subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers;\n\u00b7\nOur reseller and distributor agreements generally being nonexclusive and terminable at any time without cause; and\n\u00b7\nOur resellers and distributors frequently marketing and distributing competing products and, from time to time, placing greater emphasis on the sale of these products due to pricing, promotions, and other terms offered by our competitors.\nWe cannot be certain that our third-party resellers will continue to market or sell our products effectively. If we are not successful, we may lose sales opportunities, customers and revenues.\nIf we lose key personnel we may not be able to execute our business plan.\nOur future success depends on the continued services of key members of our management team. These individuals are difficult to replace because of the intense competition for similarly skilled people. New members of the management team may not be productive for weeks or months as they learn about our solutions, our personnel and the administrative practices within our company.\nIt may be difficult for us to recruit and retain software developers and other technical and management personnel because we are a relatively small company.\nWe compete intensely with other software development and distribution companies internationally and information technology departments supporting larger businesses to recruit and hire from a limited pool of qualified personnel. Some qualified candidates prefer to work for larger, better known companies or in another geographic area. In order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace, we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash and equity-based compensation. The volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees. In addition, we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans. Also, accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of employee stock options and other forms of equity-based compensation as compensation expense. As a result, we may decide to issue fewer equity-based incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel. If we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees, or conversely, if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nKey personnel have left our company in the past. There likely will be additional departures of key personnel from time to time in the future. The loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations, including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases, the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, and the results of our operations. Hiring, training, and successfully integrating replacement sales, engineering, and other personnel could be time consuming, may cause additional disruptions to our operations, and may be unsuccessful, which could negatively impact future revenues.\nOur operations potentially are vulnerable to security breaches that could harm the quality of our products and services or disrupt our ability to deliver our products and services.\nInformation security is a dynamic discipline that historically has faced a threat that develops and emerges in sometimes-unpredictable ways. Third parties may breach our system and information security and damage our products and services or misappropriate confidential customer information. This might cause us to lose customers, or even cause customers to make claims against us for damages. We may be required to expend significant resources to protect against potential or actual security breaches and/or to address problems caused by such breaches.\nImproper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation.\nWhile we have derived the majority of our historical revenues from on-premise delivery of our products, we now also offer our products on third party hosted platforms. As we continue to execute our strategy of increasing the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers. At the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. This environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls. It is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information. Improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. We believe consumers using our subscription services increasingly will want efficient, centralized methods of choosing their privacy preferences and controlling their data. Perceptions that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could constrain consumer and business adoption of cloud-based solutions.\nBreaches of our cybersecurity systems could degrade our ability to conduct our business operations and deliver products and services to our customers, delay our ability to recognize revenue, compromise the integrity of our software products, result in significant data losses and the theft of our intellectual property, damage our reputation, expose us to liability to third parties and require us to incur significant additional costs to maintain the security of our networks and data.\nWe increasingly depend upon our IT systems to conduct virtually all of our business operations, ranging from our internal operations and product development activities to our marketing and sales efforts and communications with our customers and business partners. Cyber threats may attempt to penetrate our network security, or that of our website, and misappropriate our proprietary information or cause interruptions of our service. Because the techniques used by such attackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. We have also outsourced a number of our business functions to third party contractors. Therefore, our business operations also depend, in part, on the success of our contractors' own cybersecurity measures. Similarly, we rely upon distributors, resellers, system vendors and systems integrators to sell our products and our sales operations depend, in part, on the reliability of their cybersecurity measures. Additionally, we depend upon our employees to appropriately handle confidential data and deploy our IT resources in safe and secure fashion that does not expose our network systems to security breaches and the loss of data. Accordingly, if our cybersecurity systems and those of our contractors fail to protect against unauthorized access, sophisticated cyber-attacks and the mishandling of data by our employees and contractors, our ability to conduct our business effectively could be damaged in a number of ways, including:\n\u00b7\nSensitive data regarding our business, including intellectual property and other proprietary data, could be stolen;\n\u00b7\nOur electronic communications systems, including email and other methods, could be disrupted, and our ability to conduct our business operations could be seriously damaged until such systems can be restored;\n\u00b7\nOur ability to process customer orders and electronically deliver products and services could be degraded, and our distribution channels could be disrupted, resulting in delays in revenue recognition;\n\u00b7\nDefects and security vulnerabilities could be introduced into our software products, thereby damaging the reputation and perceived reliability and security of our products and potentially making the data systems of our customers vulnerable to further data loss and cyber incidents; and\n\u00b7\nPersonally identifiable data of our customers, employees and business partners could be lost.\nShould any of the above events occur, we could be subject to significant claims for liability from our customers, regulatory actions from governmental agencies, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could be compromised and our reputation and competitive position could be significantly harmed. Also, the regulatory and contractual actions, litigations, investigations, fines, penalties and liabilities relating to data breaches that result in losses of personally identifiable or credit card information of users of our services can be significant in terms of fines and reputational impact and necessitate changes to our business operations that may be disruptive to us. Additionally, we could incur significant costs in order to upgrade our cybersecurity systems and remediate damages. Consequently, our financial performance and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nCertain components of the software code comprising some of our products are licensed from third parties making us dependent upon those licenses remaining in place for those products to operate in their current form.\nCertain key components of the software code comprising certain of our products are licensed from unrelated, third parties. These licenses are not perpetual such that, with advance notice as provided in the license agreements, those third parties could terminate those licenses. Even with advance notice, termination of those licenses could create a severe hardship for us due to the need to locate substitute software code from other third parties or create alternative software code ourselves in order for our products to continue to operate in the manner designed or for us to keep pace with customer requirements, including our obligations under maintenance and support agreements. There is no assurance we could achieve either of those alternative solutions in a timely and effective manner that would not disrupt our ability to continue selling and supporting those products, or without the consumption of significant company resources in the form of time spent by our personnel creating alternative solutions or cash paid to third parties to assist us. Such a situation could delay the completion and introduction to the marketplace of other products we are developing to remain competitive due to the diversion of the attention of certain of our key personnel away from that work. If any of these events occur, our future business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe utilize \u201copen source\u201d software in some of our products.\nThe open source software community develops software technology for free use by anyone. We incorporate a limited amount of open source code software into our products. We may use more open source code software in the future.\nOur use, in some instances, of open source code software may impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our solutions and may subject us to possible intellectual property litigation. Open source code may impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products because, among other reasons, open source license terms may be ambiguous and may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our solution, and open source software cannot be protected under trade secret law. In addition, it may be difficult for us to accurately determine the developers of the open source code and whether the acquired software infringes third-party intellectual property rights. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. From time to time, companies that incorporate open source software into their products have been subject to such claims.\nClaims of infringement or misappropriation against us could be costly for us to defend and could require us to re-engineer our solution or to seek to obtain licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our solution. We also might need to discontinue the sale of our solution in the event re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely or cost-effective basis. If any such claim, attempted remediation, or solution discontinuance occur, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nOur products may expose customers to invasion of privacy, causing customer dissatisfaction.\nOur products and solutions are intended to facilitate data and information transfer and sharing, sometimes by providing outsiders access to a customer\u2019s computer. Such access potentially may make the customer vulnerable to security breaches, which could result in the loss of their privacy or property. Invasions of privacy or other customer harm occurring in an environment where our solutions are operating could result in customer dissatisfaction and possible claims against us for any resulting damages.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nAll products that are exported, re-exported or that are worked on by foreign nationals are subject to export controls. Such controls include prohibitions on end uses, end users and exports to certain sanctioned countries. In addition, incorporation of encryption technology into our products increases the level of U.S. export controls. We are subject to these requirements as certain of our products include the ability for the end user to encrypt data. Therefore, our products may be exported outside the United States or revealed to foreign nationals only by complying with the required level of export controls/restrictions. Restrictions applicable to our products may include a requirement to have a license to export the technology, a requirement to have software licenses approved before export is allowed and outright bans on the licensing of certain encryption technology to particular end users or to all end users in a particular country. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain technology and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our products in those countries.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining or maintaining the licenses and other authorizations required to export our products from applicable government authorities. Any change in export or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the list of countries to which we cannot export, changes in persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Changes in our products or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries altogether. Any change in export or import regulations or related legislation, shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations.\nExport laws and regulations can be extremely complex in their application. If we are found not to have complied with applicable export control laws, we may be sanctioned, fined or penalized by, among other things, having our ability to obtain export licenses curtailed or eliminated, possibly for an extended period of time. Our failure to receive or maintain any required export licenses or authorizations or our penalization for failure to comply with applicable export control laws would hinder our ability to sell our products, could result in financial penalties, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any failure on our part or the part of our distributors to comply with encryption or other applicable export control requirements could harm our business and operating results.\nImport and export regulations of encryption/decryption technology vary from country to country. We may be subject to different statutory or regulatory controls in different foreign jurisdictions, and as such, importation of our technology may not be permitted in these foreign jurisdictions. Violations of foreign regulations or regulation of international transactions could prevent us from being able to sell our products in international markets. Our success depends in large part to having access to international markets. A violation of foreign regulations could limit our access to such markets and have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nAs our international sales grow, we could become increasingly subject to additional risks that could harm our business.\nWe conduct significant sales and customer support, in countries outside of the United States. During the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 28% of our sales were to purchasers outside the United States. Our continued growth and profitability could require us to further expand our international operations. To successfully expand international sales, we must establish additional foreign operations, hire additional personnel and recruit additional international resellers. We may also incur additional expense translating our applications into additional languages. In addition, there is significant competition for entry into high growth markets. Our international operations are subject to a variety of risks, which could cause fluctuations in the results of our international operations. These risks include:\n\u00b7\nCompliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements.\n\u00b7\nVariability of foreign economic, political and labor conditions.\n\u00b7\nChanging restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements, tariffs or other trade barriers or by U.S. export laws.\n\u00b7\nLonger accounts receivable payment cycles.\n\u00b7\nPotentially adverse tax consequences.\n\u00b7\nDifficulties in protecting intellectual property.\n\u00b7\nBurdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.\n\u00b7\nDifficulty transferring funds to the U.S. in a tax efficient manner from non-U.S jurisdictions in which the cash flow originates.\nWe are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally which may harm our business.\nWe are a global company subject to varied and complex laws, regulations and customs domestically and internationally. These laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade protection, import and export control, data and transaction processing security, payment card industry data security standards, records management, user-generated content hosted on websites we operate, corporate governance, employee and third-party complaints, gift policies, conflicts of interest, employment and labor relations laws, securities regulations and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. The application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and may at times conflict. Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. Non-compliance could also result in fines, damages, or criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. We incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our global operations and could become subject to legal penalties if we fail to comply with local laws and regulations in U.S. jurisdictions or in foreign countries, which laws and regulations may be substantially different from those in the U.S. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our internal policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to maintain proper and effective internal controls could affect our ability to produce accurate financial statements which could result in the restatement of our financial statements or adversely affect our operating results, our ability to operate our business, and our stock price.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. We maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, which is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures, it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, result in the restatement of our financial statements, harm our operating results, subject us to regulatory scrutiny and sanction, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, and have a negative effect on the market price for shares of our common stock.\nThe amount of income taxes we compute as payable on our income tax returns filed with the Internal Revenue Service and certain states could be challenged by those taxing authorities resulting in us paying more taxes than anticipated.\nWe file income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and taxing authorities in certain states. We prepare and file those returns based on our interpretations of the relevant tax code as to revenue to be reported and deductions and credits allowed. We use third-party experts to assist us in preparing our tax returns and computing our tax liabilities to help us ensure we pay the proper amount of tax due. Our tax returns are subject to examination by taxing authorities who could interpret the tax code in a different manner from us and conclude we are obligated to pay more taxes than we originally computed and paid. While we would defend the position taken on our tax returns as filed, a challenge from a taxing authority can be costly to defend with no assurance of a favorable outcome for us. In the event of an unfavorable result under these circumstances, our business, operating results and financial position could be harmed.\nThe amount of sales tax we collect on sales could be challenged by taxing authorities both in jurisdictions in which we have a corporate presence as well as by taxing authorities in areas where we have no corporate presence.\nWe collect and remit sales tax on sales in jurisdictions where we have a corporate or physical presence that results in an obligation to do so. We sell our products to customers in numerous locations where we do not have a corporate or physical presence and, therefore, do not collect sales tax on those sales. States in which we collect sales tax could audit our activities and assess us with additional tax based on them interpreting the sales tax code differently than we interpret it. Various states in which we do not collect sales tax are aggressive in interpreting their sales tax codes in determining if a company with no apparent presence in those states is obligated to collect and remit sales taxes, particularly on sales made across the Internet. States where we do not collect sales tax could make an assertion that we should have been collecting sales tax and could assess us with that tax. While we would defend the position taken as to our obligation to collect sales tax and the amount of sales tax collected, a challenge from a taxing authority can be costly to defend with no assurance of a favorable outcome for us. In the event of an unfavorable result under these circumstances, our business, operating results and financial position could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Stock Ownership\nOur stock price is/may be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to certain factors, including:\n\u00b7\nU.S. and global economic conditions leading to general declines in market capitalizations, with such declines not associated with operating performance.\n\u00b7\nQuarter-to-quarter variations in results of operations.\n\u00b7\nOur announcements of new products.\n\u00b7\nOur announcements of acquisitions.\n\u00b7\nOur announcements of significant new customers or contracts.\n\u00b7\nOur competitors\u2019 announcements of new products.\n\u00b7\nOur product development or release schedule.\n\u00b7\nChanges in our management team.\n\u00b7\nGeneral conditions in the software industry.\n\u00b7\nInvestor perceptions and expectations regarding our products, plans and strategic position and those of our competitors and customers.\nIn addition, the public stock markets experience extreme price and trading volume volatility, particularly in high-technology sectors of the market. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons often unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. The broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAccounting charges may cause fluctuations in our annual or quarterly financial results.\nOur financial results may be affected by non-cash and other accounting charges, including:\n\u00b7\nAmortization of intangible assets, including acquired technology and product rights.\n\u00b7\nAcquisition expenses.\n\u00b7\nImpairment of goodwill and intangibles.\n\u00b7\nShare-based compensation expense.\n\u00b7\nRestructuring charges.\n\u00b7\nImpairment of long-lived assets.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter and Delaware law could inhibit others from acquiring us.\nSome of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in Delaware law could, together or separately:\n\u00b7\nDiscourage potential acquisition proposals.\n\u00b7\nDelay or prevent a change in control.\n\u00b7\nLimit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nIn particular, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws prohibit stockholders from voting by written consent or calling meetings of the stockholders. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any interested stockholder, as defined in the statute, for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder.\nOur directors and executive officers continue to have substantial control over us.\nOur directors and executive officers, together with their affiliates and related persons, beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 29% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2014. These stockholders would have the ability to substantially control GlobalSCAPE and direct its policies including the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, such as the election of directors and any acquisition or merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for our Board of Directors to be divided into three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms. As a result, approximately one-third of our Board of Directors will be elected each year.\nStockholders\u2019 ownership of our stock may be significantly diluted, affecting the value of the stock.\nThere were options for 2,157,025 shares outstanding under our employee and director stock option plans as of March 13, 2015, of which 1,306,869 were vested. We have filed a registration statement under the Securities Act, covering stock issued upon the exercise of options by non-affiliates, and we may file a registration statement covering options held by affiliates as well. If we do not file a registration statement covering affiliates, affiliates who exercise their options may choose to sell the stock under an exemption from registration, such as Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The exercise of these options and sale of the resulting stock could depress the value of our stock.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe are vulnerable to claims that our products infringe third-party intellectual property rights particularly because our products are partially developed by independent parties.\nFrom time to time, we experience claims that our products infringe third-party intellectual property rights. We may be exposed to future litigation based on claims that our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that some of the code in our products is developed by independent parties or licensed from third parties over whom we have less control than we exercise over internal developers. In addition, we expect that infringement claims against software developers will become more prevalent as the number of products and developers grows and the functionality of software programs in the market increasingly overlaps. Companies in the technology industry, and other patent and trademark holders seeking to profit from royalties in connection with grants of licenses, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, we may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities.\nResponding to and defending against such claims may cause us to incur significant expense and divert the time and efforts of our management and employees. Successful assertion of such claims could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from selling our products and services, damage our reputation, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms, any of which could materially harm our business. In addition, we may decide to pay substantial settlement costs in connection with any claim or litigation, whether or not successfully asserted.\nWhile it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation incidents to our business, defense costs may be significant, and we believe the costs associated with this litigation or other claims of infringement could generally have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming.\nFor any intellectual property rights claim against us or our customers, we may have to pay damages and indemnify our customers against damages.\nClaims of infringement could require us to re-engineer our products or seek to obtain licenses from third parties in order to continue offering its products. In addition, an adverse legal decision affecting our intellectual property, or the use of significant resources to defend against this type of claim could place a significant strain on our financial resources and harm our reputation.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights.\nOur software code, and trade and service marks are some of our most valuable assets. Given the global nature of the Internet and our business, we are vulnerable to the misappropriation of this intellectual property, particularly in foreign markets, such as China and Eastern Europe, where laws or law enforcement practices are less developed. The global nature of the Internet makes it difficult to control the ultimate destination or security of our software making it more likely that unauthorized third parties will copy certain portions of our proprietary information or reverse engineer the proprietary information used in its programs. If our proprietary rights were infringed by a third-party and we did not have adequate legal recourse, our ability to earn profits, which are highly dependent on those rights, would be severely diminished.\nOther companies may own, obtain or claim trademarks that could prevent, limit or interfere with our use of our trademarks.\nOur various trademarks are important to our business. If we were to lose the use of any of our trademarks, our business would be harmed and we would have to devote substantial resources towards developing an independent brand identity. Defending or enforcing our trademark rights at a local and international level could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.", "PERMNO": 92174, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "GSB"}
