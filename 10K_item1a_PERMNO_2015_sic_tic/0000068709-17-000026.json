{"cik": "68709", "company": "MTS SYSTEMS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves risks. The following summarizes what we believe to be the most important risks facing us that could adversely impact our business, financial condition or operating results. The information about these risks should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nMarket Risks\nOur business is significantly international in scope.\nWe have manufacturing facilities in North America, Europe and Asia. Sales outside of the United States (U.S.), including export sales from U.S. business locations, accounted for approximately 75% of our revenue in fiscal year 2016. Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in foreign countries. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nexposure to the risk of currency value fluctuations, where payment for products is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars;\n\u2022\nvariability in the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated assets, earnings and cash flows;\n\u2022\ndifficulty enforcing agreements, including patent and trademarks, and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\ntax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S. and the imposition of withholding requirements on foreign earnings;\n\u2022\nhigher danger of terrorist activity, war or civil unrest, compared to domestic operations;\n\u2022\nimposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing global operations;\n\u2022\nrequired compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applicable to our international operations and significant compliance costs and penalties for failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets.\nVolatility in the global economy could adversely affect results.\nLong-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets would likely adversely affect our customers\u2019 operations and financing of both our international and U.S. customers and could therefore result in a decrease in orders and revenue. In addition, during periods of economic uncertainty, our customers\u2019 spending patterns and financing availability could be negatively impacted, reducing demand for our products and services.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our financial results.\nAlthough our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a large portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in Euros, the Japanese yen, the Chinese yuan and other foreign currencies. Our profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against these currencies in which we generate revenues and incur expenses. To the extent that we are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have an adverse effect on financial results. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported sales and earnings from our international operations will be lower because the applicable local currency will translate into fewer U.S. dollars. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular, a significant change in the relative values of the U.S. dollar, Euro, Japanese yen or Chinese yuan could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition given that approximately 75% of our revenue has historically been derived from customers outside of the U.S. Additionally, there has been and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the United Kingdom's referendum held on June 23, 2016, in which British voters approved the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as \"Brexit.\" As further described in Item 7 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, revenue for fiscal year 2016 was negatively impacted by currency translation.\nOur business is subject to strong competition.\nOur products are sold in competitive markets throughout the world. Competition is based on application knowledge, product features and design, brand recognition, reliability, technology, breadth of product offerings, price, delivery, customer relationships and after-market support. If we are not perceived as competitive in overall value as measured by these criteria, our customers would likely choose solutions offered by our competitors or developed internally.\nOur business is subject to customer demand cycles.\nFor many of our products, orders are subject to customers\u2019 procurement cycles and their willingness and ability to invest in capital, especially in the cyclical automotive, aircraft and machine tool industries. Any event that adversely impacts those customers\u2019 new product development activities may reduce their demand for our products.\nWe may experience difficulty obtaining materials or components for our products, or the cost of materials or components may increase.\nWe purchase materials and components from third-party suppliers, some of whom may be competitors. Other materials and components may be provided by a limited number of suppliers or by sole sources and could only be replaced with difficulty or at significant added cost. Additionally, some materials or components may become scarce or difficult to obtain in the market or they may increase in price. This could adversely affect the lead-time within which we receive the materials or components, and in turn affect our commitments to our customers, or could adversely affect the material cost or quality.\nInterest rate fluctuations could adversely affect results.\nSignificant changes in interest rates may affect our business in several ways, depending on our financial position and financing needs. On July 5, 2016, we entered into a new senior secured credit facility that provides for a $100,000 revolving credit facility and a $460,000 term loan B facility, both of which require that we pay a variable interest rate on outstanding borrowings. The size of the revolving credit facility was increased from $100,000 to $120,000 on July 29, 2016 through an amendment to the Credit Agreement. The debt under the term loan facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1.00% of the original principal amount and matures on July 5, 2023. As of October 1, 2016, we did not have any borrowings under the revolving credit facility; however, we may, at times, use debt under the revolving credit facility to purchase shares of our common stock, finance working capital needs or continue to finance the growth of the business through acquisitions. Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs. Subsequent to our fiscal year end, we hedged against a portion of the risk on the term facility by swapping the variable rate for a fixed rate. Increases in interest rates may directly impact the amount of interest we are required to pay and reduce earnings accordingly. Conversely, lower interest rates will adversely impact the interest we earn on cash and short-term investments.\nOur outstanding 8.75% tangible equity units may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by the outstanding 8.75% tangible equity units sold in our June 2016 public offering. For example, additional shares of our common stock will be issuable upon settlement of the purchase contract component of the tangible equity units. The settlement rates for such purchase contracts are subject to certain anti-dilution and make-whole adjustments that could increase, potentially significantly, the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon such settlement. As a result, the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by the following factors:\n\u2022\ninvestors\u2019 anticipation of the sale into the market of a substantial number of additional shares of common stock received upon settlement of the purchase contract component of the tangible equity units;\n\u2022\npossible sales of our common stock by investors who view the tangible equity units as a more attractive means of equity participation in us than owning shares of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nhedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving the tangible equity units, the purchase contracts and our common stock.\nIn addition, our debt obligations under the senior amortizing note component of the tangible equity units may further influence the market price of our common stock, including but not limited to our ability to make timely payments to holders of the notes.\nWe are not in compliance with the requirements of Nasdaq for continued listing, and if Nasdaq does not concur that we have adequately remedied our non-compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), our common stock may be delisted from trading on Nasdaq, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our shareholders.\nOn December 6, 2016, we received a deficiency letter from Nasdaq indicating that we, as a result of not filing our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2016 (the \u201cLate Annual Report\u201d) in a timely manner and disclosing that we would not be able to file the Late Annual Report within the 15-day extension period provided in Rule 12b-25(b) under the Exchange Act, were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing. In addition, on February 15, 2017, we received a second deficiency letter from Nasdaq indicating that we, as a result of not filing our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended December 31, 2016 (the \u201cLate Quarterly Report\u201d and together with the Late Annual Report, the \u201cLate Reports\u201d) in a timely manner and disclosing that we would not be able to file the Late Quarterly Report within the five-day extension period provided in Rule 12b-25(b) under the Exchange Act, together with our prior and ongoing failure to timely file the Late Annual Report, were not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing. As requested by Nasdaq, we were required to submit a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s filing requirements for continued listing within 60 calendar days of the date of the initial letter.\nOn January 27, 2017, we submitted our plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s filing requirements for continued listing and subsequently provided Nasdaq with updates and additional information on February 23, 2017 and March 23, 2017. On April 7, 2017, Nasdaq granted us an extension to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s filing requirements for continued listing so long as the Late Reports are filed by May 30, 2017. While we believe that by filing the Late Reports we meet the condition for the extension and will regain compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), any failure to comply with Nasdaq\u2019s filing requirements in the future could result in our common stock being delisted and there can be no assurance whether or when it would again be listed for trading on Nasdaq or any other securities exchange. In addition, the market price of our shares might decline and become more volatile, and our shareholders might find that their investment in our shares has limited liquidity, which could have a further adverse effect on the price of our stock.\nAs a result of the delayed filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended December 31, 2016 and this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC, we are not currently eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of securities, which may adversely affect our ability to raise future capital or complete acquisitions.\nWe are not currently eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3 and we will not become eligible until we have timely filed certain periodic reports required under the Exchange Act for twelve consecutive calendar months. There can be no assurance when we will meet this requirement, which depends in part upon our ability to file our periodic reports on a timely basis in the future. Should we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public before we are eligible to do so using Form S-3, our transaction costs and the amount of time required to complete the transaction could increase, making it more difficult to execute any such transaction successfully and potentially having an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOperational Risks\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in both fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2016. If our remedial measures do not continue to be sufficient to address the material weaknesses we identified in fiscal year 2015 and subsequently remediated in fiscal year 2016, if our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness we identified in fiscal year 2016, or if significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements, which could adversely affect our stock price and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nFor the last two fiscal years, we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Most recently, as described in Item 9A in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of October 1, 2016, we disclosed a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting due to our failure to have effective processes and controls relative to adherence to our Code of Conduct by employees involved with our business in China. These deficiencies were uncovered through the investigation into violation of our Code of Conduct by our former China Test leader and several other former senior managers associated with our China Test operations. While we are committed to remediating the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material weakness identified in fiscal year 2016, there can be no assurances that our remediation efforts, which are further described in detail later in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, will be successful. In addition, as reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2015, as of October 3, 2015, we concluded that there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses related to our risk assessment, information and communications and monitoring processes with respect to revenue, identification of deliverables contained in multiple element revenue arrangements and timely closure of revenue projects and release of residual accrued costs. In fiscal year 2016, we have remediated the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material weaknesses in fiscal year 2015 by takings steps that included (i) performing a complete review of our revenue recognition controls and procedures by members of our management team with the requisite level of accounting knowledge, experience and training, and with independent outside resources, (ii) developing an internal communications protocol among all individuals in the organization responsible for performing control activities with respect to revenue recognition and (iii) implementing new procedures in our sales and contracting processes to include identification of specific deliverables contained within multiple element revenue arrangements. There can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent future control deficiencies (including material weaknesses) from happening that could cause us to incur unforeseen costs, negatively impact our results of operations, cause our consolidated financial results to contain material misstatements, cause the market price of our common stock to decline, damage our reputation or have other potential material adverse consequences.\nThe reorganized Test business structure, processes and operating systems may not deliver the results we require for growth of the business.\nWe continue to invest in our Test operating model and modify our business processes and systems. Given the growth in demand and sophistication of testing needs across the primary markets served, on January 5, 2017, we announced that Test would be divided into two separate business units, \u201cMaterials Test Systems\u201d and \u201cVehicles and Structure Test Systems.\u201d The focus of the \u201cMaterials Test Systems\u201d business unit will be on providing solutions to global customers involved in developing and manufacturing advanced materials that are essential to new aircraft and propulsion systems, and are increasingly critical to advance automobiles, such as those with electric or hybrid-electric powertrains, and trucks. The \u201cVehicles and Structures Test Systems\u201d business unit will focus on providing test solutions to automotive, aerospace, infrastructure and energy markets worldwide. We are restructuring the Test business to make it a more scalable business model in the markets that we currently serve. Successful implementation of these initiatives is critical to the growth of our business. As a result of the reorganization, successful execution as well as the hiring of personnel to lead the each of the separate business units may have limited success or not be successful at all.\nWe may not realize the growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from our recent acquisition of PCB.\nThe benefits that are expected to result from our July 5, 2016 acquisition of PCB, the largest acquisition in our history, will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies as a result of the acquisition. Our success in realizing these growth opportunities and cost synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of PCB. There is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition as sizable as PCB. The process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, our and PCB\u2019s activities. Members of our senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage other aspects of our company, service existing customers, attract new customers and develop new products or strategies. If senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration\nprocess, our business could suffer. There can be no assurance that we will successfully or cost-effectively integrate PCB. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEven if we are able to integrate PCB successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and cost synergies that we currently expect from this integration, and we cannot guarantee that these benefits will be achieved within anticipated timeframes or at all. For example, we may not be able to eliminate duplicative costs. Moreover, we may incur substantial expenses in connection with the integration of PCB, and such expenses may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. While it is anticipated that certain expenses will be incurred to achieve cost synergies, such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately, and may exceed current estimates. Accordingly, the benefits from the acquisition may be offset by costs incurred related to, or delays in, integrating the businesses.\nPCB may have liabilities that are not known, probable or estimable at this time and we may become subject to additional risks and uncertainties relating to PCB and its business.\nUpon completion of the acquisition of PCB, PCB became our wholly owned subsidiary and, as a result, we became subject to all of its liabilities. There could be unasserted claims or assessments that we failed or were unable to discover or identify in the course of performing our due diligence investigation of PCB. In addition, there may be liabilities that are neither probable nor estimable at this time that may become probable or estimable in the future. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We may learn additional information about PCB that adversely affects us, such as unknown, unasserted or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws.\nIn addition, we may become subject to additional risks associated with PCB and its business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming, as PCB was not previously operating as a public company. The difficulties of integrating the businesses include, among others:\n\u2022\nfailure to implement our business plan for the combined business;\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in integrating equipment, logistics, information, communications and other systems;\n\u2022\npossible inconsistencies in standards, controls, contracts, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nimpacts of change in control provisions in contracts and agreements;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain key customers and suppliers;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nfailure to recruit and retain key employees to operate the combined business;\n\u2022\nincreased competition within the industries in which PCB operates;\n\u2022\ninherent operating risks in the business;\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities;\n\u2022\nadditional reporting requirements pursuant to applicable rules and regulations; and\n\u2022\nadditional requirements relating to internal control over financial reporting.\nThe integration of PCB\u2019s operations into ours following its acquisition could create additional risks for our internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe intend to integrate PCB into our control environment and subject it to internal control testing during fiscal year 2017, which means that deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting as a combined company may not be identified until then. Any such undiscovered deficiencies, if material, could result in misstatements of our results of operations, restatements of our financial statements, declines in the trading price of our common stock or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur business operations may be affected by government contracting risks.\nGovernment business is important to us and is expected to increase in the future. Revenue from U.S. Government contracts varies by year. Such revenue as a percent of our total revenue was approximately 3%, 3% and 5% for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe must comply with procurement laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting and result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. Failure to comply could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to secure future U.S. Government contracts and export control licenses and our results of operations or financial condition. These laws and regulations also create compliance risks and affect how we do business with federal agency clients. U.S. Government contracts, as well as contracts with certain foreign governments with which we do business, are also subject to modification or termination by the government, either for the\nconvenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. Further, any investigation relating to, or suspension or debarment from, U.S. Government contracting could have a material impact on our results of operations as, during the duration of any suspension or debarment, we would be prohibited or otherwise limited in our ability to enter into prime contracts or subcontracts with U.S. Government agencies, certain entities that receive U.S. Government funds or that are otherwise subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), and certain state government or commercial customers who decline to contract with suspended or debarred entities. A federal suspension could also impact our ability to obtain export control licenses, which are materially important to our business.\nWe are subject to risks because we design and manufacture first-of-a-kind products.\nWe design and build systems that are unique and innovative and, in some cases, the first created to address complex and unresolved issues. The design, manufacture and support of these systems may involve higher than planned costs. If we are unable to meet our customers\u2019 expectations, our reputation and ability to further utilize our expertise will likely be damaged.\nThe backlog, sales, delivery and acceptance cycle for many of our products is irregular and may not develop as anticipated.\nMany of our products have long sales, delivery and acceptance cycles. In addition, our backlog is subject to order cancellations and our sales arrangements typically do not include specific cancellation provisions. If an order is canceled, we typically would only be entitled to receive reimbursement from the customer for actual costs incurred under the arrangement plus a reasonable margin. Events may cause recognition of orders, backlog and results of operations to be aberrant over shorter periods of time. These factors include the timing of individual large orders which may be impacted by interest rates, customer capital spending and product development cycles, design and manufacturing problems, capacity constraints, delays in product readiness, damage or delays in transit, problems in achieving technical performance requirements and various customer-initiated delays. Any such delay may cause fluctuations in our reported periodic financial results.\nThe business could be adversely affected by product liability and commercial litigation.\nOur products or services may be claimed to cause or contribute to personal injury or property damage to our customers\u2019 facilities. Additionally, we are, at times, involved in commercial disputes with third parties, such as customers, vendors and others. The ensuing claims may arise singularly, in groups of related claims or in class actions involving multiple claimants. Such claims and litigation are frequently expensive and time-consuming to resolve, may result in substantial liability to us, which liability and related costs and expenses may not be recoverable through insurance or other forms of reimbursement.\nWe may experience difficulties obtaining and retaining the services of skilled employees.\nWe rely on knowledgeable, experienced and skilled technical personnel, particularly engineers, sales management and service personnel, to design, assemble, sell and service our products. We may be unable to attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of such people, which could adversely affect our business. The inability to transfer knowledge and transition between roles within these teams could also adversely affect our business.\nWe may fail to protect our intellectual property effectively or may infringe upon the intellectual property of others.\nWe have developed significant proprietary technology and other rights that are used in our businesses. We rely on trade secret, copyright, trademark and patent laws and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. While we take enforcement of these rights seriously, other companies such as competitors or others in markets in which we do not participate, may attempt to copy or use our intellectual property for their own benefit.\nIn addition, the intellectual property of others also has an impact on our ability to offer some of our products and services for specific uses or at competitive prices. Competitors\u2019 patents or other intellectual property may limit our ability to offer products and services to our customers. Any infringement on the intellectual property rights of others could result in litigation and adversely affect our ability to continue to provide, or could increase the cost of providing, products and services.\nIntellectual property litigation is very costly and could result in substantial expense and diversions of our resources, both of which could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and results. In addition, there may be no effective legal recourse against infringement of our intellectual property by third parties, whether due to limitations on enforcement of rights in foreign jurisdictions or as a result of other factors.\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against misappropriation of data or breaches of security, our business operations and financial results could be adversely impacted.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of cyber attacks. Although we strive to have appropriate security controls in place, prevention of security breaches cannot be assured, particularly as cyber threats continue to evolve. We may be required to\nexpend additional resources to continue to enhance our security measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. The consequences of these risks could adversely impact our business operations and financial results.\nGovernment regulation imposes costs and other constraints.\nOur manufacturing operations and past and present ownership and operations of real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations pertaining to health and safety matters, as well as the handling or discharge of hazardous materials into the environment. We expect to continue to incur costs to comply with these laws, and may incur penalties for any failure to do so. We may also be identified as a responsible party and be subject to liability relating to any investigation and clean-up of properties used for industrial purposes or the generation or disposal of hazardous substances. Some of our export sales require approval from the U.S. government. Changes in political relations between the U.S. and foreign countries and/or specific potential customers for which export licenses may be required, may cause a license application to be delayed or denied, or a previously issued license withdrawn, rendering us unable to complete a sale, or vulnerable to competitors who do not operate under such restrictions. Capital expenditures for environmental compliance were not material in fiscal year 2016, and we do not expect such expenditures will be material in fiscal year 2017 but the factors described above may cause our estimates to differ from our expectations.\nWe have been required to conduct a good faith reasonable country of origin analysis on our use of \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d which has imposed and may impose additional costs on us and could raise reputational and other risks.\nThe SEC has promulgated final rules in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. While there is pending litigation challenging these rules, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. We have adopted a policy relating to conflict minerals, incorporating the standards set forth in the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development Due Diligence Guidance, which affects the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. As we continue our due diligence, we may face reputational challenges if we are unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products through the procedures we have and may continue to implement. We may also encounter challenges in our efforts to satisfy customers that may require all of the components of products purchased to be certified as conflict free. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier.\nWe may not achieve our growth plans for the expansion of the business.\nIn addition to market penetration, our long-term success depends on our ability to expand our business through (a) new product development and service offerings; (b) mergers and acquisitions; and/or (c) geographic expansion.\nNew product development and service offerings require that we maintain our ability to improve existing products, continue to bring innovative products and services to market in a timely fashion and adapt products and services to the needs and standards of current and potential customers. Our products and services may become less competitive or eclipsed by technologies to which we do not have access or which render our solutions obsolete.\nMergers and acquisitions will be accompanied by risks that may include:\n\u2022\nsuitable candidates may not exist or may not be available at acceptable costs;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ndisruption of ongoing business and distraction of management from the ongoing business;\n\u2022\ndilution of existing shareholders and earnings per share;\n\u2022\nunanticipated, undisclosed or inaccurately assessed liabilities, legal risks and costs; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties retaining the key vendors, customers or employees of the acquired business.\nAcquisitions of businesses having a significant presence outside the U.S. will increase our exposure to the risks of international operations discussed in the operational risk factors.\nGeographic expansion may be outside of the U.S., and hence will be disproportionately subject to the risks of international operations discussed in the operational risk factors.\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges for long-lived assets.\nAs of October 1, 2016, the net carrying value of long-lived assets (property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) totaled approximately $737,278. We periodically assess the value of these assets for impairment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our businesses, significant unexpected or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in\nimpairments to goodwill and other long-lived assets. In fiscal year 2016, we accelerated $91 of property and equipment depreciation related to the closure of our Machida, Japan facility, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. Future impairment charges could significantly affect results of operations in the periods for which any such impairment charges are recognized.\nOur investigation relating to our China operations and our failure to maintain effective processes and controls relative to adherence to our Code of Conduct by employees involved with our business in China may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOn November 29, 2016, we announced the initiation of an internal investigation into apparent violations of our Code of Conduct involving certain employees involved with our business in China. This investigation was focused on possible violations of company policy, corresponding internal control issues, including our control environment and adherence with the Company's compliance and monitoring programs, and possible violations of applicable law. Our Code of Conduct and other internal policies prohibit us and our employees from engaging in unethical business practices. However, there can be no assurance that all of our employees or agents will refrain from acting in violation of such policies and procedures or that our processes and controls will be sufficient to detect any such violations. The investigation into potential violations of these policies, or even allegations of such violations, and evaluation of our internal controls, could disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction and lead to significant costs and expenses, including legal and accounting fees and such expenses may have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Further, if our employees or agents violate such policies and procedures, such actions could result in management override of internal controls over financial reporting. If we, or our employees or agents acting on our behalf, are found to have engaged in practices that violate these policies and/or the law, we could suffer severe fines and penalties, profit disgorgement, injunctions on future conduct, securities litigation, material weaknesses in our financial reporting and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, including but not limited to our operations in China. In addition, our reputation, sales activities or stock price could be adversely affected if we become the subject of any negative publicity related to actual or potential violations of applicable laws and regulations.", "PERMNO": 50623, "SIC": 3829, "TIC": "MTSC"}
