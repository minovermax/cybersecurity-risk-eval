{"cik": "1053650", "company": "OMEGA PROTEIN CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company cautions investors that the following risk factors, and those factors described elsewhere in this report, other filings made by the Company with the SEC from time to time and press releases issued by the Company, could affect the Company\u2019s actual results which could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.\nThe risks described below are not the only ones facing the Company. The Company\u2019s business is also subject to other risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as competition, technological obsolescence, labor relations (including risks of strikes), general economic conditions and geopolitical events. Other risks not currently known to the Company or risks that the Company currently believes are immaterial may also materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to the Company\u2019s Business and Industry:\nThe Company is exploring and evaluating strategic alternatives for the Company\u2019s human nutrition segment and there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in identifying, or completing any strategic alternative, that any such strategic alternative will yield additional value for shareholders or that the process will not have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors has commenced a review of strategic alternatives for the Company\u2019s human nutrition segment, which could result in, among other things, a sale, consolidation or business combination, asset divestiture, partnering or other collaboration agreements, in one or more transactions, in addition to continuing to operate the human nutrition segment in the ordinary course of business or an exit of portions of that business. However, there can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives for the human nutrition segment will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction. In addition, the Company may incur substantial expenses associated with identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives for the human nutrition segment. The process of exploring strategic alternatives may be time consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s business operations and if the Company is unable to effectively manage the process, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nNo decision has been made with respect to any transaction and the Company cannot assure investors that it will be able to identify and undertake any transaction that allows its shareholders to realize an increase in the value of their stock or provide any guidance on the timing of such action, if any. The Company also cannot assure investors that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to shareholders than that reflected in the current stock price. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond the Company\u2019s control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in the Company\u2019s human nutrition segment and the availability of financing to potential buyers on reasonable terms.\nThe Company has not set a timetable for completion of the strategic alternatives review process and does not intend to discuss or disclose developments with respect to the process unless and until such time as the Board of Directors has approved a definitive course of action or otherwise concludes its review of strategic alternatives. As a consequence, perceived uncertainties related to the future of the Company may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and volatility in its stock price, and may make it more difficult for the Company to attract and retain qualified personnel, customers and business partners.\nIf the strategic review process for the Company\u2019s human nutrition segment were to result in a sale of that segment, we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of such sale, and such sale may materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s remaining business, results of operation and financial condition. If the strategic review process for the Company\u2019s human nutrition segment were to result in a sale of that segment, we may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of such sale for a variety of reasons, including, among others: (i) a sale of the Company\u2019s human nutrition segment, which represented 33% and 32% of the Company\u2019s total revenues and assets in 2016, respectively, would result in the Company becoming a smaller and less diversified company than prior to the completion of such sale. In such event, the Company would be more susceptible to factors affecting its animal nutrition segment and other possible adverse events (including those described in this Report and specifically in this Risk Factors section that are primarily applicable to the Company\u2019s animal nutrition segment) because our remaining business will be dependent on the menhaden fishery as its sole source of supply and will be less diversified; and (ii) as a smaller company, we may be unable to obtain certain goods, services and technologies at prices or on terms as favorable as those we obtained prior to completion of such sale. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from such sale, such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOmega Protein, the Company\u2019s largest operating subsidiary, is dependent on a single natural resource and may not be able to catch the amount of menhaden that it requires to operate profitably. Omega Protein\u2019s primary raw material is menhaden. Omega Protein\u2019s business is materially dependent on its annual menhaden harvest in ocean waters along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Omega Protein\u2019s ability to meet its raw material requirements through its annual menhaden harvest fluctuates from year to year and month to month due to natural and other conditions over which Omega Protein has no control, including varying fish populations, adverse weather conditions, climate change, fish disease, water nutrient content and disruptions like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill incident in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. These conditions may prevent Omega Protein from operating profitably.\nOmega Protein\u2019s operations are geographically concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico where they are susceptible to regional adverse weather patterns such as hurricanes. Two of Omega Protein\u2019s three operating plants are located in the Gulf of Mexico (one in Louisiana and one in Mississippi), a region which has historically been subject to a late summer/early fall hurricane season. Omega Protein\u2019s Virginia facility has in the past also been adversely affected by hurricanes. For example, in September 2008, Omega Protein\u2019s Abbeville and former Cameron, Louisiana fish processing facilities were damaged by Hurricane Ike and were non-operational immediately after the hurricane. Operations at the Abbeville fish processing facility were restored to full capacity within two weeks, and the Cameron fish processing facility was fully functional prior to the beginning of the 2009 fishing season. As an additional example, all three of Omega Protein\u2019s Gulf of Mexico plants operated at the time were severely damaged within a one-month span by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in August and September 2005. Immediately after the second hurricane, approximately 70% of Omega Protein\u2019s 2004 production capacity was impaired and Omega Protein\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition were materially adversely affected. Additional future weather related disruptions could, if they occur, also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOmega Protein\u2019s operations are geographically concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico where they are susceptible to oil spills from offshore drilling, production and transportation activities. Two of Omega Protein\u2019s three operating plants are located in the Gulf of Mexico (one in Louisiana and one in Mississippi), a region which has historically had a high concentration of oil and gas infrastructure. If this infrastructure were to be become damaged due to natural or other disasters such as the oil spill that resulted from the Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010, then it is possible that environmental damages to the area and ecosystem could result. If these environmental damages occurred, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operation and financial condition.\nIf the Company\u2019s Omega Protein subsidiary fails to comply with the terms of its probation under plea agreements entered into in June 2013 and December 2016, it could be subject to criminal prosecution. In June 2013, Omega Protein, the Company\u2019s principal subsidiary, entered into a plea agreement with the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia to resolve a government investigation related to the fishing vessels and operations of its Reedville, Virginia facility. Consistent with the terms of the Virginia Plea Agreement, the subsidiary pled guilty in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to two felony counts under the Clean Water Act, paid a fine of $5.5 million, made a $2.0 million contribution to an environmental fund, and was sentenced to a three year probation term that was originally scheduled to end in June 2016, but which was extended by the Virginia Court in December 2016 for two years due to the issues associated with the second plea agreement described below. Accordingly, the probation term for the Virginia Plea Agreement will terminate in June 2018.\nIn December 2016, Omega Protein entered into a plea agreement with the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Louisiana to resolve a government investigation related to its Abbeville, Louisiana operations. Consistent with the terms of the Louisiana Plea Agreement, the subsidiary pled guilty in the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana to two felony counts under the Clean Water Act, paid a fine of $1.0 million and made a $0.2 million contribution to a local law enforcement fund. The Louisiana Plea Agreement was approved by the Louisiana Court on January 18, 2017.\nThe Virginia Plea Agreement and the terms of the Virginia Court\u2019s sentencing order required Omega Protein to develop and implement an environmental compliance program at all of its facilities, and also imposed a three year period of probation originally scheduled to end in June 2016, but has since been extended to end in June 2018 due to the issues resolved by the Louisiana Plea Agreement. The probation term for the Louisiana Plea Agreement will terminate in January 2020. The Company has implemented a comprehensive compliance program which covers the areas addressed by the Virginia Plea Agreement and Louisiana Plea Agreement. The U.S. Probation Office, in consultation with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices for the Eastern District of Virginia and the Western District of Louisiana, and the E.P.A., as necessary, has the right to monitor the Company\u2019s compliance with these requirements during the term of probation.\nIn the event that Omega Protein does not comply with the terms of the plea agreements and the courts\u2019 sentencing orders, including the terms of probation, it could be subject to additional criminal penalties or prosecution (including for the matters covered and resolved by the plea agreements). Particularly, if any additional acts of non-compliance were to occur in connection with the Virginia Plea Agreement, because these acts could be viewed by the Virginia Court as a second offense under the Virginia Plea Agreement (and a third offense overall), the Virginia Court could impose an enhanced sentence compared to a sentence for a first offense. In addition, if Omega Protein fails to maintain compliance with the Clean Water Act or other similar environmental regulatory requirements in the future, it could become subject to additional criminal or civil liability in connection with any such non-compliance. Omega Protein could also experience increased compliance costs, or alterations to the conduct of its normal course operations, in connection with these matters. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operation and financial condition.\nIn addition, the convictions under the Clean Water Act will adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to secure government contracts with the United States, and secure future loans under the NMFS Title XI loan program in connection with the affected facility. Omega Protein has received notice from the E.P.A. that it is ineligible, as a result of the convictions under the Clean Water Act, for receipt of government contracts, loans or benefits if any part of the work will be performed, or the loan collateral will be located, at the facility where an offense occurred.\nThe Company has received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Department of Justice requesting information in connection with a False Claims Act investigation. In October 2016, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Department of Justice requesting information in connection with a False Claims Act investigation. The government\u2019s investigation concerns whether there has been or is a violation of the False Claims Act in connection with Omega Protein\u2019s May 2010 certification to the U.S. Department of Commerce that Omega Protein\u2019s Reedville, Virginia facility was in compliance with federal environmental laws in order to obtain a loan guarantee under the Department of Commerce\u2019s Title XI loan program. That Title XI loan was repaid in full in November 2015 and the Company and its subsidiaries currently have no Title XI indebtedness outstanding. The Company has delivered responsive documents to the Department of Justice. The Company cannot predict the outcome of the investigation or the effect of the findings of the investigation on the Company, but it is possible that the foregoing matter could result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe Company has received a subpoena from the SEC requesting information relating to a Company subsidiary\u2019s compliance with probation terms and the Company\u2019s protection of whistleblower employees. In December 2016, the Company received a subpoena from the SEC requesting information in connection with an investigation relating to a Company subsidiary\u2019s compliance with its probation terms and the Company\u2019s protection of whistleblower employees. The Company is in the process of producing responsive documents to the SEC. The Company cannot predict the outcome of the investigation or the effect of the findings of the investigation on the Company, but it is possible that the foregoing matter could result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operation and financial condition.\nThe ASMFC has initiated regulatory action that may change the Atlantic menhaden quota among ASMFC member states or that may utilize new management reference points, either of which may lower future Atlantic menhaden harvests by the Company. In 2014, the ASMFC and the National Marine Fisheries Service jointly conducted a new benchmark stock assessment for Atlantic menhaden, which utilized new data sources and a new statistical model. Initial results of the 2014 assessment were peer reviewed in December 2014 and were accepted by the ASMFC at its February 2015 meeting. The 2014 stock assessment found that the Atlantic menhaden stock was not overfished and that overfishing for Atlantic menhaden was not occurring. The next assessment, which will be an update, will occur in 2017.\nBased on the 2014 assessment, the ASMFC Menhaden Board established a new coast-wide quota for Atlantic menhaden at its May 2015 meeting. The menhaden quota for the 2015 and 2016 fishing seasons was 187,880 metric tons, which represents a ten percent increase above the quota established in 2012. In February 2016, the ASMFC initiated the process to establish Atlantic menhaden harvest levels for the 2017 fishing year, and in October 2016, the ASMFC voted to increase the annual harvest quota by 6.45 percent, to 200,000 metric tons, for the Atlantic menhaden fish meal/oil fisheries and bait fisheries for the 2017 Atlantic menhaden fishing season. The updated Atlantic menhaden stock assessment results, expected in August 2017, will guide the ASMFC\u2019s quota-setting decisions for 2018 and afterwards.\nUnder the ASMFC\u2019s Interstate Fisheries Management Plan for Atlantic Menhaden, the total coast wide quota is allocated among states based on average landings for the years 2009 to 2011. Under that formula, Virginia is allocated approximately 85% of the total allowable catch. Of Virginia\u2019s 2017 allocation, the Company was entitled to land approximately 153,000 metric tons.\nAt its May 2015 meeting, the ASMFC Menhaden Board also initiated a management action to review and potentially change the allocation of quota among the ASMFC member states. Some ASMFC member states with relatively low allocations of menhaden have argued that Virginia\u2019s share of the Atlantic menhaden quota is too high. The current allocation is based on landings data for the years 2009, 2010, and 2011, which were the most recent years for which data were available when the ASMFC established the quota system that went into effect in 2013. This is a common method by which the ASMFC allocates fishing privileges among its member states.\nIn the fall of 2016, the ASMFC held public hearings on a series of issues to be considered in a new amendment to the Atlantic menhaden fishery management plan, including alternatives means of allocating quota among states. The ASMFC intends to finalize this amendment in the fall of 2017, to be effective for 2018 and afterward. The public was asked to comment on a number of different ways to allocate allowable harvest, including having a single, coast-wide quota, allocating menhaden by gear type, and other options. Depending on the method chosen by the ASMFC to determine allocations and the overall quota levels set for 2018 and afterward, the ASMFC amendment to the Atlantic menhaden fishery management plan could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThis amendment will also consider establishing new interim management reference points - benchmarks used to establish quotas and determine when the stock is considered overfished - that consider Atlantic menhaden\u2019s role as forage in the marine ecosystem. The Company expects that if ASMFC action is taken to establish these interim reference points it will be completed in 2017 and effective in 2018. Regardless of whether any ASMFC decision is made in 2017 regarding interim reference points, the ASMFC Menhaden Board has convened a team of scientific advisors to develop ecological reference points specific to the Atlantic menhaden stock and that work is expected to be completed and peer-reviewed by 2019 or 2020.\nIn 2017, the ASMFC Menhaden Board will be considering whether or not to continue that process, and whether to use the current reference points or generic ecological reference points on either an interim or permanent basis. It is not possible to accurately predict, however, what the results of the 2017 update assessment will be or what decisions the ASMFC will make regarding reference points in the current amendment process or how, if new permanent or interim reference points are adopted, they will be utilized but it is possible that these decisions may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn the amendment under consideration, the ASMFC Menhaden Board will also consider changes to the Chesapeake Bay reduction fishery cap. This cap limits the amount of menhaden the Company can take annually from the Chesapeake Bay and is currently set at 87,216 metric tons. The Company\u2019s Chesapeake catches have been below the limit for all years in which it has been in effect. The options under consideration are maintaining the cap at its current level, eliminating the cap, or lowering it by some amount. Should the ASMFC prohibit the Company\u2019s harvest fishing in the Chesapeake Bay or lower the cap below the Company\u2019s recent catch levels in this fishing area, these changes could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFluctuation in the \u201ctotal yield\u201d derived from Omega Protein\u2019s fish catch could impact the Company\u2019s ability to operate profitably. The \u201ctotal yield,\u201d or the percentage of fish meal, fish oil and fish solubles products derived from the menhaden has fluctuated over the years and from month to month due to natural conditions relating to fish biology over which Omega Protein has no control. For example, the Company\u2019s oil yields for the 2016 fishing season were higher by 46% compared to those in the 2015 fishing season and were higher by 29% compared to the Company\u2019s five year oil yield average. Total yields for the 2016 fishing season increased by 10% compared to those in the 2015 fishing season and were higher by 6% compared to the Company\u2019s five year total yield average, due primarily to the higher fish oil yields. The Company believes that fish oil yields are influenced by multiple factors, including but not limited to, fish diet, weather, water temperature and nutrient content, fish population and age of fish, but specific relationships and inter-relationships are not generally well understood. Decreased fish catch offset the impact of higher oil yields and resulted in higher per unit inventory cost for the 2016 fishing season as compared to the 2015 fishing season.\nLaws or regulations regarding fish oil or meal importation into foreign jurisdictions may increase Omega Protein\u2019s costs or cause it to lose market share or eliminate certain countries altogether. Laws and regulations regarding the importation of fish meal or fish oil into foreign countries, particularly in countries such as China whose regulatory regimes may still be evolving, or in supra-national jurisdictions such as the European Union, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. More stringent laws and regulations, or new interpretations of, or changes to, those laws and regulations, in foreign jurisdictions on contaminant levels, permitted additives, health and sanitation requirements, import documentation, license requirement restrictions imposed by port of entry protocols or other similar restrictions could result in: (i) Omega Protein\u2019s incurrence of additional capital expenditures and operating costs in order to comply with these requirements, (ii) Omega Protein\u2019s withdrawal from marketing its products in those jurisdictions which could lead to material loss of revenues, earnings and market share, or (iii) costs of demurrage, cure or product recall incurred by Omega Protein as it complies with, or attempts to comply with, these restrictions. For example, exports of fish meal to China and the European Union are subject to certain health and sanitation requirements that are administered by the SIP, a U.S. federal agency selected by these jurisdictions as the competent authority to oversee compliance with export requirements by U.S. based manufacturers. Pursuant to SIP\u2019s interpretation and application of China\u2019s and the European Union\u2019s health and sanitation requirements, several domestic and foreign facilities, including Omega Protein\u2019s processing facilities and its fish meal warehouses, may from time to time be limited or restricted in their ability to obtain export certificates in support of shipments of fish meal to China or the European Union or certain shipments by the Company may need to be reprocessed in order to meet these requirements. In addition, certain foreign countries impose health and sanitation testing requirements for fish meal and fish oil exports that require pre-shipment testing of lots. These testing requirements may hinder particular lots from being approved for export to those countries. These limitations and restrictions may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation. If a greater portion of the Company\u2019s sales are derived internationally, or become more concentrated in certain countries or jurisdictions such as China or the European Union, the potential impact of this risk is likely to become larger.\nPresident Trump has made comments suggesting that he was not supportive of certain existing international trade agreements. At this time, it remains unclear what the new Presidential administration or Congress may do with respect to these international trade agreements. If the administration or Congress take action to withdraw from or materially modify international trade agreements, it is possible that the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nLaws or regulations regarding fishing vessels, safety or environmental protection may result in additional costs, requirements and procedures. Omega Protein, through its operation of fishing vessels, is subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Coast Guard, the National Transportation Safety Board and the U.S. Customs Service. The Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board set safety standards and are authorized to investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards. The U.S. Customs Service is authorized to inspect vessels at will. Omega Protein\u2019s operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including the federal Clean Water Act, which imposes strict controls against discharge of pollutants in reportable quantities, and along with the Oil Pollution Act, imposes substantial liability for the costs of oil removal, remediation and damages. Omega Protein\u2019s operations also are subject to the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, which imposes liability, without regard to fault, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of any \u201chazardous substances\u201d into the environment and the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act. The implementation of continuing vessel, safety and environmental regulations from these authorities could result in additional requirements and procedures for the Company, and it is possible that the costs of these requirements and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operation.\nLaws or regulations that restrict or prohibit menhaden or purse seine fishing operations, or the manufacture, sale or distribution of menhaden products, could adversely affect Omega Protein\u2019s ability to operate. The adoption of new laws or regulations at federal, regional, state or local levels that restrict or prohibit menhaden or purse seine fishing operations, or the manufacture, sale or distribution of menhaden products, or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations, could materially adversely affect Omega Protein\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the impact of a violation by Omega Protein of federal, regional, state or local law or regulation relating to its fishing operations, the protection of the environment or the health and safety of its employees could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operation.\nThe Company is also subject to the introduction of legislation from time to time that seeks to ban its operations in their entirety or restrict the sale of its products. For example, in 2007, two bills in the U.S. House of Representatives were introduced and in 2009, a bill in the U.S. Senate was introduced, each of which would have banned menhaden fishing on the Atlantic coast. In the Virginia legislature, bills have been introduced in recent years that would have provided for a restriction on menhaden fishing in Virginia waters. As an additional example, a 2011 Maryland House bill would have prohibited the manufacture, sale or distribution in Maryland of products obtained from reduction of Atlantic menhaden. While none of these bills ever made any substantial headway in their respective legislative bodies, they are indicative of the challenging legislative and regulatory environment in which the Company operates and to which the Company must devote substantial resources. The enactment of any restrictions similar to those described in the above bills could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWorldwide supply and demand relationships, which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, influence the prices that the Company receives for many of its products and may from time to time result in low prices for many of the Company\u2019s products. Prices for many of the Company\u2019s products are subject to, or influenced by, worldwide and local supply and demand relationships over which the Company has no control and which tend to fluctuate to a significant extent over the course of a year and from year to year. The factors that influence these supply and demand relationships on the Company\u2019s marine based products include world supplies of fish meal and oil made from other fish species, animal proteins and fats, palm oil, rapeseed oil, soy meal and oil, and other edible oils. The factors that influence the supply and demand relationship for the Company\u2019s human nutrition products include the supply of coconut and other plant ingredients, the supply of various marine oils, the availability of competing products and evolving consumer preferences.\nNew laws or regulations regarding contaminants in fish oil or fish meal may increase Omega Protein\u2019s cost of production or cause Omega Protein to lose business. It is possible that future enactment of increasingly stringent regulations regarding contaminants in fish meal or fish oil by foreign countries or the United States may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. More stringent regulations could result in: (i) Omega Protein\u2019s incurrence of additional capital expenditures on contaminant reduction technology in order to meet the requirements of those jurisdictions, and possibly higher production costs for Omega Protein\u2019s products, or (ii) Omega Protein\u2019s withdrawal from marketing its products in those jurisdictions.\nOmega Protein\u2019s fish catch may be impacted by restrictions on its spotter aircraft. If Omega Protein\u2019s spotter aircraft are prohibited or restricted from operating in their normal manner during Omega Protein\u2019s fishing season, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. For example, as a direct result of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the Secretary of Transportation issued a federal ground stop order that grounded certain aircraft (including Omega Protein\u2019s fish-spotting aircraft) for approximately nine days. This loss of spotter aircraft coverage severely hampered Omega Protein\u2019s ability to locate menhaden fish during this nine-day period and thereby reduced its amount of saleable product.\nThe Company\u2019s insurance coverage may not be sufficient, and insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. The Company maintains insurance against physical loss and damage to its assets and coverage against third party liability it may incur in the course of its operations, as well as workers\u2019 compensation, United States Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and Jones Act coverage. The Company\u2019s liability coverage program is generally comprised of several excess liability policies, which are subject to deductibles, underlying limits, annual aggregates and exclusions. The Company believes its insurance coverage to be in such form, against such risks, for such amounts and subject to such deductibles and self-retentions as are generally prudent for its operations, but the securing of such coverage by necessity requires judgment in the balancing of retained risk and the cost effectiveness of such insurance programs. As a general matter, the Company has chosen to increase its deductibles and self-retentions in order to manage rising insurance premium costs. These higher deductibles and self-retentions have resulted at times in the past in greater uninsured losses to the Company and will expose the Company to greater risk of loss if additional future claims occur.\nInsurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on what the Company considers to be commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, any insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or damage to, any of the Company\u2019s facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without a negative impact on the results of its business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, property insurance coverage for flood damages caused by named storm hurricanes has in the past been limited in its availability, and it is possible that such limited coverage might not be adequate to reimburse the Company for its losses if these types of flood losses occur. In addition, should a Company insurer become insolvent, the Company would be responsible for payment of all outstanding claims associated with that insurer\u2019s policies.\nIn addition, insurance coverage is not generally available for punitive damages, and some courts have been increasingly permissive regarding the imposition of punitive damages for Jones Act cases in recent years. For example, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that punitive damages are permissible in Jones Act \u201cmaintenance and cure\u201d claims. If material uninsured punitive damages were to be assessed against the Company pursuant to a Jones Act claim or otherwise, this assessment could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation.\nThe Company\u2019s estimated reserves for claims may not be sufficient. Omega Protein carries insurance for certain losses relating to its vessels and Jones Act liabilities for employees aboard its vessels. Omega Protein records gross insurance reserves by using an estimation process that considers Company-specific and industry information as well as management\u2019s experience, assumptions and consultation with counsel. These reserves include estimated settlement costs. In addition, insurance receivables are recorded for those portions of the claims in excess of Company insurance policy annual aggregate deductibles and stop losses. Management\u2019s current estimated range of liabilities related to such cases is based on claims for which management can estimate the amount and range of loss. For those claims where there may be a range of loss, Omega Protein has recorded an estimated liability inside that range, based on management\u2019s experience, assumptions and consultation with counsel. The process of estimating and establishing reserves for these claims is inherently uncertain and the actual ultimate net cost of a claim may vary materially from the estimated amount reserved. There is some degree of inherent variability in assessing the ultimate amount of losses associated with these claims due to the extended period of time that transpires between when a claim occurs and the full settlement of the claim. This variability is generally greater for Jones Act claims by vessel employees.\nOmega Protein evaluates loss estimates associated with claims and losses as additional information becomes available and revises its estimates. Although management believes estimated reserves related to these claims are adequately recorded, it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from the recorded reserves, which could materially impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOther sources of Long Chain Omega-3 fatty acids may be discovered or created and might compete with the Company\u2019s menhaden-based products. It is possible that other sources of omega-3 fatty acids derived from other sources such as animals, plants, algae, yeast, bacteria, genetically modified organisms or synthetic sources might be discovered or created and these sources might compete with menhaden-based products. Some of the research projects attempting to discover or develop these new sources of omega-3 products may be funded by companies with greater resources than the Company. If such products are developed and became commercially available to the point where the Company\u2019s menhaden product sales are adversely impacted, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation.\nContinued implementation and development of the National Ocean Policy Plan could result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation. In June 2009, President Obama issued a Presidential Memorandum creating an Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force charged with, among other things, creating a unitary National Ocean Policy for the United States. In July 2010, the Interagency Ocean Policy Task Force issued its Final Recommendations for a new policy and administrative structure to comprehensively assess, evaluate, and manage activities and uses impacting the nation\u2019s oceans, coasts and Great Lakes. That same day, President Obama issued Executive Order 13547, creating the National Ocean Council (\u201cNOC\u201d), a body comprised of cabinet secretaries, agency heads and other senior members of the federal government. As an entity created solely through executive action, the NOC and/or its purpose and mission are subject to elimination or change by the new Presidential administration.\nIn January 2012, the NOC issued a Draft National Ocean Policy Plan (\u201cNOPP\u201d) for public comment. In general, the NOPP outlines a detailed system of federal-state cooperation in managing all aspects of ocean policy, including, most relevantly, marine transportation and fisheries. If implemented, the NOPP would create eight regional councils with federal, state and tribal representatives that will draft comprehensive regional management plans that will be implemented by federal and state agencies pursuant to their governing legal authorities. Such \u201ccoastal and marine spatial plans\u201d are to be guided by, among other things, the concept of \u201cecosystem-based management,\u201d which the NOPP defines as \u201can integrated approach to resource management that considers the entire ecosystem, including humans.\u201d\nIn October 2014, pursuant to the NOPP and Executive Order 13547, the Regional Planning Body (\u201cRPB\u201d) released a Draft Ocean Action Plan (\u201cDraft Action Plan\u201d) and initial outline of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Ocean Assessment (\u201cROA\u201d) for public comment. The ROA is intended to serve as an overarching environmental assessment document intended to support the Draft Action Plan. Since its release, the ROA has undergone further development, including more detailed information on Atlantic Ocean resources, ecosystems, and uses. Currently, it only mentions Atlantic menhaden as a \u201cforage fish\u201d in its discussion of \u201cImportant or Sensitive Species, Guilds, and Habitat.\u201d Further development of the ROA is expected to occur over a period of several years and will not, in and of itself, result in any actions being taken or prohibited. However, depending on the quality and level of analysis regarding Atlantic menhaden, such analysis could be used to support future actions taken under the Draft Action Plan that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation.\nAfter two years of further refinement and public meetings, a final Draft Action Plan was submitted to the NOC in October 2016 and was certified by the NOC in December 2016. The Action Plan does not mention Atlantic menhaden or prescribe any measures for management of this species or forage species more generally. Under the overarching goal of providing for a \u201cHealthy Ocean Ecosystem,\u201d the Action Plan calls for identifying \u201cecologically rich areas of the ocean,\u201d a process which may result in identification of areas currently utilized for fishing activities conducted by the Company\u2019s vessels. It is possible that such identification could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation.\nThe Gulf of Mexico Alliance (\u201cGMA\u201d), formed in 2004, serves as the regional planning body under the NOPP for the Gulf of Mexico. The GMA adopted its first action plan in 2006, which contained broad objectives, such as identifying Gulf habitats, environmental education, wetland restoration, and water quality. GMA\u2019s second action plan, covering 2009-2014, continued this focus and added a collection of ecosystem data to support fisheries management and to support ecosystem-based management initiatives as an action item. The GMA\u2019s third action plan was released in 2016. The third GMA action plan calls for no new initiatives or actions that appear to impact the Gulf of Mexico menhaden fishery. To date, the GMA has generally focused on data collection and high level objectives implemented over a period of years. Therefore, the Company believes that the GMA\u2019s third action plan is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation, although it is possible that it could do so if the plan were to substantially regulate the menhaden fishery in a materially adverse manner.\nThe Company\u2019s acquisition of Bioriginal Food & Science, which closed in September 2014, was a sizeable acquisition that could pose continuing integration challenges as it is integrated with the Company\u2019s human nutrition division. One component of the Company\u2019s growth strategy in the human nutrition segment has been to acquire complementary businesses that expand its customer base and provide access to new markets and increased benefits of scale. For example, the Company acquired the businesses of Cyvex Nutrition in 2010, InCon Processing in 2012, Wisconsin Specialty Protein in 2013 and most recently, Bioriginal Food & Science, in September 2014. In 2015, the Company began further integration of these businesses under the name Bioriginal. In 2016, InCon suspended its operations and the Company sold its assets to a third party. Acquisitions and integration plans involve certain known and unknown risks that could cause the Company\u2019s actual growth or operating results to differ from its expectations. The Bioriginal Food & Science acquisition involved the acquisition of a company headquartered in Canada which also had European operations, and which may have posed more risks than a domestic acquisition. It is possible that the continuing integration of Bioriginal Food & Science and the Company\u2019s other human nutrition businesses may divert management\u2019s attention away from its existing animal nutrition business, resulting in the loss of key customers or employees, or expose the Company to unanticipated problems.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to successfully integrate Bioriginal Food & Science and the Company\u2019s other human nutrition businesses could adversely affect the Company\u2019s other business operations and financial results. The integration process may disrupt the Company\u2019s business and may preclude the realization of the full benefits expected by the Company from these acquisitions.\nSome of the difficulties in integrating Bioriginal Food & Science and the Company\u2019s other human nutrition businesses may include, among other things:\n\u25cf\nissues in integrating Bioriginal Food & Science\u2019s products or customers with the Company\u2019s other human nutrition businesses;\n\u25cf\nincompatibility of marketing and administration methods;\n\u25cf\nmaintaining employee morale and retaining key employees;\n\u25cf\nintegrating the cultures of both companies;\n\u25cf\npreserving important strategic customer relationships;\n\u25cf\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and information systems; and\n\u25cf\ncoordinating and integrating geographically separate organizations located in different countries.\nThe occurrence of any of the above difficulties could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operation or financial condition.\nUnfavorable publicity or consumer perception of the Company\u2019s human nutrition products could cause fluctuations in the Company\u2019s operating results and could have a material adverse effect on its reputation, the demand for its products, and its ability to generate revenues. The Company is dependent upon consumer perception of the safety and quality of its human nutrition products, as well as similar products distributed by other companies. Consumer perception of products can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, national media attention, and other publicity about product use. A product may be received favorably, resulting in high sales associated with that product that may not be sustainable as consumer preferences change. Future scientific research or publicity could be unfavorable to any of the Company\u2019s particular products and may not be consistent with earlier favorable research or publicity. Adverse publicity in the form of published scientific research or otherwise, whether or not accurate, that associates consumption of the Company\u2019s products or any other similar products with illness or other adverse effects, that questions the benefits of the Company\u2019s products or similar products, or that claims that such products are ineffective could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nCompliance with new and existing governmental regulations could increase the Company\u2019s costs significantly, reduce its growth prospects and adversely affect results of operations for its human nutrition segment. The processing, formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of the Company\u2019s human nutrition products are subject to federal laws and regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the FDA, FTC, CPSC, OSHA, E.P.A., Health Canada, CFIA and EFSA. These activities are also regulated by various state, local, and international laws and agencies of the states and localities in which the Company\u2019s products are sold. Government regulations may prevent or delay the introduction, require the reformulation, or require the discontinuance of the Company\u2019s human nutrition products, which could result in lost revenues and increased costs. For instance, the FDA regulates, among other things, the composition, safety, manufacture, labeling, and marketing of dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary ingredients for human use). The FDA may not accept the evidence of safety for any new dietary ingredient that the Company may wish to market, may determine that a particular dietary supplement or ingredient presents an unacceptable health risk, or may determine that a particular claim or statement of nutritional value that the Company uses to support the marketing of a dietary supplement is an impermissible drug claim, the claim is not substantiated, or is an unauthorized version of a qualified health claim. Any of these actions could prevent the Company from marketing particular dietary supplement ingredients in the United States or making certain claims or statements for those products. The FDA could also require the Company to remove a particular product from the market. Any future recall or removal would result in additional costs to the Company, including lost revenues from any products that the Company is required to remove from the market. Any product recalls or removals could also lead to liability, substantial costs, and reduced growth prospects.\nAdditional or more stringent regulations of dietary supplements and food products have been considered from time to time. These regulations could require reformulation of some products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of some products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of some products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, adverse event reporting, or other new requirements. Any of these developments could increase costs significantly. The Company may not be able to comply with such new regulations without incurring additional expenses, which could be significant.\nThe Company may incur material product liability claims and product recall costs, which could increase the Company\u2019s costs and adversely affect its reputation, revenues and operating income. As a manufacturer of products designed for human and animal consumption, the Company is subject to product liability claims and product recall costs if the use of the Company\u2019s human nutrition or animal nutrition products are alleged to have resulted in injury. Some Company products contain vitamins, minerals, herbs and other dietary ingredients that are not subject to pre-market regulatory approval in the United States. It is possible that some Company products could unintentionally contain contaminated substances, and some of its products contain ingredients that do not have long histories of human consumption. It is possible that previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from consumption of these ingredients could occur.\nIn addition, third-party manufacturers produce many of the products that the Company\u2019s human nutrition segment sells. As a distributor of products manufactured by third parties, the Company may also be liable for various product liability claims for products that the Company does not manufacture. Although the Company\u2019s purchase agreements with their third-party vendors typically require the vendor to indemnify the Company to the extent of any such claims, any such indemnification is limited by its terms. Moreover, as a practical matter, any such indemnification is dependent on the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and its insurer, and the absence of significant defenses by the insurers. The Company may be unable to obtain full recovery from the insurer or any indemnifying third party in respect of any claims against it in connection with products manufactured by such third party.\nIncreases in the price and shortage of supply of key raw materials could adversely affect the Company\u2019s human nutrition business. Certain of the Company\u2019s human nutrition products are composed of key raw materials that are purchased from third parties. The Company purchases its botanical raw materials from manufacturers and distributors in Asia, Europe, and North America. The Company also manufactures a substantial volume of products that are dependent on coconut raw materials as a source of supply and the Company imports these coconut raw materials from foreign countries such as the Philippines, Sri Lanka and other south-east Asian countries. These areas are susceptible to hurricanes and political instability and these factors may make these sources of supply unavailable from time to time, or available at prices that are not attractive to the Company. In addition, the Company manufactures all of its dairy protein products from dairy ingredient raw materials that it purchases from local cheese makers and dairy farmers and is completely dependent on these local sources of supply. For example, three of the Company\u2019s dairy ingredient raw material suppliers accounted for approximately 71% of the cost of its dairy ingredient raw material supply for the year ended December 31, 2016. Dairy ingredient raw material purchase arrangements are typically short-term supply contracts or spot sales agreements.\nRaw material prices may increase in the future and the Company may not be able to pass on such increases to its customers. A significant increase in the price of raw materials that cannot be passed on to customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if the Company cannot get access to key raw materials due to (i) increased regulatory scrutiny or changing regulatory standards involving dietary supplements or their ingredients or the importation of these raw materials into the United States, Canada or Europe, or (ii) lack of supply, these could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nReal or perceived quality control problems with raw materials sourced from certain regions could negatively impact consumer confidence in the Company\u2019s human nutrition products, or expose the Company to liability. In addition, although some raw materials may be available from other sources, an unexpected interruption of supply or material increases in the price of raw materials, for any reason, such as changes in economic and political conditions, tariffs, trade disputes, regulatory requirements, import restrictions, loss of certifications, acts of God or other events, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Also, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar or Euro could result in higher costs for raw materials purchased in other countries.\nThe Company\u2019s dealings in foreign countries require the Company to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions in which the Company does business. Doing business in foreign markets requires the Company and its subsidiaries to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, and the Company\u2019s failure to successfully comply with these rules and regulations may expose it to liabilities. These laws and regulations apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents, and may restrict the Company\u2019s operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In particular, the Company\u2019s international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and the U.K. Bribery Act (\u201cUKBA\u201d), the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act and the Dutch criminal code. The FCPA prohibits the Company from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and requires the Company to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect the Company\u2019s transactions. As part of the Company\u2019s business, the Company may deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of these laws. In addition, some of the international locations in which the Company does business lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption. As a result of the above activities, the Company is exposed to the risk of violating anti-corruption laws. Violations of these legal requirements are punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts as well as other remedial measures. The Company has established policies and procedures designed to assist it in complying with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s policies and procedures will effectively prevent the Company from violating these regulations in every transaction in which the Company may engage, and such a violation could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, business, results of operation or financial condition.\nComplying with healthcare reform legislation could increase the Company\u2019s costs and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. The Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010 and subsequent regulatory implementation of that legislation could significantly increase the Company\u2019s costs and have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition by requiring the Company either to provide certain kinds of mandated health insurance coverage to its employees or to pay certain penalties for electing not to provide such coverage. Because these requirements are broad, complex, subject to certain phase-in rules and which may be subject to further changes by the new Presidential administration, it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact that this legislation will have on the Company\u2019s business and operating costs. This legislation or any alternative version that may ultimately be implemented may materially increase the Company\u2019s operating costs. This legislation could also adversely affect the Company\u2019s employee relations and ability to compete for new employees if its response to this legislation is considered less favorable than the responses or health benefits offered by employers with whom the Company competes for talent.\nPresident Trump has made comments suggesting that he was not supportive of certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. At this time, it remains unclear what the new Presidential administration or Congress may do with respect to healthcare legislation or regulations, but it is possible that changes to healthcare laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe inability to protect the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights could adversely affect its business. Despite the Company\u2019s efforts, the Company may not be able to determine the extent of unauthorized use of its trademarks and patents. Such efforts are difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that infringing goods could not be manufactured without the Company\u2019s knowledge and consent. Many of the Company\u2019s products are not subject to patent protection, and therefore they can be legally reverse-engineered by competitors. From time to time the Company faces opposition to its applications to register trademarks, and the Company may not ultimately be successful in its attempts to register certain trademarks in certain jurisdictions.\nThe costs of energy may materially impact Omega Protein\u2019s business. Omega Protein has occasionally experienced substantially higher costs for energy. Omega Protein\u2019s business is materially dependent on diesel fuel for its vessels and natural gas, propane and potentially Bunker C fuel oil for its operating facilities. The costs of these commodities, which are beyond the Company\u2019s control, may have an adverse material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation.\nClimate changes may affect the Company\u2019s business. According to certain scientific studies, emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other gases commonly known as greenhouse gases may be contributing to global warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and to global climate change. It is also possible that these conditions, if they occur, would impact the spawning, feeding, migration, distribution and growth of the menhaden species and hence, the Company\u2019s fishing harvest, as well as the cost or availability of the raw materials utilized by Bioriginal. As a result, such conditions may pose increased climate-related risks to the Company\u2019s assets and operations. Due to the uncertainties surrounding the regulation of, and other risks associated with, climate issues, the Company cannot predict the financial impact of related developments on its business.\nThird party labor strikes and supply chain interruptions could adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to import certain raw materials. Certain of the Company\u2019s products are composed of raw materials that are imported from foreign manufacturers and distributors who may be subject to labor strikes, supply chain disruption and political turmoil in foreign countries. The occurrence of these sorts of adverse events could result in higher costs for raw materials purchased abroad and delivery delays to customers, and if these events continued for a sustained period of time, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation.\nRisks Relating to the Company\u2019s Operations:\nThe Company\u2019s strategy to become a fully integrated nutritional ingredient company is subject to inherent risk and may be substantially altered, depending on the results of the strategic alternatives review currently underway. The Company\u2019s strategy to become a fully integrated nutritional ingredient company and to expand the sales of its fish oil products into the markets for refined, functional foods and supplement grade fish oils for human consumption is subject to risks inherent in any business expansion. The Company\u2019s expectations regarding future demand for nutritional products may prove to be incorrect or, if future demand does meet the Company\u2019s expectations, it is possible that purchasers could utilize other nutritional products than the Company\u2019s products. In addition, the Company is now operating in areas subject to different regulations and subject to different market forces than its historical commercial fishing business, all of which makes the Company\u2019s overall business environment more complex and challenging.\nIn addition, if the strategic alternatives review process for the Company\u2019s human nutrition segment discussed in this Report were to result in a sale of that segment, then the Company\u2019s strategy to become a fully integrated nutritional ingredient company would be substantially altered.\nThe Company\u2019s implementation of a new enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system could result in problems that could negatively impact its business. The Company began implementing a new ERP system in 2014 that will support substantially all of the Company\u2019s operating and financial functions and is continuing to enhance this system in 2017. It is possible that the Company could experience problems in connection with this system, including compatibility issues, training requirements, higher than expected implementation costs and other integration challenges and delays, as the Company\u2019s employees learn the new system, transfer data from the Company\u2019s existing system to the new system and operate with the new system and its enhancements. Any difficulties that the Company encounters with this new system may disrupt the Company\u2019s operations and the Company\u2019s ability to deal effectively with the Company\u2019s employees, vendors, customers and other companies with which the Company has commercial relationships. Additionally, a significant problem with the implementation, enhancement or integration with other systems or ongoing management of an ERP system and related systems could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to generate and interpret accurate management and financial reports and other information on a timely basis, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial reporting system and internal controls and adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to manage its business or comply with various regulations.\nThe Company currently has a relatively small amount of indebtedness, but if that indebtedness were to increase, it may adversely affect its ability to operate its business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on its debt. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate amount of the Company\u2019s outstanding indebtedness under its bank credit facility and other indebtedness was approximately $1.1 million. The Company has the ability, under current and potential future credit facilities and other indebtedness, to significantly increase its outstanding indebtedness in the future and it is possible that it might do so in connection with its capital expenditure spending program, its dividend program or for other purposes. The Company\u2019s outstanding indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u25cf\nthe Company\u2019s ability to meet its expenses and debt obligations will depend on its future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. The Company will not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions and governmental regulation. The Company cannot be certain that its earnings will be sufficient to allow it to pay the principal and interest on its existing or future debt and meet its other obligations. If the Company does not have enough money to service its existing or future debt, it may be required to refinance all or part of its existing or future debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity. The Company may not be able to refinance its existing or future debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to it, if at all;\n\u25cf\nit may be more difficult for the Company to satisfy its obligations with respect to its bank credit facility and other indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of the agreements governing such indebtedness, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under such agreements;\n\u25cf\nthe covenants contained in the Company\u2019s debt agreements limit its ability to borrow money in the future for acquisitions, capital expenditures or to meet its operating expenses or other general corporate obligations;\n\u25cf\nthe amount of the Company\u2019s interest expense may increase because its borrowings are, and any future borrowings under its bank credit facility and other indebtedness would be, at variable rates of interest, which, if interest rates increase, could result in higher interest expense;\n\u25cf\nthe Company will need to use a portion of its cash flows to pay principal and interest on its debt, which will reduce the amount of money the Company has for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other business activities;\n\u25cf\nthe Company may have a higher level of debt than some of its competitors, which could put it at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u25cf\nthe Company may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in its industry or the economy in general; and\n\u25cf\nthe Company\u2019s debt level could limit its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which it operates.\nThe Company\u2019s bank credit facility contains covenants and restrictions that may limit the Company\u2019s financial flexibility. The Company\u2019s bank credit facility and other indebtedness contain various financial covenants with which the Company must comply. For more information on these bank covenants, please refer to Note 11 - Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly operating results will fluctuate as its business is seasonal in nature and subject to estimates. Omega Protein\u2019s menhaden harvesting and processing business is seasonal in nature. Omega Protein generally has higher sales during the third quarter of each fiscal year due to increased product availability and customer demand. Additionally, due to differences in gross profit margins for Omega Protein\u2019s various products, any variation in the mix of product sales between quarters may result in significant variations of total gross profit margins. Similarly, from time to time Omega Protein defers sales of inventory based on worldwide prices for competing products that affect prices for its products, which may affect comparable period comparisons. As a result, the Company\u2019s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future.\nIn addition, inventory is generally carried over from one year to the next year, and Omega Protein generally begins selling its current season\u2019s production late in the second quarter and sells that production until the second quarter of the following year. Costs can change meaningfully from one season to the next.\nFurther, Omega Protein\u2019s per unit cost of production is estimated prior to the beginning of each fishing season based on total estimated fishing costs (including off-season costs) divided by estimated total units of production. Omega Protein adjusts the cost of sales, unallocated inventory cost pool and inventory balances at the end of the second, third and fourth quarters based on revised estimates of total units of production to total inventoriable costs. Changes in estimates from one quarter to the next can have a significant impact on operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to significant competition, and some competitors have significantly greater financial resources and more extensive and diversified operations than the Company. The marine protein and oil business is subject to significant competition from producers of vegetable and other animal protein products and oil products such as Archer Daniels Midland and Cargill. In addition, Omega Protein competes with a domestic menhaden fishing company that was purchased in 2015 by a large foreign public company and with numerous fish processors outside the United States. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial resources, less onerous regulatory costs and more extensive and diversified operations than the Company.\nThe dietary supplement ingredient supplier industry is a large, highly fragmented and growing industry, with no single industry participant accounting for a majority of total industry sales. Competition is based primarily on price, quality and assortment of products, customer service, marketing support and availability of new ingredients. In addition, the market is highly sensitive to the introduction of new products. Bioriginal competes with manufacturers, distributors and marketers of dietary supplement ingredients both within and outside the United States.\nThe Company\u2019s foreign customers are subject to disruption typical to foreign countries. The Company\u2019s sales of its products in foreign countries are subject to risks associated with foreign countries such as changes in social, political and economic conditions inherent in foreign operations, including:\n\u25cf\nChanges in the law and policies that govern foreign investment and international trade in foreign countries;\n\u25cf\nChanges in U.S. laws and regulations relating to foreign investment and trade;\n\u25cf\nChanges in tax or other laws;\n\u25cf\nPartial or total expropriation;\n\u25cf\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u25cf\nRestrictions on current repatriation; or\n\u25cf\nPolitical disturbances, insurrection or war.\nIn addition, it is possible that the Company, at any one time, could have a significant amount of its revenues generated by sales in a particular country which would concentrate the Company\u2019s susceptibility to adverse events in that country. For example, in 2016, approximately 11% of the Company\u2019s revenues were derived from customers in China.\nThe Company has recorded impairment charges with respect to goodwill and other intangible assets and may be required to record additional charges to future earnings if goodwill and other intangible assets become further impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had goodwill and other intangibles assets of $26 million and $18 million, respectively, or approximately 10% of the Company\u2019s total assets in the aggregate. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed. The Company tests goodwill and other intangible assets periodically for impairment of value, and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill is greater than the fair value of that reporting unit. Due to a decline in actual earnings compared with projected results and reductions to forecasts for the Bioriginal Food & Science and WSP reporting units, the Company performed interim and annual testing of the goodwill and other intangible assets for the Bioriginal Food & Science and WSP reporting units and recorded a $12.1 million impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2016, $11.6 million of which fully impaired the goodwill recorded on the WSP reporting unit. Similarly, the Company recorded impairment charges relating to the InCon and Cyvex reporting unit totaling $4.5 million and $4.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. See Note 10 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.\nThe assessments of goodwill and other intangible assets are based on assumptions that require speculation and are highly subjective given the transitional nature of the businesses and the use of other reasonable, but different, assumptions could provide significantly different fair values and result in additional impairments. The quantitative tests have assumed increasing cash flows over the next several years, based on anticipated sales growth and improved profitability. The Company\u2019s ability to grow sales and improve profitability as expected is contingent on its ability to, among other factors, procure adequate supplies of raw materials, align product production and customer demand, and price products at appropriate margins above production or procurement costs. Considering the level of sensitivity with respect to the key assumptions, if the Company does not (i) ensure adequate supplies of raw materials, (ii) adequately anticipate changes in its customers\u2019 demand for products or (iii) price products at appropriate margins above production or procurement costs, its future cash flows may fail to meet the Company\u2019s cash flow projections. If the cash flows decline sufficiently, the estimated fair values would be reduced and the Company may be required to record additional charges to future earnings if its goodwill and other intangible assets become further impaired, which could have material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to comply with federal U.S. citizenship ownership requirements may prevent it from harvesting menhaden in the U.S. jurisdictional waters. Omega Protein\u2019s harvesting operations are subject to the Shipping Act of 1916 and the regulations promulgated there under by the Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration which require, among other things, that the Company be incorporated under the laws of the U.S. or a state, the Company\u2019s chief executive officer be a U.S. citizen, no more of the Company\u2019s directors be non-citizens than a minority of a number necessary to constitute a quorum and at least 75% of the Company\u2019s outstanding capital stock (including a majority of its voting capital stock) be owned by U.S. citizens. If the Company fails to observe any of these requirements, the Company will not be eligible to conduct its harvesting activities in U.S. jurisdictional waters which would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOmega Protein may not be able to recruit, train and retain qualified marine personnel in sufficient numbers. Omega Protein\u2019s business is dependent on its ability to recruit, train and retain qualified marine personnel in sufficient numbers such as vessel captains, vessel engineers and other crewmembers. Omega Protein has experienced difficulty from time to time, depending on labor markets, in recruiting its optimal number of employees. To the extent that Omega Protein is not successful in recruiting, training and retaining employees in sufficient numbers, its productivity may suffer. If Omega Protein were unable to secure a sufficient number of workers during periods of peak employment, the lack of personnel could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOmega Protein may face delays with, or lose access to, the United States H2B Visa Program which we rely on for qualified marine personnel. Omega Protein has historically utilized workers in the United States H2B visa program whereby foreign nationals are permitted to enter the United States temporarily and engage in seasonal, non-agricultural employment. President Trump has made comments suggesting that he was not supportive of certain aspects of the country\u2019s immigration policies but at this time, it remains unclear what the new Presidential administration or Congress may do with respect to immigration policy or specific immigration programs such as the H2B visa program. If the administration or Congress take action to modify or terminate the H2B visa program, it is possible that the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, the Company has experienced delays with the Department of Labor in connection with the Company\u2019s H2B visa submissions in recent years and for the 2017 fishing season. Based on its current assessment of the 2017 H2B visa application process, the Company believes that it may not have sufficient H2B visa workers for the 2017 fishing season that commences in April 2017. [Held to update]If Omega Protein cannot participate in the H2B Visa Program, or its participation in that program is delayed or restricted, then Omega Protein\u2019s ability to secure a sufficient number of qualified workers during periods of peak employment may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor relations matters. Certain of our employees that work on vessels at our Reedville, Virginia facility are represented by an affiliate of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. The collective bargaining agreement for these employees has a three-year term that expires in April 2017 and the Company expects to enter into discussions with the union regarding a new collective bargaining agreement prior to that date. While we have good relations with these employees and the union, we may be unsuccessful in negotiating and agreeing upon a new collective bargaining agreement at that time if the current collective bargaining agreement is terminated. We have also faced attempts to unionize our other facilities in the past, which to date have been unsuccessful. While we believe that we have good relations with our workforce, we may experience work stoppages or other labor problems in the future, and it is possible that further unionization efforts may be successful. Any prolonged work stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe Company may undertake acquisitions that may be unsuccessful and the Company\u2019s inability to control the inherent risks of acquiring businesses could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. In the future the Company may undertake acquisitions of other businesses, located either in the United States or in other countries, although there can be no assurances that this will occur. The Company had not made any acquisitions until its acquisitions of Cyvex in December 2010, InCon in September 2011, WSP in February 2013 and Bioriginal Food & Science in September 2014. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able (i) to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on favorable terms, (ii) to profitably manage recent acquisitions, or future businesses it may acquire, or (iii) to successfully integrate recent acquisitions or future businesses it may acquire without substantial costs, delays or other problems. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company may undertake the spending of additional growth capital in its animal nutrition division that may be unsuccessful and this could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. In the future the Company may undertake the spending of additional growth capital in its animal nutrition division. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to identify attractive capital growth projects or implement such projects successfully or profitably, and any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInvestment Risks. Investment risks specifically related to the Company\u2019s common stock include:\nUncertain economic conditions may have material adverse impacts on the Company\u2019s business, results of operation and financial condition that the Company currently cannot predict. As widely reported, economic conditions in the United States and globally drastically deteriorated during 2008 and 2009. Financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia experienced a period of turmoil and upheaval characterized by extreme volatility and declines in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, inability to access capital markets, the bankruptcy, failure, collapse or sale of various financial institutions, European sovereign debt issues and an unprecedented level of intervention from the United States federal government and other governments. Although many of these factors have changed by varying degrees during the following years, the Company cannot predict whether future similar events will occur or will materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operation and financial condition.\nFor example, it is possible that in the future:\n\u25cf\nthe Company may not be able to obtain modifications to the financial covenants under the bank credit facility and other indebtedness, if necessary, on acceptable terms, if at all;\n\u25cf\nthe demand for fishmeal and oil may decline due to the uncertain economic conditions which could negatively impact the revenues, margins and profitability of the Company\u2019s business;\n\u25cf\nthe Company may be unable to obtain adequate funding under the bank credit facility and other indebtedness or future credit agreements due to lending counterparties being unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations;\n\u25cf\nthe tightening of credit or lack of credit availability to the Company\u2019s customers could adversely affect its ability to collect trade receivables;\n\u25cf\nthe Company\u2019s ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when the Company would like, or need, to raise capital for its business including for capital expenditures or acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the value of plan assets for the Company\u2019s defined benefit plan may result in increased benefit costs and may increase the amount and accelerate the timing of required future contributions; or\n\u25cf\nthe Company\u2019s commodity hedging arrangements could become ineffective if the Company\u2019s counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection.\nThe limited liquidity for the Company\u2019s common stock could affect shareholders\u2019 ability to sell shares at a satisfactory price. The Company\u2019s common stock is relatively illiquid. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately 22.4 million shares of common stock outstanding. The average daily trading volume in the common stock during the prior 60 calendar days ending on that date was approximately 133,000 shares. A more active public market for the Company\u2019s common stock, however, may not develop, which would continue to adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of the common stock. Moreover, a thin trading market for the common stock could cause the market price for the common stock to fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a large float, the Company\u2019s common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of the common stock may be more volatile. In addition, in the absence of an active public trading market, shareholders may be unable to liquidate their investment in the Company at a satisfactory price.\nIssuance of shares in connection with financing transactions or under stock incentive plans will dilute current stockholders. Pursuant to the Company\u2019s stock incentive plans, the Company\u2019s management is authorized to grant stock awards to its employees, directors and consultants. Stockholders will incur dilution upon exercise of any outstanding stock awards. In addition, if the Company raises additional funds by issuing additional common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock, further dilution to its existing stockholders will result, and new investors could have rights superior to existing stockholders.\nThe number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect the market price of its stock. The Company had outstanding options to purchase approximately 451,000 shares of its common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $7.34 per share as of December 31, 2016. These shares of common stock are registered for resale on currently effective registration statements. Certain of the Company\u2019s officers and directors have from time to time in the past entered into, and in the future may enter into, Rule 10b5-1 sales plans with brokers unaffiliated with the Company whereby they commit to sell automatically and without discretion a predetermined number of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock over a period of time according to their own individual criteria. The issuance of a significant number of shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options, or the availability for sale, or sale, of a substantial number of the shares of common stock eligible for future sale under effective registration statements, Rule 10b5-1 plans, under Rule 144 or otherwise, could adversely affect the market price of the common stock.\nUnder the Company\u2019s securities trading policy, Rule 10b5-1 stock sales or purchase plans are required to be approved by the Company for directors, officers and certain key employees. The Company expects that public disclosure regarding purchases or sales under these Rule 10b5-1 plans will be provided through Form 4 and Rule 144 filings with the SEC. The Company does not intend to disclose further information regarding the existence or terms of these trading plans for individual participants.\nThe Company\u2019s share repurchase program may not enhance long-term stockholder value and share repurchases, if any, could increase the volatility of the price of the Company\u2019s common stock and will diminish its cash reserves. In May 2016, the Company announced a share repurchase program of up to $40 million over the next 3 years. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased, if any, depend on a variety of factors including the timing of open trading windows, market and business conditions, stock price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The Company can suspend or terminate the program at any time, and subject to applicable law, may also amend the terms of the program at any time. To date, the Company has not purchased any shares under the purchase criteria established for the share repurchase program. In February 2017, the Company suspended the repurchase of shares under the share repurchase program in connection with its previously announced strategic review of its human nutrition segment.\nRepurchases pursuant to the Company\u2019s share repurchase program could affect the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock and increase its volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program could also cause the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for the Company\u2019s common stock. Additionally, repurchases under the Company\u2019s share repurchase program will diminish the Company\u2019s cash reserves, which could impact the Company\u2019s ability to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions and could result in lower overall returns on the Company\u2019s cash balances. The Company cannot assure investors that any further share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock may decline below the levels at which the Company repurchased shares of stock. Although the Company\u2019s share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program\u2019s effectiveness.\nThe Company cannot guarantee that it will continue to make dividend payments. Although the Company\u2019s Board of Directors has recently initiated a quarterly cash dividend payable on the Company\u2019s common stock, any determinations to continue to pay cash dividends will be based primarily upon the Company\u2019s operating results, financial condition, capital requirements, available cash, general business conditions and such other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant, including the Board of Directors\u2019 continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of stockholders and is in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to dividend payments.\nProvisions of the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, as well as Nevada and federal law, could delay or prevent corporate takeovers and could prevent stockholders from realizing a premium on their investment. Certain provisions of the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws as well as the Nevada Corporation Law, could delay or frustrate the removal of incumbent directors and could make difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving the Company, even if such events could be viewed as beneficial by its stockholders. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors is empowered to issue preferred stock or rights in one or more series without stockholder action. Any issuance of this blank-check preferred stock could materially limit the rights of holders of the Company\u2019s common stock and render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Company by means of a tender offer, merger, proxy contest or otherwise. In addition, the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain a number of provisions which could impede a takeover or change in control of the Company, including, among other things, staggered terms for members of its Board of Directors, the requiring of two-thirds vote of stockholders to amend certain provisions of the Articles of Incorporation or the inability to take action by written consent or to call special stockholder meetings. Certain provisions of the Nevada Corporation Law could also discourage takeover attempts that have not been approved by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. In addition, federal law requires that at least 75% of the Company\u2019s outstanding capital stock be owned by U.S. citizens which could discourage takeover attempts by potential foreign purchasers.", "PERMNO": 85951, "SIC": 2070, "TIC": "OME"}
