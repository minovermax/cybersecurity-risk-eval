{"cik": "1137547", "company": "UNITED SECURITY BANCSHARES", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes may affect our business are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our business. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may adversely impact our business operations. If any of the events described in the following risk factors occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially\nadversely affected. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of the events described in these risk factors.\nRisks Relating to Our Bank and to the Business of Banking in General\nDeterioration of economic conditions could adversely affect our business.\nWe conduct banking operations principally in California\u2019s Central Valley. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to changes in the economic conditions in California\u2019s Central Valley. Our business results are dependent in large part upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in the Central Valley, and adverse economic conditions could have a material adverse effect upon us. In addition, the Central Valley remains largely dependent on agriculture. A downturn in agriculture and agricultural related business could indirectly and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe can provide no assurance that economic conditions in the United States in general and in the State of California and within our operating markets will not deteriorate or that such deterioration will not materially affect us. A deterioration in economic conditions locally, regionally or nationally could result in an economic downturn in the Central Valley with the following consequences, any of which could further adversely affect our business:\n\u2022\nLoan delinquencies and defaults may increase;\n\u2022\nProblem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\nDemand for loans or other products and services offered by us may decline;\n\u2022\nLow cost or noninterest bearing deposits may decrease;\n\u2022\nDecline in the value of our loans or other assets secured by real estate could occur;\n\u2022\nForeclosed assets may not be able to be sold;\n\u2022\nDecrease in our stock price;\n\u2022\nAn impairment of goodwill or certain intangible assets; or\n\u2022\nAn increase in operating expenses associated with attending to the effects of the above-listed circumstances.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nThe risk of credit losses on loans and leases varies with, among other things, general economic conditions, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower, and, in the case of collateralized loans, the value and marketability of the collateral. We maintain an allowance for loan losses based upon, among other things, historical experience, an evaluation of economic conditions, and regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality. Based upon such factors, our management makes various assumptions and determinations about the ultimate collectability of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific loans where their collectability is considered to be questionable.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our allowance for loan losses was $8,395,000, representing 1.43% of outstanding loans. While we believe that our allowance for loan losses is appropriate for the risk identified in our loans and lease portfolio, we cannot assure you that we will not further increase the allowance for loan losses, that it will be sufficient to address losses we actually incur, or that regulators will not require us to increase this allowance. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \"Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for more information.\nOur concentration of commercial real estate, construction and land development, and commercial and industrial loans exposes us to increased lending risks.\nCommercial real estate, construction and land development, and commercial and industrial loans, which comprised approximately 67% of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018, expose us to a greater risk of loss than residential real estate and consumer loans, which were a smaller percentage of the total loan portfolio. Commercial real estate and land development loans typically involve relatively large balances to a borrower or a group of related borrowers, and an adverse development with respect to a larger commercial loan relationship would expose us to greater risk of loss than would an adverse development with respect to a smaller residential mortgage loan or consumer loan.\nIf any particular industry or market sector were to experience economic difficulties, the overall timing and amount of collections on our loans to clients operating in those industries may differ from what we expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we foreclose on collateral property, we may be subject to the increased costs associated with the ownership of real property, resulting in reduced revenues.\nWe may need to foreclose on collateral property to protect our investment and may thereafter own and operate such property, in which case we will be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. The amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to: (i) general or local economic conditions; (ii) neighborhood values; (iii) interest rates; (iv) real estate tax rates; (v) operating expenses of the mortgaged properties; (vi) environmental remediation liabilities; (vii) ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties; (viii) zoning laws; (ix) governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies; and (x) natural calamities. Certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs, may adversely affect the income from the real estate, and as a result, we may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss. The foregoing expenditures and costs could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues, resulting in reduced levels of profitability.\nOur financial performance is subject to interest rate risk.\nOur operations are greatly influenced by general economic conditions and by related monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government. Deposit flows and funding costs are influenced by interest rates of competing investments and general market rates of interest. Lending activities are affected by the demand for loans, which in turn is affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered or by other factors affecting the availability of funds.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income received from interest-earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest-bearing liabilities. To reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, management seeks to manage the balances of interest sensitive assets and liabilities, and maintain appropriate maturity and repricing parameters for these assets and liabilities. A mismatch between the amount of rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities in any time period may expose us to interest rate risk. Generally, if rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities, the net interest margin will be positively impacted during a rising rate environment and negatively impacted during a declining rate environment. When rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets, the net interest margin will generally be positively impacted during a declining rate environment and negatively impacted during a rising rate environment. Increases in interest rates may reduce the overall level of loans we originate, and, thus, the amount of loan and commitment fees earned, as well as the market value of investment securities and other interest-earning assets. Moreover, fluctuations in interest rates may also result in disintermediation, which is the flow of funds away from depository institutions into direct investments, such as corporate securities and other investment vehicles which, because of the absence of federal deposit insurance, generally pay higher rates of return than depository institutions.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws and regulations. Regulations may prevent or impair our ability to pay dividends, engage in acquisitions or operate in other ways.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities. Any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on us and our operations. Additional legislation and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect our powers, authority and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, regulators have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. The exercise of this regulatory discretion and power may have a negative impact on us.\nIf we cannot attract deposits, our growth may be inhibited.\nOur ability to increase our assets depends in large part on our ability to attract additional deposits at favorable rates. We intend to seek additional deposits by offering deposit products that are competitive with those offered by other financial institutions in our markets and by establishing personal relationships with our customers. We provide no assurances that these efforts will be successful. Our inability to attract additional deposits at competitive rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to our success.\nOur employees are our most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. We endeavor to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees to assist in executing our growth, acquisition, and business strategies. If for any reason we are unable to continue to attract or retain qualified employees, our performance, including our competitive position, could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur controls over financial reporting and related governance procedures may fail or be circumvented. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the value of our common stock.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. We maintain controls and procedures to mitigate risks such as processing system failures or errors and customer or employee fraud, and we maintain insurance coverage for certain of these risks. Any system of controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and provides only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Events could occur which are not prevented or detected by our internal controls, are not insured against, or are in excess of our insurance limits. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur decisions regarding the fair value of assets acquired could be inaccurate which could materially and adversly affect our business, financial condition, result of operation, and future prospects.\nTo comply with U.S. GAAP, our management must exercise judgment in selecting, determining, and applying accounting methods, assumptions, and estimates. Management makes various estimates and judgments about the collectability of acquired loans, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans. If the actual performance of the acquired loans and/or the value of the collateral differs materially from management's estimates, any resulting losses or increased credit loss provisions could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards may affect our performance.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. The FASB and SEC continually change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can materially impact how we report and record our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in a retrospective adjustment to prior financial statements.\nOne such change is ASU 2016-13, which was released by the FASB in 2016 and which the Company is required to adopt no later than January 1, 2020. Currently, the impairment model used by financial institutions is based on incurred losses, and loans are recognized as impaired when there is no longer an assumption that future cash flows will be collected in full under the originally contracted terms. This model will be replaced by the current expected credit loss (\"CECL\") model, in which financial institutions will be required to use historical information, current conditions and reasonable forecasts to estimate the expected loss over the life of the loan. The transition to the CECL model will necessitate significantly greater data requirements and changes to methodologies to accurately account for expected losses over the life of a loan. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to increase our reserves and allowance for loan loss as a result of the implementation of CECL. Increased provisions for loan losses may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on communications, information, operating and financial control systems technology and we may suffer an interruption in or breach of the security of those systems.\nThe financial services industry is experiencing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we do. Our future success will depend, to some degree, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as create additional efficiencies in our operations, We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products or service, or be successful in marketing such products and services. Additionally, the implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems and integrate new ones may cause service interruptions, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays, and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws. Even with extraordinary care, due to the extensive work by computer hackers and others, we are also subject to potential data breaches that may result in revealing confidential information. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage the risks associated with increased dependency on technology.\nOur business is highly reliant on technology and our ability and our third party service providers to manage the operational risks associated with technology.\nWe depend, and will continue to depend to a significant extent, on in-house hosted software and on a number of relationships with third party technology service providers. Specifically, we utilize software and hardware systems for transaction processing, essential web hosting, debit card processing, merchant bankcard processing, internet banking systems and other processing services from third party service providers. If these third party service providers experience difficulties or terminate their services, and we are unable to replace them with other qualified service providers, or we experience turnover of key staff, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nWe rely on certain third parties to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations, such as data processing and storage, recording and monitoring transactions, on-line banking interfaces and services, Internet connections, telecommunications, and network access. Even though we have a vendor management program to help us carefully select and monitor the performance of third parties, we do not control their actions. The failure of a third-party to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements as a result of changes in the third party\u2019s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services, strategic focus, system interruption or breaches, or for any other reason, could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to liquidity risk, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business. Although we have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet commitments under various economic conditions, an inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of investment securities and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market disruption, a decrease in the borrowing capacity assigned to our pledged assets by our secured creditors, or adverse regulatory action against us. Deterioration in economic conditions and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase our cost of funding and limit our access to some of our customary sources of liquidity, including, but not limited to, inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the FRBSF. Our ability to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry generally as a result of conditions faced by banking organizations in the domestic and international credit markets.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in the actual or perceived soundness or condition of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial and financial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial institutions are closely related as a result of trading, investment, liquidity management, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. Loss of public confidence in any one institution, including through default, could lead to liquidity and credit problems, losses, or defaults for other institutions. Even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of, or questions about, a counterparty may lead to market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses, or defaults by various institutions. This systemic risk may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, banks and exchanges we interact with on a daily basis or key funding providers such as the Federal Home Loan Banks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Dividends and our Common Stock\nOur future ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions.\nAs a holding company with no significant assets other than the Bank, we depend on dividends from the Bank to fund our operating expense, payments of interest on our junior subordinated debentures, and estimated tax payments. Our ability to continue to pay dividends depends in large part upon our receipt of dividends or other capital distributions from the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends or make other capital distributions to us is subject to the restrictions in the California Financial Code. In addition, it is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the FRB, the FDIC and/or the DBO could assert that payment of dividends or other payments is an unsafe or unsound practice. The amount that the Bank may pay in dividends is further restricted due to the fact that the Bank must maintain a certain minimum amount of capital to be considered a \u201cwell capitalized\u201d institution as well as a separate capital conservation buffer, as further\ndescribed under \u201cItem 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Operations - Regulatory Matters- Dividends\u201d in this report.\nIn the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Holding Company, it is likely that we, in turn, would have to discontinue capital distributions in the form of dividends or share repurchases and may have difficulty meeting our other financial obligations, including payments in respect of any outstanding indebtedness or subordinated debentures. The inability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Holding Company could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the market price of our common stock.\nOur Holding Company expenses and obligations with respect to our trust preferred securities and corresponding junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by us may also limit or impair our ability to declare or pay dividends.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Bank paid approximately $6,947,000 in dividends to our Holding Company. No assurances can be given that our future performance will justify the payment of dividends in any particular year.\nOur holding company expenses and obligations with respect to our trust preferred securities and corresponding junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by us may limit or impair our ability to declare or pay dividends. No assurance can be given that our future performance will justify the payment of dividends in any particular year. Finally, our ability to pay dividends is also subject to the restrictions of the California Corporations Code.\nWe may issue additional common stock or other equity securities in the future which could dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders.\nIn order to maintain our capital at desired or regulatory-required levels, or to fund future growth, our board of directors may decide from time to time to issue additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into, exchangeable for, or representing rights to acquire shares of our common stock. The sale of these shares may significantly dilute your ownership interest as a shareholder. New investors in the future may also have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our current shareholders which may adversely impact our current shareholders\nHolders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our common shareholders.\nOn July 25, 2007 we issued $15,464,000 of floating rate junior subordinated debentures in connection with a $15,000,000 trust preferred securities issuance by its subsidiary, United Security Bancshares Capital Trust II. At December 31, 2017, the contractual principal balance of our debentures relating to its trust preferred securities is $12,000,000. The junior subordinated debentures mature in July 2037.\nWe conditionally guarantee payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities. Our junior subordinated debentures are senior to holders of common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of common stock.", "PERMNO": 88984, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "UBFO"}
