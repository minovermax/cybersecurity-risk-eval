RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Corporation\u2019s common stock and the Corporation\u2019s financial results are subject to a number of risks. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference. Additional risks and uncertainties, including those generally affecting the industry in which the Corporation operates and risks that management currently deems immaterial, may arise or become material in the future and affect the Corporation\u2019s business.\nAs a bank holding company, adverse conditions in the general business or economic environment could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operation.\nWeaknesses or adverse changes in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the markets in which the Corporation operates could adversely impact our business, including causing one or more of the following negative developments:\n\u00b7 a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Corporation;\n\u00b7 a decrease in the value of the Corporation\u2019s loans secured by consumer or commercial real estate;\n\u00b7 an impairment of the Corporation\u2019s assets, such as its intangible assets, goodwill, or deferred tax\nassets; or\n\u00b7 an increase in the number of customers or other counterparties who default on their loans or other\nobligations to the Corporation, which could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net\ncharge-offs and provision for loan losses.\nFor example, if the Corporation is unable to continue to generate, or demonstrate that it can continue to generate, sufficient taxable income in the near future, then it may not be able to fully realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets. Such a development, or one or more other negative developments resulting from adverse conditions in the general business or economic environment, some of which are described above, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation\u2019s ability to raise capital could be limited, affect its liquidity, and could be dilutive to existing stockholders.\nCurrent conditions in the capital markets are such that traditional sources of capital may not be available to the Corporation on reasonable terms if it needed to raise capital. In such case, there is no guarantee that the Corporation will be able to borrow funds or successfully raise additional capital at all or on terms that are favorable or otherwise not dilutive to existing stockholders.\nLiquidity is essential to the Corporation\u2019s businesses and it relies on external sources to finance a significant portion of its operations.\nLiquidity is essential to the Corporation\u2019s businesses. The Corporation\u2019s capital resources and liquidity could be negatively impacted by disruptions in its ability to access these sources of funding. Factors that the Corporation cannot control, such as disruption of the financial markets or negative views about the financial services industry generally, could impair its ability to raise funding. Other financial institutions may be unwilling to extend credit to banks because of concerns about the banking industry and the economy generally and there may not be a viable market for raising short or long-term debt or equity capital. In addition, the Corporation\u2019s ability to raise funding could be impaired if lenders develop a negative perception of its long-term or short-term financial prospects. Such negative perceptions could be developed if the Corporation is downgraded or put on (or remains on) negative watch by the rating agencies, suffers a decline in the level of its business activity or regulatory authorities take significant action against it, among other reasons. If the Corporation is unable to raise funding using the methods described above, it would likely need to finance or liquidate unencumbered assets to meet maturing liabilities. The Corporation may be unable to sell some of its assets, or it may have to sell assets at a discount from market value, either of which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Corporation\u2019s construction and land development loans are subject to unique risks that could adversely affect earnings.\nThe Corporation\u2019s construction and land development loan portfolio was $26.0 million at December 31, 2016, comprising 8.9% of total loans. Construction and land development loans are often riskier than home equity loans or residential mortgage loans to individuals. In the event of a general economic slowdown, they would represent higher risk due to slower sales and reduced cash flow that could impact the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay on a timely basis. In addition, although regulations and regulatory policies affecting banks and financial services companies undergo continuous change and we cannot predict when changes will occur or the ultimate effect of any changes, there has been recent regulatory focus on construction, development and other commercial real estate lending. Federal policies applicable to construction, development or other commercial real estate loans make us subject to substantial limitations with respect to making such loans, increase the costs of making such loans, and require us to have a greater amount of capital to support this kind of lending, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability or financial condition.\nRecent performance may not be indicative of future performance.\nVarious factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory and legislative considerations, competition and the ability to find and retain talented people, may impede the Corporation\u2019s ability to remain profitable.\nDeterioration in asset quality could have an adverse impact on the Corporation.\nA significant source of risk for the Corporation arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained because borrowers, guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans. With respect to secured loans, the collateral securing the repayment of these loans includes a wide variety of diverse real and personal property that may be affected by changes in prevailing economic, environmental and other conditions, including declines in the value of real estate, changes in interest rates, changes in monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government, environmental contamination and other external events. In addition, decreases in real estate property values due to the nature of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio, over 74% of which is secured by real estate, could affect the ability of customers to repay their loans. The Bank\u2019s loan policies and procedures may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nChanges in prevailing interest rates may negatively affect the results of operations of the Corporation and the value of its assets.\nThe Corporation\u2019s earnings depend largely on the relationship between the yield on earning assets, primarily loans and investments, and the cost of funds, primarily deposits and borrowings. This relationship, known as the interest rate spread, is subject to fluctuation and is affected by economic and competitive factors which influence interest rates, the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the level of nonperforming assets. Fluctuations in interest rates affect the demand of customers for the Corporation\u2019s products and services. In addition, interest-bearing liabilities may re-price or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than interest-earning assets. Significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nChanges in the level of interest rates may also negatively affect the value of the Corporation\u2019s assets and its ability to realize book value from the sale of those assets, all of which ultimately affect earnings.\nIf the Corporation\u2019s allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, earnings would decrease.\nThe Bank\u2019s loan customers may not repay their loans according to their terms and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to assure repayment. The Bank may experience significant loan losses which would have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s operating results. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. The Corporation maintains an allowance for loan losses in an attempt to cover any loan losses inherent in the portfolio. In determining the size of the allowance, management relies on an analysis of the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and types of loans, trends in classification, volume and trends in delinquencies and nonaccruals, national and local economic conditions and other pertinent information. As a result of these considerations, the Corporation has from time to time increased its allowance for loan losses. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Corporation recorded an allowance for possible loan losses of $3.12 million, compared with $3.03 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. If those assumptions are incorrect, the allowance may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in the loan portfolio.\nThe Corporation may be subject to losses due to fraudulent and negligent conduct of the Bank\u2019s loan customers, third party service providers and employees.\nWhen the Bank make loans to individuals or entities, they rely upon information supplied by borrowers and other third parties, including information contained in the applicant\u2019s loan application, property appraisal reports, title information and the borrower\u2019s net worth, liquidity and cash flow information. While they attempt to verify information provided through available sources, they cannot be certain all such information is correct or complete. The Bank\u2019s reliance on incorrect or incomplete information could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s profitability or financial condition.\nTechnology difficulties or failures or cyber security breaches of our network security could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation.\nThe Corporation depends upon data processing, software, and communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks. The computer platforms and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen hardware and cyber security issues. The Corporation cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to cyber-attack or other technological difficulties or failures. The Corporation relies on the services of a variety of vendors to meet its data processing and communication needs. If information security is breached or other technology difficulties or failures occur, information may be lost or misappropriated, services and operations may be interrupted and the Corporation could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customers and expose us to claims from customers. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe Corporation\u2019s business is subject to the success of the local economies and real estate markets in which it operates.\nThe Corporation\u2019s banking operations are located in southwest Georgia. Because of the geographic concentration of its operations, the Corporation\u2019s success depends largely upon economic conditions in this area, which include volatility in the agricultural market, influx and outflow of major employers in the area, and minimal population growth throughout the region. Deterioration in economic conditions in the communities in which the Corporation operates could adversely affect the quality of the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio and the demand for its products and services, and accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The Corporation is less able than a larger institution to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of more diverse economies.\nThe Corporation may face risks with respect to its ability to execute its business strategy.\nThe financial performance and profitability of the Corporation will depend on its ability to execute its strategic plan and manage its future growth. Moreover, the Corporation\u2019s future performance is subject to a number of factors beyond its control, including pending and future federal and state banking legislation, regulatory changes, unforeseen litigation outcomes, inflation, lending and deposit rate changes, interest rate fluctuations, increased competition and economic conditions. Accordingly, these issues could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe Corporation depends on its key personnel, and the loss of any of them could adversely affect the Corporation.\nThe Corporation\u2019s success depends to a significant extent on the management skills of its existing executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with the Corporation for many years. The loss or unavailability of any of its key personnel, including DeWitt Drew, President and CEO; John J. Cole, Jr., Executive Vice President and COO; Jeffery E. Hanson, Executive Vice President and CBO; George R. Kirkland, Executive Vice President & CFO; and Danny E. Singley, Executive Vice President and CCO, could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations or liquidity.\nCompetition from financial institutions and other financial service providers may adversely affect the Corporation.\nThe banking business is highly competitive, and the Corporation experiences competition in its markets from many other financial institutions. The Corporation competes with these other financial institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. Many of its competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions that are able to operate profitably with a narrower net interest margin and have a more diverse revenue base. The Corporation may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of its smaller size, lack of geographic diversification and inability to spread costs across broader markets. There can be no assurance that the Corporation will be able to compete effectively in its markets. Furthermore, developments increasing the nature or level of competition could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements is uncertain.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules include new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which are being phased in and modify the capital and asset definitions for purposes of calculating those ratios. Among other things, the Basel III Capital Rules established a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement of 4.5%, a higher minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets requirement of 6% and Total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%. In addition, the final rules provided, to be considered \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d, a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement of 6.5% or greater and a higher Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets requirement of 8% or greater. Moreover, the final rules limit a banking organization\u2019s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if such banking organization does not hold a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d consisting of a 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital in addition to the 4.5% minimum common equity Tier 1 requirement and the other amounts necessary to meet the minimum risk-based capital requirements that will be phased in and fully effective in 2019.\nThe application of the more stringent capital requirements described above could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital, and result in additional regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in us modifying our business strategy and could limit our ability to make dividends.\nChanges in government regulation or monetary policy could adversely affect the Corporation.\nThe Corporation and the banking industry are subject to extensive regulation and supervision under federal and state laws and regulations. The restrictions imposed by such laws and regulations limit the manner in which the Corporation conducts its banking business, undertakes new investments and activities and obtains financing. These regulations are designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and consumers and not to benefit holders of the Corporation\u2019s securities. Financial institution regulation has been the subject of significant legislation in recent years and may be the subject of further significant legislation in the future, none of which is in the control of the Corporation. Significant new laws or changes in, or repeals of, existing laws could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Further, federal monetary policy, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve, significantly affects credit conditions for the Corporation, and any unfavorable change in these conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
