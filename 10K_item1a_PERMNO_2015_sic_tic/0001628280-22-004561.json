{"cik": "913241", "company": "STEVEN MADDEN, LTD.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties we describe below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding to invest in, sell or retain shares of our common stock. These are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Other sections of this report may discuss factors that could adversely affect our business. Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change. There may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not currently know about, that we currently believe are immaterial, or that we have not predicted, which may also harm our business or adversely affect us. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially harmed.\nCOVID-19 RISKS\nThe current COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and related government, private sector, and individual consumer responsive actions have and could continue to affect our business operations, store traffic, employee availability, supply chain, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flow.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. COVID-19 has impacted our business and operations, and we expect this to continue and could adversely impact our financial results.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused health officials to impose restrictions and recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, especially when congregating in heavily populated areas, such as malls. Our stores have experienced temporary closures, and we have implemented precautionary measures in line with guidance from local authorities in the stores that are open. These measures include restrictions such as limitations on the number of guests allowed in our stores at any single time, minimum physical distancing requirements, and limited operating hours. We do not know how the measures recommended by local authorities or implemented by us may change over time or what the duration of these restrictions will be.\nFurther resurgences in COVID-19 cases, including from variants, could cause additional restrictions, including temporarily closing all or some of our stores again. An outbreak at one of our locations, could negatively impact our employees, customers and financial results. There is uncertainty over the impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. and global economies, consumer willingness to visit stores and malls, and employee willingness to staff our stores as the pandemic continues and if there are future resurgences. There is also uncertainty regarding potential long-term changes to consumer shopping behavior and preferences and whether consumer demand will recover when restrictions are lifted.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also has the potential to significantly impact our supply chain if the factories that manufacture our products, the distribution centers where we manage our inventory, or the operations of our logistics and other service providers are disrupted, temporarily closed, or experience worker shortages. In particular, we have seen disruptions and delays in lead times and we may see increases in the pricing of certain components of our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 situation is changing rapidly and the extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and its variants and the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact, including vaccinations.\nINDUSTRY RISKS\nThe fashion footwear, accessories and apparel industry is subject to rapid changes in consumer preferences. If we do not accurately anticipate fashion trends and promptly respond to consumer demand, we could lose sales, our relationships with customers could be harmed and our brand loyalty could be diminished.\nThe strength of our brands and our success depends in significant part upon our ability to anticipate and promptly respond to product and fashion trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. There can be no assurance that our products will correspond to the changes in taste and demand or that we will be able to successfully advertise and market products that respond to trends and customer preferences. If we misjudge the market for our products, we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities as to others. In addition, misjudgments in merchandise selection could adversely affect our image with our customers resulting in lower sales and increased markdown allowances for customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe face intense competition from both established companies and newer entrants into the market. Our failure to compete effectively could cause our market share to decline, which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nThe fashion footwear, accessories and apparel industry is highly competitive and barriers to entry are low. Our competitors include specialty companies as well as companies with diversified product lines. Market growth in the sales of fashion footwear, accessories and apparel has encouraged the entry of many new competitors and increased competition from established companies. Many of these competitors, including Aldo, Sam Edelman, Lucky Brand and Vince Camuto, may have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with these and other fashion footwear, accessories and apparel companies. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, increased marketing expenditures and loss of market share and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nIf we and the retailers that are our customers are unable to adapt to recent and anticipated changes in the retail industry, the sales of our products may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nIn recent years, the retail industry has experienced consolidation and other ownership changes. In the future, retailers in the United States and in foreign markets may further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations, or realign their affiliations, any of which could decrease the number of stores that carry our or our licensees\u2019 products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry. Changing shopping patterns, including the rapid expansion of online retail shopping and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected customer traffic in mall and outlet centers, particularly in North America. We expect competition in the e-commerce market will intensify. As a greater portion of consumer expenditures with retailers occurs online and through mobile commerce applications, our brick-and-mortar retail customers who fail to successfully integrate their physical retail stores and digital retail may experience financial difficulties, including store closures, bankruptcies or liquidations. A continuation or worsening of these trends could cause financial difficulties for one or more of our major customers, which, in turn, could substantially increase our credit risk and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We have little or no control over how our customers will respond to the challenges posed by these changes in the retail industry. Our success will be determined, in part, on our and our customers\u2019 ability to manage the impact of the rapidly changing retail environment and identify and capitalize on retail trends, including technology, e-commerce and other process efficiencies that will better service our customers. If we and our customers fail to compete successfully, our businesses, market share, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMPANY\nThe loss of Steve Madden, our founder and Creative and Design Chief, or members of our executive management team could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe growth and success of our Company since its inception more than a quarter century ago is attributable, to a significant degree, to the talents, skills and efforts of our founder and Creative and Design Chief, Steven Madden. An extended or permanent loss of the services of Mr. Madden could severely disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our Company. We also depend on the contributions of the members of our senior management team. Our senior executives have substantial experience and expertise in our business and industry and have made significant contributions to our growth and success. Competition for executive talent in the fashion footwear, accessories and apparel industries is intense. While our employment agreements with Mr. Madden and most of our senior executives include a non-compete provision in the event of the termination of employment, the non-compete periods are of limited duration and scope. Although we believe we have depth within our senior management team, if we were to lose the services of Mr. Madden or any of our senior executives, and especially if any of these individuals were to join a competitor or form a competing company, our business and financial performance could be seriously harmed. A loss of the skills, industry knowledge, contacts and expertise of Mr. Madden or any of our senior executives could cause a setback to our operating plan and strategy.\nIf we are not successful in implementing our growth strategy or integrating acquired businesses, we may not be able to take advantage of certain market opportunities and may become less competitive.\nOur business has grown organically and as a result of business acquisitions. In order to gain from our acquisitions, we must be effective in integrating the businesses acquired into our overall operations. Further, the expansion of our operations has increased and will continue to increase the demand on our managerial, operational and administrative resources. In recent years, we have invested significant resources in, among other things, our management information systems and hiring and training of new personnel. However, in order to manage currently anticipated levels of future demand, we may be required to, among other\nthings, expand our distribution facilities, establish relationships with new manufacturers to produce our products and continue to expand and improve our financial, management and operating systems. We may experience difficulty integrating acquired businesses into our operations and may not achieve anticipated synergies from such integration. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage future growth effectively and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nIf one or more of our significant customers were to reduce or stop purchases of our products, our sales and profits could decline.\nThe retailers that are our customers consist principally of department stores, specialty stores, luxury retailers, value priced retailers, national chains, mass merchants, and pure-play e-commerce retailers. Certain of our department store customers, including some under common ownership, account for significant portions of our wholesale business. We generally enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our customers for each of our lines every season and do not enter into long-term agreements with any of our customers. Therefore, a decision by a significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from us or to change its manner of doing business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur financial results are subject to quarterly fluctuations.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022the timing of larger shipments of products;\n\u2022market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022the mix, pricing and presentation of the products offered and sold;\n\u2022the hiring and training of additional personnel;\n\u2022inventory write downs for obsolescence;\n\u2022the cost of materials;\n\u2022the product mix between wholesale, retail and licensing businesses;\n\u2022the incurrence of other operating costs;\n\u2022factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, declines in consumer confidence and actions of competitors;\n\u2022the timing of holidays; and\n\u2022weather conditions.\nIn addition, we expect that our sales and operating results may be significantly impacted by the opening of new retail stores and the introduction of new products. Accordingly, the results of operations in any quarter will not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter.\nExtreme or unseasonable weather conditions in locations where we or our customers and suppliers are located could adversely affect our business.\nOur corporate headquarters and principal operational locations, including retail, distribution and warehousing facilities, may be subject to natural disasters and other severe weather and geological events that could disrupt our operations. The occurrence of such natural events may result in sudden disruptions in business conditions of the local economies affected, as well as of the regional and global economies. Such disruptions may result in decreased demand for our products and disruptions in our management functions, sales channels and manufacturing and distribution networks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Extreme weather events and changes in weather patterns can also influence customer trends and shopping habits. Extended periods of unseasonably warm temperatures during the winter season or cool weather during the summer season may diminish demand for our seasonal merchandise. Heavy snowfall, hurricanes or other severe weather events where our retail stores and the retail stores of our wholesale customers are located may decrease customer traffic in those stores and reduce our sales and profitability. If severe weather events force closure of or disrupt operations at the distribution centers we use for our merchandise, we could incur higher costs and experience longer lead times to distribute our products to our retail stores, wholesale customers or e-commerce customers. If prolonged, such extreme or unseasonable weather conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe extend credit to most of our customers in the United States, and their failure to pay for products shipped to them could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe sell our products primarily to retail stores across the United States and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer's financial condition, usually without collateral. Various retailers, including some of our customers, have experienced financial difficulties, which has increased the risk of extending credit to such retailers. Even though we seek to mitigate the risks of extending credit by factoring most of our accounts receivable and obtaining letters of credit for others, if any of our customers were to experience a shortage of liquidity, the risk that the customer's outstanding payables to us would not be paid could cause us to curtail business with the customer or require us to assume more credit risk relating to the customer's accounts payable.\nOur stock price may fluctuate substantially if our operating results are inconsistent with our forecasts or those of analysts who follow us.\nThe trading price of our common stock periodically may rise or fall based on the accuracy of forecasts of our future performance. One of our primary business objectives is to maximize the long-term strength, growth and profitability of our Company, rather than to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. We believe that this longer-term goal is in our best interests and those of our stockholders. Although we have temporarily suspended offering guidance as to our quarterly and annual forecast of net sales and earnings, we recognize that it may be helpful to our stockholders and potential investors to provide such guidance in the future. In that case, we will endeavor to provide meaningful and considered guidance at the time it is provided and generally expect to provide updates to our guidance when we report our quarterly results. However, our actual results may differ from our forecasts as the guidance is based on assumptions and expectations that may or may not come to pass. As such, we assume no responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. If and when we announce actual results that differ from those that we have forecast, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. Investors who rely on these forecasts in making investment decisions with respect to our common stock do so at their own risk. We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, outside securities analysts may follow our financial results and issue reports that discuss our historical financial results and their predictions of our future performance. These analysts' predictions are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our own forecasts. Our stock price could decline if our results are below the estimates or expectations of these outside analysts.\nFOREIGN SOURCING RISKS\nDisruptions to our product delivery systems and failure to effectively manage inventory based on business trends across various distribution channels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur products are manufactured overseas and most of our products are shipped via ocean freight carriers to ports principally to our third-party distribution facilities in California and to a lesser extent in New Jersey, and via truck from Mexico to our third-party distribution facility in Texas. The trend-focused nature of the fashion industry and the rapid changes in customer preferences leave us vulnerable to the risk of inventory obsolescence. Our reliance upon ocean freight transportation for the delivery of our inventory exposes us to various inherent risks, including port congestion, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, and terrorism, any of which could result in delivery delays and inefficiencies, increase our costs and disrupt our business.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, our supply chain was disrupted by the increase in consumer demand, pandemic related outbreaks in Asia, domestic port and warehouse delays, and container shortages. In addition to these factors, global inflation has also contributed to higher freight costs. Continued disruptions of the supply chain may require us to use more expensive methods to ship our products and may result in the loss of revenue.\nAny severe and prolonged disruption to ocean freight transportation could force us to rely on alternate and more expensive transportation systems. Efficient and timely inventory deliveries and proper inventory management are important factors in our operations. Inventory shortages can adversely affect the timing of shipments to customers and diminish sales and brand loyalty. Conversely, excess inventories can result in lower gross profit due to the increased discounts and markdowns that may be necessary to reduce high inventory levels. Severe and extended delays in the delivery of our inventory or our inability to effectively manage our inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur reliance on foreign manufacturers to provide materials or produce our goods in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards could cause problems if we experience a supply chain disruption and we are unable to secure an alternative source of raw materials or end products.\nThe entire apparel industry, including our Company, continues to face supply chain challenges as a result of COVID-19 including reduced freight availability and increased costs, port disruption, manufacturing facility closures, and related labor shortages and other supply chain disruptions. We do not own or operate any foreign manufacturing facilities and, therefore, are dependent upon third parties to manufacture most of our products. During 2021, 79% of our total purchases were from China. We also have no long-term manufacturing or supply contracts with any of our suppliers or manufacturers for the production and supply of our raw materials and products, and we compete with other companies for raw materials and production. The risks inherent in reliance on foreign manufacturing include work stoppages, transportation delays, public health emergencies, social unrest, changes in local economic conditions, and political upheavals.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, a significant disruption in the supply of raw materials and products and may be unable to locate alternative suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. In addition, if we experience significant increased demand, or if we need to replace an existing supplier or manufacturer, we may be unable to locate additional supplies of raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or we may be unable to locate any supplier or manufacturer with sufficient capacity to meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner. Identifying a suitable supplier is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with its quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability, and labor and other ethical practices. Even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products, and quality control standards.\nOur supply of raw materials or manufacture of our products could be disrupted or delayed by the impact of health pandemics, including the current COVID-19 pandemic, and the related government and private sector responsive actions such as border closures, restrictions on product shipments, and travel restrictions. Delays related to supplier changes could also arise due to an increase in shipping times if new suppliers are located farther away from our markets or from other participants in our supply chain. The receipt of inventory sourced from areas impacted by COVID-19 has been slowed or disrupted and our manufacturers may also face similar challenges in receiving raw materials and fulfilling our orders. In addition, ocean freight capacity issues continue to persist worldwide due to COVID-19 as there is much greater demand for shipping and reduced capacity and equipment. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the supply of raw materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand for our products and have a material negative effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nChanges in trade policies and tariffs imposed by the United States government and the governments of other nations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur operations are dependent upon products purchased, manufactured and sold internationally. Our sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as the implementation of, or potential changes in, foreign and domestic trade policies, increases in import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of the world, political instability and terrorism. In 2018 and 2019, the United States government imposed significant tariffs and created the potential for significant additional changes in trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the United States and countries where we purchase, manufacture and sell our products. These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, including the footwear, accessories and apparel industries, and may cause us to face trade protectionism in many different regions of the world. These protectionist measures could result in increases in the cost of our products and adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nEffective September 24, 2018, the United States government imposed additional tariffs on approximately $200 billion of goods imported from China. The additional tariffs on Chinese imports were initially set at a level of 10% and were increased to 25% in May 2019. This initial round of tariffs applied to handbags and certain other accessories that we produce. In August 2019, the United States government announced a second round of tariffs set at a level of 15% on approximately $300 billion of goods imported from China, including footwear, apparel and certain other accessories that we produce. The second round of tariffs became effective on September 1, 2019, for a portion of the covered products that we produce. Tariffs for the remaining covered products that we produce were scheduled to become effective on December 15, 2019, but were suspended indefinitely as part of the phase I trade agreement between the United States and China that was signed on January 15, 2020. In addition, as of February 14, 2020, the 15% tariff that was implemented on September 1, 2019 was reduced to 7.5%. China has already imposed retaliatory tariffs on a wide range of American products in response to these tariffs. Most of the products that we sell in the United States have been manufactured in China. The negative impact in gross margin in our wholesale business in the fourth quarter of 2018 and throughout 2019 was due, in part, to the impact of the 25% tariff on handbags and certain other\naccessory categories as well as the 15% tariff on footwear, apparel, and other accessory categories. Our efforts to mitigate the impact of these tariffs may not be successful, and the continued imposition of tariffs on products that we import from China could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOn December 31, 2020, the Generalized System of Preferences (\"GSP\") expired. GSP is a trade program that provides nonreciprocal, duty-free treatment for certain U.S. imports (including handbags) from qualifying developing countries including Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, and Pakistan, among others. We currently manufacture handbags in GSP countries, primarily Cambodia. The additional tariff to be paid on such products ranges from 3.3% to 17.6%. GSP has historically been renewed, despite lapsing several times, and upon renewal has been retroactive in nature. There is a current debate in Congress as to whether reauthorize the program \u201cas is\u201d or revise GSP eligibility criteria to include environmental and labor conditions. If GSP is not renewed and our efforts to mitigate the impact of this additional tariff are not successful, the imposition of tariffs on handbags that we manufacture in impacted countries could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf our manufacturers, the manufacturers used by our licensees or our licensees themselves fail to use acceptable labor practices or to otherwise comply with local laws and other standards, our business reputation could suffer.\nOur products are manufactured by numerous independent manufacturers outside of the United States. We also have license agreements that permit our licensees to manufacture or contract to manufacture products using our trademarks. We impose, and require our licensees to impose, on these manufacturers environmental, health and safety standards for the benefit of their labor force. In addition, we require these manufacturers to comply with applicable standards for product safety. However, we do not control our independent manufacturers or licensing partners or their labor, product safety and other business practices. From time to time, our independent manufacturers may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may not require their manufacturers to comply with such standards or applicable local law. The violation of such standards and laws by one of our independent manufacturers or by one of our licensing partners, or the divergence of a manufacturer's or a licensing partner's labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States, could harm our reputation, result in a product recall or require us to curtail our relationship with and locate a replacement for such manufacturer. We could also be the focus of adverse publicity and our reputation could be damaged. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nGLOBAL BUSINESS RISKS\nOur global operations expose us to a variety of legal, regulatory, political and economic risks that may adversely impact our results of operations in certain regions.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are subject to risks associated with our operations in international markets as a result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These risks include, among other things:\n\u2022the challenge of managing broadly dispersed foreign operations;\n\u2022inflationary pressures and economic changes or volatility in foreign economies;\n\u2022the burdens of complying with the laws and regulations of both U.S. and foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022additional or increased customs duties, tariffs, taxes and other charges on imports or exports;\n\u2022political corruption or instability;\n\u2022geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife and acts of war;\n\u2022local business practices that do not conform to U.S. legal or ethical guidelines;\n\u2022anti-American sentiment in foreign countries in which we operate;\n\u2022delays in receipts of our products at our distribution centers due to labor unrest, increasing security requirements or other factors at U.S. or foreign ports;\n\u2022significant fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies;\n\u2022increased difficulty in protecting our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022restrictions on the transfer of funds between the U.S. and foreign nations; and\n\u2022natural disasters or health epidemics in areas in which our businesses, customers, suppliers and licensees are located.\nAll of these factors could disrupt our operations or limit the countries in which we sell or source our products, significantly increase the cost of operating in or obtaining materials originating from certain countries, result in decreased revenues, and materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits the payment of bribes to foreign officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business. We are also subject to anti-corruption laws of the foreign countries in which we operate. Although we have implemented policies and procedures that are designed to promote compliance with such laws, our employees, contractors and agents may take actions that violate our policies and procedures. Any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties against us and have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results.\nOur business is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe make most of our purchases in U.S. dollars. However, we source substantially all of our products overseas, and as such, the cost of these products may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies against the U.S. dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates may also affect the relative prices at which we and our foreign competitors sell products in the same market. We use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge material exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates. However, no hedging strategy can completely insulate us from foreign exchange risk. We are also exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our financial statements due to the translation of the operating results and financial position of our foreign subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that foreign currency fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. See Item 7A \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d below for additional information regarding our foreign exchange risk.\nWe may be subject to additional tax liabilities as a result of audits by various taxing authorities.\nWe are subject to the tax laws and regulations of numerous jurisdictions as a result of our international operations. These tax laws and regulations are highly complex and significant judgment and specialized expertise is required in evaluating and estimating our worldwide provision for income taxes. We are subject to audit by the taxing authorities in each jurisdiction where we conduct our business and any one of these jurisdictions may assess additional taxes against us as a result of an audit. The final determination with respect to any tax audits, and any related litigation, could be different from our estimates or from our historical tax provisions and accruals. The outcome of any audit or audit-related litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the periods for which that determination is made and may require a restatement of prior financial reports. In addition, future period earnings may be adversely impacted by litigation costs, settlement payments or interest or penalty assessments.\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY RISKS\nDisruption of our information technology systems and websites could adversely affect our financial results and our business reputation.\nWe are heavily dependent upon our information technology systems to record and process transactions and manage and operate all aspects of our business. We also have e-commerce websites for direct retail sales.\nGiven the nature of our business and the significant number of transactions in which we engage annually, it is essential that we maintain constant operation of our information technology systems and websites and that they operate effectively. We depend on our in-house information technology employees and third parties, including \u201ccloud\u201d service providers, to maintain and periodically update and upgrade our systems and websites to support the growth of our business. We also maintain an off-site server data facility that records and processes information regarding our vendors and customers and their transactions with us. Our information technology systems and websites may, from time to time, be vulnerable to damage or interruption from events such as computer viruses, security breaches, power outages and difficulties in replacing or integrating the systems of acquired businesses. Any such problems or interruptions could result in loss of valuable business data, our customers' or employees' personal information, disruption of our operations and other adverse impacts to our business and require significant expenditures by us to remediate any such failure, problem or breach. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data and an inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal risks and penalties. Although we maintain insurance coverage aimed at addressing certain of these risks, there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will be available or that the amounts of coverage will be adequate to cover a specific loss.\nOur business and reputation could be adversely affected if our computer systems or the systems of our business partners or service providers, become subject to a data security or privacy breach or other disruption from a third party.\nIn addition to our own confidential and proprietary business information, a routine part of our business includes the gathering, processing and retention of sensitive and confidential information pertaining to our customers, employees and others. We, our business partners or our service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent the rapidly evolving and complex cyber-attacks being unleashed by increasingly sophisticated hackers and data thieves.\nAs a result, our facilities and information technology systems, as well as those of our business partners and third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks and breaches, acts of vandalism, ransomware, software viruses and other similar types of malicious activities. Any actual or threatened cyber-attack may cause us to incur unanticipated costs, including costs related to the hiring of additional computer experts, business interruption, engaging third-party cyber security consultants and upgrading our information security technologies. As a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent companies, the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment has become more uncertain. Any compromise or breach of our information technology systems or those of our business partners or service providers that results in the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of a customer\u2019s or other person\u2019s private, confidential or proprietary information could result in:\n\u2022a loss of confidence in us by our customers and business partners;\n\u2022violate applicable privacy and other laws;\n\u2022expose us to litigation and significant potential liability; or\n\u2022require us to expend significant resources to remedy any such breach and redress any damages cause by such a breach.\nWe must also comply with increasingly rigorous regulatory standards for the protection of business and personal data enacted in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere. Some examples include the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") and the California Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\"). These regulations impose additional obligations on companies concerning the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. Our compliance with existing, proposed and recently enacted laws (including implementation of the privacy and process enhancements required by these regulations) and regulations can be costly. Any failure by us to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to significant legal financial and reputational harm.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS\nFailure to adequately protect our trademarks and intellectual property rights, to prevent counterfeiting of our products or to defend claims against us related to our trademarks and intellectual property rights could reduce sales and adversely affect the value of our brands.\nWe believe that our trademarks and other proprietary rights are of major significance to our success and our competitive position, and we consider some of our trademarks, such as Steve Madden\u00ae, to be integral to our business and among our most valuable assets. Accordingly, we devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks on a worldwide basis. Nevertheless, policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, expensive and time consuming. There can be no assurance that the actions we take to establish and protect our trademarks and other proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products on the basis that our products violate the trademarks or other proprietary rights of others. Moreover, no assurance can be given that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours or that we will be able to successfully resolve such conflicts. We could incur substantial costs in legal actions relating to our use of intellectual property or the use of our intellectual property by others. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Our failure to establish and protect such proprietary rights from unlawful and improper use could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nA portion of our revenue is dependent on licensing our trademarks. The actions of our licensees or the loss of a significant licensee could diminish our brand integrity and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nWe license to others the rights to produce and market certain products that are sold under our trademarks. Although we retain significant control over our licensees\u2019 products and advertising, our licensees have operational and financial control over their businesses. If the quality, image or distribution of our licensed products diminish, customer acceptance of and demand for our brands and products could decline. This could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In fiscal year 2021, approximately 70% of our net royalties were derived from our top five licensed product lines. A decrease in customer demand for any of these product lines could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, if we are unable to engage an adequate replacement for a terminated licensee or to engage such a replacement for an extended period, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nChanges in economic conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur opportunities for long-term growth and profitability are accompanied by significant challenges and risks, particularly in the near term. Specifically, our business is dependent on consumer demand for our products and the purchase of our products by consumers is largely discretionary. Consumer confidence and discretionary spending could be adversely affected in response to financial market volatility, negative financial news, increases in inflation and interest rates, conditions in the real estate and mortgage markets, declines in income or asset values, changes to fuel and other energy costs, labor and healthcare costs, food costs and other economic factors. A downturn in economic conditions leading to a reduction in consumer confidence and discretionary spending could have a negative effect on our sales and results of operations during the year ending December 31, 2022 and thereafter.\nLitigation or other legal proceedings could divert management resources and result in costs that adversely affect our operating results from quarter to quarter.\nWe are involved in various claims, litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings and governmental investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and such other proceedings and investigations, we cannot predict with accuracy the ultimate outcome of any such matters. An unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the amount of insurance coverage we maintain to address such matters may be inadequate to cover those claims. In addition, any significant litigation, investigation or proceeding, regardless of its merits, could divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. See Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d below for additional information regarding legal proceedings in which we are involved.\nChanges in tax laws could have an adverse effect upon our financial results.\nWe are subject to income taxation in various jurisdictions in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction are subject to significant changes. Legislation or other changes in the tax laws of the jurisdictions where we do business could increase our tax liability and adversely affect our after-tax profitability. Adjustments to the incremental provisional tax expense may be made in future periods as actual amounts may differ due to, among other factors, a change in interpretation of the U.S. tax code and related tax accounting guidance, changes in assumptions made in developing these estimates, regulatory guidance that may be issued with respect to the applicable revisions to the U.S. tax code and state tax implications.\nOther jurisdictions are contemplating changes or have unpredictable enforcement activity. Increases in applicable tax rates, implementation of new taxes, changes in applicable tax laws and interpretations of these tax laws and actions by tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate could reduce our after-tax income and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSEC rules relating to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d require us to incur additional expenses and could adversely affect our business.\nThe SEC has promulgated final rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requiring the disclosure of the use of tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d included in products either manufactured by public companies or as to which public companies have contracted for the manufacture. These rules, adopted in an effort to prevent inadvertent support of armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and certain adjoining countries (collectively, the \u201cDRC\u201d), require companies to investigate their supply chains to determine whether these minerals are present in their products and, if so, from where the minerals originate. The rules also require disclosure and annual reporting as to whether or not conflict minerals, if used in the manufacture of the products offered, originate from the DRC. We currently require our manufacturers to comply with policies addressing legal and ethical concerns relating to labor, employment, political and social matters, including restrictions on the use of conflict minerals. Violation of these policies by our manufacturers could harm our reputation, disrupt our supply chain or increase our cost of goods sold. Additionally, violation of any of these policies by our manufacturers could cause us to face disqualification as a supplier for our customers and suffer reputational challenges. Due to the complexity of our supply chain, compliance with the rules requires significant efforts from a cross-operational team diverts the attention of our management and personnel and could require us to hire additional staff. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our sales, net earnings, business and financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting could materially adversely affect us.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to include in our annual reports on Form 10-K an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In particular, we must perform\nsystem and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our compliance with Section 404 may require us to incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. Our failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in a determination by our auditors that a material weakness or significant deficiency exists in our internal controls. Such a determination could result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and could require us to restate our quarterly or annual financial statements. These factors could, in turn, negatively affect the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 80034, "SIC": 3140, "TIC": "SHOO"}
