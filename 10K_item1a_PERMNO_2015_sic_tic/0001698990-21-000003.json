{"cik": "1698990", "company": "Magnolia Oil & Gas Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe nature of Magnolia\u2019s business activities subjects the Company to certain hazards and risks. The following risks and uncertainties, together with other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be carefully considered by current and future investors in the Company\u2019s securities. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones Magnolia faces. Additional risks and uncertainties presently unknown to Magnolia, or currently deemed immaterial, also may impair the Company\u2019s business operations. The occurrence of one or more of these risks or uncertainties could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, its financial condition, and the results of Magnolia\u2019s operations, which in turn could negatively impact the value of the Company\u2019s securities.\nRisks Related to the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic\nCOVID-19 and other pandemic outbreaks could negatively impact Magnolia\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company may face additional risks related to the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, which has been declared a \u201cpandemic\u201d by the World Health Organization. International, federal, state, and local public health and governmental authorities have taken extraordinary and wide-ranging actions to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 in regions across the United States and the world, including mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations. To the extent COVID-19 continues or worsens, governments may impose additional similar restrictions. The full impact of COVID-19 is unknown and rapidly evolving. The outbreak and any preventative or protective actions that the Company or its customers may take in response to this virus may result in a period of disruption, including the Company\u2019s financial reporting capabilities, its operations generally, and could potentially impact the Company\u2019s customers, distribution partners, and third parties. In addition, many of the Company\u2019s non-operational employees worked remotely, which increased the risk of security breaches or other cyber-incidents or attacks, loss of data, fraud, and other disruptions. Any resulting impacts from the outbreak cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, and may materially affect the business and the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The extent and duration of such impacts will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. On October 1, 2020, the substantial majority of Magnolia\u2019s employees returned to the office.\nThe marketability of Company production is dependent upon market demand, vehicles, transportation and storage facilities, and other facilities, most of which the Company does not control. If these vehicles or facilities are unavailable, or if the Company is unable to access such vehicles or facilities on commercially reasonable terms, operations could be interrupted, production could be curtailed or shut in, and revenues could be reduced.\nThe marketing of oil, natural gas, and NGL production depends in large part on the availability, proximity, and capacity of trucks, pipelines, and storage facilities, natural gas gathering systems, and other transportation, processing, and refining facilities, as well as the existence of adequate markets. If there is a resurgence of the outbreak across the United States and other locations across the world and the related social distancing guidelines, travel restrictions, and stay-at-home orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic and such resurgence reduces demand for oil and natural gas, available storage and transportation capacity for the Company\u2019s production may be limited or unavailable in the future. If there is insufficient capacity, if the capacity is unavailable to the Company, or if the capacity is unavailable on commercially reasonable terms, the prices Magnolia receives for its production could be significantly depressed.\nAs a result of continued or further storage and/or market shortages, the Company could be forced to temporarily shut in some or all of its production or delay or discontinue drilling plans and commercial production following a discovery of hydrocarbons while the Company constructs or purchases its own facilities or system. If the Company is forced to shut in production, it may incur greater costs to bring the associated production back online. Potential cost increases associated with bringing wells back online may be significant enough that such wells may become non-economic at low commodity price levels, which may lead to decreases in proved reserve estimates and potential impairments and associated charges to earnings. If the Company is able to bring wells back online, there is no assurance that such wells will be as productive following recommencement as they were prior to being shut in. For example, in the second quarter of 2020, the Company temporarily shut in some low producing wells due to depressed commodity prices. Additionally, some of the Company\u2019s non-operated wells were shut in. Many of the wells have returned to production and there was not a significant impact on net production, however, should sustained periods of lower oil and natural gas prices return, the Company may further shut in wells or curtail production.\nRisks Related to Magnolia\u2019s Overall Business Operations\nOil, natural gas, and NGL prices are volatile. A sustained period of low oil, natural gas, and NGL prices could adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and ability to meet its expenditure obligations and financial commitments.\nThe prices Magnolia receives for its oil, natural gas, and NGL production will heavily influence its revenue, profitability, access to capital, future rate of growth, and the carrying value of its properties. Oil, natural gas, and NGLs are commodities, and their prices may fluctuate widely in response to market uncertainty and to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil, natural gas, and NGLs. Historically, oil, natural gas, and NGL prices have been volatile. The prices Magnolia receives for its production and the levels of Magnolia\u2019s production, depend on numerous factors beyond Magnolia\u2019s control, which include the following:\n\u2022the length, scope, and severity of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including the effects of related public health concerns and the impact of continued actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic and its impact on commodity prices, supply and demand considerations, and storage capacity;\n\u2022U.S. federal, state, local, and non-U.S. governmental regulation and taxes;\n\u2022worldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil, natural gas, and NGLs;\n\u2022the price and quantity of foreign imports of oil, natural gas, and NGLs;\n\u2022political and economic conditions in or affecting other producing regions or countries, including the Middle East, Africa, South America, and Russia;\n\u2022actions of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, its members, and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u2022the level of global exploration, development, and production;\n\u2022the level of global inventories;\n\u2022prevailing prices on local price indexes in the areas in which Magnolia operates;\n\u2022the proximity, capacity, cost, and availability of gathering and transportation facilities;\n\u2022localized and global supply, demand fundamentals, and transportation availability; the cost of exploring for, developing, producing, and transporting reserves;\n\u2022weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022expectations about future commodity prices; and\n\u2022events that impact global market demand.\nLower commodity prices may reduce Magnolia\u2019s cash flow and borrowing ability. If Magnolia is unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, its ability to develop future reserves could be adversely affected. Also, using lower prices in estimating proved reserves may result in a reduction in proved reserves volumes due to economic limits. In addition, sustained periods with lower oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect drilling economics and Magnolia\u2019s ability to raise capital, which may require it to re-evaluate and postpone or eliminate its development program, and result in the reduction of some proved undeveloped reserves and related standardized measure. If Magnolia is required to curtail its drilling program, Magnolia may be unable to hold leases that are scheduled to expire, which may further reduce reserves. As a result, a substantial or extended decline in commodity prices may materially and adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nPart of Magnolia\u2019s business strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which involve risks and uncertainties in their application.\nMagnolia\u2019s operations involve utilizing some of the latest drilling and completion (\u201cD&C\u201d) techniques. The difficulties Magnolia faces drilling horizontal wells include landing its wellbore in the desired drilling zone, staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation, running its casing the entire length of the wellbore, and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore.\nThe difficulties that Magnolia faces while completing its wells include the ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, the ability to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations, and the ability to successfully clean out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage.\nUse of new technologies may not prove successful and could result in significant cost overruns or delays or reductions in production, and, in extreme cases, the abandonment of a well. In addition, certain of the new techniques may cause irregularities or interruptions in production due to offset wells being shut in and the time required to drill and complete multiple wells before any such\nwells begin producing. Furthermore, the results of drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer and emerging formations and areas have limited or no production history and, consequently, Magnolia may be more limited in assessing future drilling results in these areas. If its drilling results are less than anticipated, the return on investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as anticipated, and Magnolia could incur material write-downs of unevaluated properties, and the value of undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nFor example, potential complications associated with the new D&C techniques that Magnolia utilizes may cause Magnolia to be unable to develop its assets in line with current expectations and projections. Further, Magnolia\u2019s recent well results may not be indicative of its future well results.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nMagnolia\u2019s future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of its development, production, and acquisition activities, which are subject to numerous risks beyond its control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil and natural gas production.\nMagnolia\u2019s decisions to develop or purchase prospects or properties will depend, in part, on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analysis, production data, and engineering studies, which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. For a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes, see \u201cCrude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves are estimates, and actual recoveries may vary significantly.\u201d In addition, the cost of drilling, completing, and operating wells is often uncertain.\nFurther, many factors may curtail, delay, or cancel scheduled drilling projects, including:\n\u2022delays imposed by, or resulting from, permitting activities, compliance with regulatory requirements, including limitations on wastewater disposal, emission of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d), and hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022pressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022sustained periods of low oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel or in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing activities;\n\u2022equipment failures, accidents, or other unexpected operational events;\n\u2022lack of available gathering facilities or delays in construction of gathering facilities;\n\u2022lack of available capacity on interconnecting transmission pipelines;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022issues related to compliance with environmental regulations;\n\u2022environmental or safety hazards, such as oil and natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and tank ruptures, and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases, or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;\n\u2022limited availability of financing on acceptable terms;\n\u2022title issues;\n\u2022other market limitations in Magnolia\u2019s industry; and\n\u2022the length, scope, and severity of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including the effects of related public health concerns and the impact of continued actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic and its impact on commodity prices, supply and demand considerations, and storage capacity.\nCrude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves are estimates, and actual recoveries may vary significantly.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves. In order to prepare the reserve estimates, Magnolia must project production rates and timing of development expenditures. The Company must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production, and engineering data. The extent, quality, and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, and availability of funds. Magnolia cannot assure you that its management team\u2019s assumptions with respect to projected production and/or the timing of development expenditures will not materially change in subsequent periods. Magnolia\u2019s management team and board may determine to secure and deploy development capital at a faster or slower pace than currently assumed.\nActual future production, oil prices, natural gas prices, NGL prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary from Magnolia\u2019s estimates. For instance, initial production rates reported by Magnolia or other operators may not be indicative of future or long-term production rates, recovery efficiencies may be worse than expected, and production declines may be greater than anticipated and may be more rapid and irregular when compared to initial production rates. In addition, estimates of proved reserves may be adjusted to reflect additional production history, results of development activities, current commodity prices, and other existing factors. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves. Moreover, there can be no assurance that reserves will ultimately be produced or that proved undeveloped reserves will be developed within the periods anticipated.\nActual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate. If spot prices are below such calculated amounts, using more recent prices in estimating proved reserves may result in a reduction in proved reserve volumes due to economic limits.\nThe standardized measure of estimated reserves may not be an accurate estimate of the current fair value of estimated oil and natural gas reserves.\nThe standardized measure is a reporting convention that provides a common basis for comparing oil and gas companies subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The standardized measure requires historical 12-month pricing as required by the SEC as well as operating and development costs prevailing as of the date of computation. Consequently, it may not reflect the prices ordinarily received or that will be received for oil and natural gas production because of varying market conditions, and it also may not reflect the actual costs that will be required to produce or develop the oil and natural gas properties. In addition, the sellers in the Business Combination were generally not subject to U.S. federal, state, or local income taxes other than certain state franchise taxes. Magnolia is subject to U.S. federal, state, and local income taxes. As a result, estimates included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K of future net cash flow may be materially different from the future net cash flows that are ultimately received. Therefore, the standardized measure of estimated reserves included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be construed as accurate estimates of the current fair value of such proved reserves.\nProperties Magnolia has acquired or will acquire may not produce as projected, and Magnolia may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with such properties, or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities.\nAcquiring oil and natural gas properties requires Magnolia to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics, including recoverable reserves, future oil and natural gas prices and their applicable differentials, development and operating costs, and potential liabilities, including environmental liabilities. In connection with these assessments, Magnolia performs a review of the subject properties that it believes to be generally consistent with industry practices. Such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain. For these reasons, the properties Magnolia has acquired or will acquire may not produce as expected. In connection with the assessments, Magnolia performs a review of the subject properties, but such a review may not reveal all existing or potential problems. In the course of due diligence, Magnolia may not review every well, pipeline, or associated facility. Magnolia cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, when a review is performed. Magnolia may be unable to obtain or successfully enforce contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities created prior to Magnolia\u2019s purchase of the property. Magnolia may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with its expectations. Additionally, the success of future acquisitions will depend on Magnolia\u2019s ability to integrate effectively the then-acquired business into its then-existing operations. The process of integrating acquired assets may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of managerial and financial resources. Magnolia\u2019s failure to achieve consolidation savings, to incorporate the additionally acquired assets into its then-existing operations successfully, or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties, or the failure to acquire future assets at all, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nMagnolia is not the operator on all of its acreage or drilling locations, and, therefore, is not able to control the timing of exploration or development efforts, associated costs, or the rate of production of any non-operated assets and could be liable for certain financial obligations of the operators or any of its contractors to the extent such operator or contractor is unable to satisfy such obligations.\nMagnolia conducts many of its exploration and production operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which the Company may not control decisions, either because the Company does not have a controlling interest or is not an operator under the agreement. There is risk that these parties may at any time have economic, business, or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with Magnolia\u2019s, and therefore decisions may be made that are not what the Company believes are in its best interest. Moreover, parties to these agreements may be unable or unwilling to meet their economic or other obligations, and Magnolia may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. In either case, the value of Magnolia\u2019s investment may be adversely affected.\nMagnolia\u2019s producing properties are predominantly located in South Texas, making Magnolia vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a limited geographic area.\nSubstantially all of Magnolia\u2019s producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Karnes County portion of the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and the Giddings area of the Austin Chalk. As a result, Magnolia may be disproportionately exposed to various factors, including, among others: (i) the impact of regional supply and demand factors, (ii) delays or interruptions of production from wells in such areas caused by governmental regulation, (iii) processing or transportation capacity constraints, (iv) market limitations, (v) availability of equipment and personnel, (vi) water shortages or other drought related conditions, or (vii) interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas, or NGLs. The concentration of Magnolia\u2019s assets in a limited geographic area also increases its exposure to changes in local laws and regulations, certain lease stipulations designed to protect wildlife and unexpected events that may occur in the regions such as natural disasters, seismic events, industrial accidents, or labor difficulties. Any one of these factors has the potential to cause producing wells to be shut-in, delay operations, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs, and prevent development of lease inventory before expirations. Any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on Magnolia\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nMagnolia may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which it invests.\nThe existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. While Magnolia typically obtains title opinions prior to commencing drilling operations on a lease or in a unit, the failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled, in which case Magnolia may lose the lease and the right to produce all or a portion of the minerals under the property. Additionally, if an examination of the title history of a property reveals that an oil or natural gas lease or other developed right has been purchased in error from a person who is not the owner of the mineral interest desired, Magnolia\u2019s interest would substantially decline in value. In such cases, the amount paid for such oil or natural gas lease or leases would be lost.\nThe development of proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than anticipated. Therefore, proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nAs of December 31, 2020, Magnolia\u2019s assets contained 26.5 MMboe of proved undeveloped reserves consisting of 11.2 MMBbls of oil, 42.1 Bcf of natural gas, and 8.3 MMBbls of NGLs. Development of these proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than anticipated. Magnolia\u2019s ability to fund these expenditures is subject to a number of risks. Magnolia may be unable to obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in its ability to access or grow production and reserves. Delays in the development of reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves, or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the value of the proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves, and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could cause Magnolia to have to reclassify proved undeveloped reserves as unproved reserves. Furthermore, there is no certainty that Magnolia will be able to convert proved undeveloped reserves to developed reserves, or that undeveloped reserves will be economically viable or technically feasible to produce.\nCertain factors could require Magnolia to write-down the carrying values of its properties, including commodity prices decreasing to a level such that future undiscounted cash flows from its properties are less than their carrying value.\nAccounting rules require that Magnolia periodically review the carrying value of its properties for possible impairment. Based on prevailing commodity prices, specific market factors, circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics, and other factors, Magnolia may be required to write-down the carrying value of its properties. A write-down constitutes a non-cash impairment charge to earnings. Further declines in commodity prices may adversely affect proved reserve values, which would likely result in a proved property impairment of Magnolia\u2019s properties, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken. During the first quarter of 2020, Magnolia recorded impairments of $1.9 billion related to proved and unproved properties as a result of a sharp decline in commodity prices. Proved property impairment of $1.4 billion is included in \u201cImpairment of oil and natural gas properties\u201d and unproved property impairment of $0.6 billion is included in \u201cExploration expense\u201d on the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations. Magnolia could experience additional material write-downs as a result of lower commodity prices or other factors, including low production results or high lease operating expenses, capital expenditures, or transportation fees.\nUnless Magnolia replaces its reserves with new reserves and develops those new reserves, its reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect future cash flows and results of operations.\nProducing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Unless Magnolia conducts successful ongoing exploration and development activities or continually acquires properties containing proved reserves, proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Magnolia\u2019s\nfuture reserves and production, and therefore future cash flow and results of operations, are highly dependent on Magnolia\u2019s success in efficiently developing current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. Magnolia may not be able to develop, find, or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace future production. If Magnolia is unable to replace such production, the value of its reserves will decrease, and its business, financial condition, and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nProperties that Magnolia decides to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities.\nProperties that Magnolia decides to drill that do not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities will adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable. The use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable Magnolia to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities. Magnolia cannot ensure that the analogies drawn from available data from other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields will be applicable to its drilling prospects. Further, Magnolia\u2019s drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, title issues, pressure or lost circulation in formations, equipment failures or accidents, adverse weather conditions, compliance with environmental and other governmental or contractual requirements, and increases in the cost of, and shortages or delays in the availability of, electricity, supplies, materials, drilling or workover rigs, equipment, and services.\nMagnolia depends upon a small number of significant purchasers for the sale of most of its oil, natural gas, and NGL production. The loss of one or more of such purchasers could, among other factors, limit Magnolia\u2019s access to suitable markets for the oil, natural gas, and NGLs it produces.\nMagnolia normally sells its production to a relatively small number of customers, as is customary in the oil and natural gas business. In 2020, there were two purchasers who accounted for an aggregate 56.6% of the total revenue attributable to Magnolia\u2019s assets. The loss of any significant purchaser could adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s revenues in the short term. Magnolia expects to depend upon these or other significant purchasers for the sale of most of its oil and natural gas production. Magnolia cannot ensure that it will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for its future oil and natural gas production.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and oilfield services could adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s ability to execute its development plans within its budget and on a timely basis.\nThe demand for drilling rigs, pipe, and other equipment and supplies, as well as for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers, and other professionals in the oil and gas industry, can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil, natural gas, and NGL prices, causing periodic shortages of supplies and needed personnel. Magnolia\u2019s operations are concentrated in areas in which oilfield activity levels have increased rapidly, and as a result, demand for such drilling rigs, equipment, and personnel, as well as access to transportation, processing, and refining facilities in these areas, have increased, as have the costs for those items. To the extent that commodity prices improve in the future, the demand for and prices of these goods and services are likely to increase, and Magnolia could encounter delays in securing, or an inability to secure, the personnel, equipment, power, services, resources, and facilities access necessary for it to resume or increase Magnolia\u2019s development activities, which could result in production volumes being below its forecasted volumes. In addition, any such negative effect on production volumes, or significant increases in costs, could have a material adverse effect on cash flow and profitability. Furthermore, if it is unable to secure a sufficient number of drilling rigs at reasonable costs, Magnolia may not be able to drill all of its acreage before its leases expire.\nCompetition in the oil and gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for Magnolia to acquire properties, market oil or natural gas, and secure trained personnel.\nMagnolia\u2019s ability to acquire additional prospects to complement or expand the Company\u2019s current business and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on its ability to evaluate and select suitable properties for acquisitions and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas, and securing trained personnel. However, there is no guarantee that Magnolia will be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities. In the event it is able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, Magnolia may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms. Competition for capital available for investment in the oil and gas industry, specifically for acquisitions, may also increase the cost of, or cause Magnolia to refrain from, completing acquisitions. Many other oil and gas companies possess and employ greater financial, technical, and personnel resources than Magnolia. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for, and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than Magnolia\u2019s financial or personnel resources permit. Magnolia may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel, and raising additional\ncapital, which could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nThe loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect operations.\nMagnolia depends on the services of its senior management and technical personnel. Magnolia does not maintain, nor does Magnolia plan to obtain, any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals. The loss of the services of its senior management could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMagnolia may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in its industry.\nThe oil and gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancement and the introduction of new products and services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, Magnolia may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or may be forced by competitive pressures to implement those new technologies at substantial cost. In addition, other oil and gas companies may have greater financial, technical, and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and that may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before Magnolia can. Magnolia may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies it expects to use were to become obsolete, Magnolia\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nMagnolia\u2019s business could be adversely affected by security threats, including cyber security threats, and related disruptions.\nMagnolia relies heavily on its information systems, and the availability and integrity of these systems is essential to conducting Magnolia\u2019s business and operations. Technical system flaws, power loss, cyber security risks, including cyber or phishing-attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees or others with authorized access, ransomware, and other cyber security issues could compromise Magnolia\u2019s computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to the Company\u2019s business operations or the access, disclosure, or loss of Company data and proprietary information. Additionally, as a producer of natural gas and oil, Magnolia faces various security threats that could render its information or systems unusable, and threats to the security of its facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as gathering and processing and other facilities, refineries and pipelines. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of, or damage to, sensitive information, facilities, infrastructure, and systems essential to its business and operations, as well as data corruption, communication interruptions, or other disruptions to its operations, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nMagnolia\u2019s implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate such security threats and to increase security for its information, systems, facilities, and infrastructure may result in increased costs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring.\nPotential future legislation may generally affect the taxation of natural gas and oil exploration and development companies and may adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s future cash flows and results of operations.\nIn past years, federal legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to tax laws, including to certain key U.S. federal and state income tax provisions currently available to natural gas and oil exploration and development companies. For example, the Biden Administration has set forth several tax proposals that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws. Such proposals include, but are not limited to, (i) an increase in the U.S. income tax rate applicable to corporations and (ii) the elimination of tax subsidies for fossil fuels. Congress could consider some or all of these proposals in connection with tax reform to be undertaken by the Biden Administration. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals and other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s future cash flows and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Environmental and Political Conditions\nMagnolia\u2019s operations are subject to environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may expose the Company to significant costs and liabilities.\nMagnolia\u2019s operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, health and safety aspects of the Company\u2019s operations or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to Magnolia\u2019s operations, including the acquisition of a permit or other approval before conducting regulated activities; the restriction of types, quantities, and\nconcentration of materials that can be released into the environment; the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, and other protected areas; the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from the Company\u2019s operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties.\nCertain environmental laws impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been stored or released. Magnolia may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by the Company or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by the Companies.\nMagnolia may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of operations. Additionally, Magnolia may not be insured for, or insurance may be inadequate to protect Magnolia against, these risks.\nMagnolia is not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nMagnolia\u2019s development activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable releases of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas, or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater, air, and shoreline contamination, or the presence of endangered or threatened species; abnormally pressured formations; mechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse; fires, explosions, and ruptures of pipelines; personal injuries and death; natural disasters; and terrorist attacks targeting oil and natural gas related facilities and infrastructure.\nEvents that could adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s ability to conduct operations or result in substantial loss as a result of claims include injury or loss of life, damage to and destruction of property, natural resources, and equipment, pollution and other environmental damage, regulatory investigations and penalties, and repair and remediation costs.\nMagnolia may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if it believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCertain of Magnolia\u2019s properties are subject to land use restrictions, which could limit the manner in which Magnolia conducts business.\nCertain of Magnolia\u2019s properties are subject to land use restrictions, including city ordinances, which could limit the manner in which Magnolia conducts business. Such restrictions could affect, among other things, access to and the permissible uses of facilities as well as the manner in which Magnolia produces oil and natural gas and may restrict or prohibit drilling in general. The costs incurred to comply with such restrictions may be significant in nature, and Magnolia may experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of development activities and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling of wells.\nMagnolia\u2019s operations are subject to a series of risks arising from climate change.\nThe threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention globally. In the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. However, President Biden has highlighted addressing climate change as a priority of his administration, and federal regulators, state and local governments, and private parties have taken (or announced that they plan to take) actions that have or may have a significant influence on the Company\u2019s operations. For example, following the determination that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and welfare, the EPA has adopted regulations to regulate GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from certain sources, and (together with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States, among other things. The regulation of methane from oil and gas facilities has been subject to uncertainty in recent years. In September 2020, the Trump Administration revised prior regulations to rescind certain methane standards and remove the transmission and storage segments from the source category for certain regulations. However, on January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order calling for the suspension, revision, or rescission of the September 2020 rule and the reinstatement or issuance of methane emissions standards for new, modified, and existing oil and gas facilities.\nSeparately, a number of states have developed programs that are aimed at reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, or encouraging the use of renewable energy or alternative low-carbon fuels. Cap and trade programs typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. In\naddition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues. For example, in April 2016, the United States signed the Paris Agreement, which includes nonbinding pledges to limit or reduce future emissions. Although the United States had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, President Biden has signed executive orders recommitting the United States to the agreement and calling for the federal government to begin formulating the United States\u2019 nationally determined emissions reduction goals under the agreement. However, the impacts of these orders and the terms of any legislation or regulation to implement the United States\u2019 commitment under the Paris Agreement remain unclear at this time.\nConcern over climate change has also resulted in political risks in the United States, including climate-related pledges by certain candidates now in public office. On January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that commits to substantial action on climate change, calling for, among other things, the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry, a suspension on the issuance of new authorizations for oil and gas activities on federal lands, and an increased emphasis on climate-related risk across governmental agencies and economic sectors. Other actions that could be pursued by the Biden Administration may include the imposition of more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of LNG export facilities, as well as more restrictive GHG emissions limitations for oil and gas facilities. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities and other local governments have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and gas companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to climate change or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but failed to adequately disclose such impacts to their investors or customers.\nAdditionally, Magnolia\u2019s access to capital may be impacted by climate-related policies. Financial institutions may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investment into non-fossil fuel related sectors. There is also a risk that financial institutions may be required to adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the fossil fuel sector. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities. Additionally, activist shareholders have introduced proposals that may seek to force companies to adopt aggressive emission reduction targets or to shift away from more carbon-intensive industries. Separately, activists may also pursue other means of curtailing oil and natural gas operations, such as through litigation. The Company continually monitors the global climate change agenda initiatives, including stakeholder concerns, and responds accordingly based on its assessment of such initiatives on its business.\nSeparately, many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG in the earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods, among other climatic phenomena. If any of those effects were to occur in areas where Magnolia\u2019s facilities are located, they could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s assets and operations.\nFederal, state, and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs, additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells, and adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s production.\nThe hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, proppants, and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. It is typically done at substantial depths in formations with low permeability. Magnolia routinely uses fracturing techniques in the U.S. and other regions to expand the available space for natural gas and oil to migrate toward the wellbore. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but certain federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process, including air emissions, fracturing fluid constituents, and wastewater disposal, among others.\nFrom time to time the U.S. Congress has considered proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the U.S. Safe Drinking Water Act. While, to date, those proposals have not been enacted, such proposal may be considered again in the future. Several states have already enacted or are otherwise considering legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing practices through more stringent permitting, fluid disclosure, and well construction requirements on hydraulic-fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. Hydraulic fracturing of wells and subsurface water disposal via injection wells are also under public and governmental scrutiny due to potential environmental and physical impacts, including possible contamination of groundwater and drinking water and possible links to seismic events. In addition, some municipalities have significantly limited or prohibited drilling activities and/or hydraulic fracturing or are considering doing so. Although it is not possible at this time to predict the final outcome of the legislation regarding hydraulic fracturing, any new federal, state, or local restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which the Company conducts business could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions in the U.S.\nRisks Related to Financing and Liquidity\nMagnolia may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy debt obligations, which may not be successful.\nMagnolia\u2019s ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance its indebtedness obligations, including the RBL Facility and the 6.0% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201c2026 Senior Notes\u201d), depends on Magnolia\u2019s financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions, industry cycles and certain financial, business and other factors affecting Magnolia\u2019s operations, many of which are beyond Magnolia\u2019s control. Magnolia may not be able to maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit Magnolia to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on its indebtedness. Failure to make required payments on its indebtedness will result in an event of default under the agreement governing the applicable indebtedness, entitling the requisite lenders of such indebtedness to accelerate the payment of obligations thereunder and to exercise other remedies, including in respect of collateral (if any) securing such indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $400.0 million of principal debt related to the 2026 Senior Notes outstanding and no outstanding borrowings related to the RBL Facility and $450.0 million of borrowing capacity of the RBL Facility.\nIf Magnolia\u2019s cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund debt service obligations, Magnolia may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance existing indebtedness. Magnolia\u2019s ability to restructure or refinance indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and its financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of indebtedness may be at higher interest rates and may require Magnolia to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations. The terms of Magnolia\u2019s existing or future debt instruments may restrict it from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely harm its ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of sufficient cash flows and capital resources, Magnolia could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet debt service and other obligations. The RBL Facility and the indenture governing the 2026 Senior Notes limit Magnolia\u2019s ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from such dispositions. Magnolia may not be able to consummate those dispositions, and the proceeds of any such disposition may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit Magnolia to meet scheduled debt service obligations.\nRestrictions in Magnolia\u2019s existing and future debt agreements could limit Magnolia\u2019s growth and ability to engage in certain activities.\nMagnolia\u2019s ability to meet its expenses and debt obligations and comply with the covenants and restrictions contained therein will depend on its future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, industry, regulatory, and other factors, many of which are beyond Magnolia\u2019s control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, Magnolia\u2019s ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. For example, Magnolia\u2019s RBL Facility requires Magnolia to maintain quarterly compliance with a leverage and current ratio and the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the absence of defaults and events of default thereunder, to borrow money. Magnolia\u2019s debt agreements also restrict the payment of dividends and distributions by certain of its subsidiaries to it, which could affect its access to cash. In addition, Magnolia\u2019s ability to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the agreements governing its indebtedness will be affected by the levels of cash flow from operations, future events, and other circumstances beyond Magnolia\u2019s control. Breach of these covenants or restrictions will result in a default under Magnolia\u2019s debt agreements, which if not cured or waived within the applicable grace period (if any), would permit the acceleration of all indebtedness outstanding thereunder by the requisite holders of such indebtedness. Upon acceleration, the indebtedness would become immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and any commitments of a lender to make further loans to Magnolia may terminate. Even if new financing were then available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to Magnolia. In addition to accelerating the indebtedness, the requisite group of affected lenders may exercise remedies upon the incurrence of an event of default, including through foreclosure, in respect of the collateral securing any such secured financing arrangements. Moreover, any subsequent replacement of Magnolia\u2019s financing arrangements may require it to comply with more restrictive covenants, which could further restrict business operations.\nAny significant reduction in Magnolia\u2019s borrowing base under the RBL Facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact Magnolia\u2019s ability to fund its operations.\nThe RBL Facility limits the amounts Magnolia can borrow up to a borrowing base amount, which the lenders determine, in good faith, in accordance with their respective usual and customary oil and natural gas lending criteria, based upon the loan value of the proved oil and natural gas reserves located within the geographic boundaries of the United States included in the most recent reserve report provided to the lenders. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $450.0 million of borrowing base capacity of the RBL Facility and no borrowings.\nThe RBL Facility requires periodic borrowing base redeterminations based on reserve reports. Additionally, the borrowing base is subject to unscheduled reductions due to certain issuances of new junior lien indebtedness, unsecured indebtedness or subordinated indebtedness, certain sales or acquisitions of borrowing base properties, or early monetizations or terminations of certain hedge or swap positions. An unscheduled redetermination may also be requested by the requisite lenders under the RBL Facility, once within a 12-month period, or by Magnolia, twice within a 12-month period. A reduced borrowing base could render Magnolia unable to access adequate funding under the RBL Facility. The RBL Facility also includes \u201canti-cash hoarding\u201d provisions, which limit Magnolia Operating\u2019s ability to maintain a consolidated cash balance in excess of $65 million any time there are borrowings outstanding. Additionally, if the aggregate amount outstanding under the RBL Facility exceeds the borrowing base at any time, Magnolia would be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base or to provide mortgages on additional borrowing base properties to eliminate such excess. As a result of a mandatory prepayment and/or reduced access to funds under the RBL Facility, Magnolia may be unable to implement its drilling and development plan, make acquisitions, or otherwise carry out business plans, which would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nMagnolia\u2019s development projects and acquisitions require substantial capital expenditures. Magnolia may be unable to obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in its ability to access or grow production and reserves.\nThe oil and gas industry is capital-intensive. Magnolia makes, and expects to continue to make, substantial capital expenditures related to development and acquisition projects. Magnolia has funded, and expects to continue to fund, its capital budget with cash generated by operations and potentially through borrowings under Magnolia\u2019s secured reserve-based revolving credit facility (the \u201cRBL Facility\u201d). However, Magnolia\u2019s financing needs may require it to alter or increase its capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities or the sale of assets. The issuance of additional indebtedness would require that an additional portion of cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on its indebtedness, thereby further reducing its ability to use cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. The issuance of additional equity securities would be dilutive to existing stockholders. The actual amount and timing of future capital expenditures may differ materially from estimates as a result of, among other things: commodity prices; actual drilling results; the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment; and regulatory, technological, and competitive developments. A reduction in commodity prices from current levels may result in a decrease in actual capital expenditures, which would negatively impact Magnolia\u2019s ability to grow production.\nMagnolia\u2019s cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022the prices at which Magnolia\u2019s production is sold;\n\u2022proved reserves;\n\u2022the amount of hydrocarbons Magnolia is able to produce from its wells;\n\u2022Magnolia\u2019s ability to acquire, locate, and produce new reserves;\n\u2022the amount of Magnolia\u2019s operating expenses;\n\u2022Magnolia\u2019s ability to borrow under the RBL Facility;\n\u2022restrictions in the instruments governing Magnolia\u2019s debt, and Magnolia\u2019s ability to incur additional indebtedness; and\n\u2022Magnolia\u2019s ability to access the capital markets.\nIf Magnolia\u2019s revenues or the borrowing base under the RBL Facility decrease as a result of lower oil, natural gas, and NGL prices, operational difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, Magnolia may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain operations at current levels. If additional capital is needed, Magnolia may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to it, if at all. If cash flow generated by Magnolia\u2019s operations or available borrowings under the RBL Facility are insufficient to meet its capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of the development of Magnolia\u2019s properties, which in turn could lead to a decline in reserves and production and could materially and adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. If Magnolia incurs additional indebtedness, the operational risks that Magnolia faces could intensify, and Magnolia may be unable to service its existing debt service obligations.\nA negative shift in investor or shareholder sentiment of the oil and gas industry could adversely affect Magnolia\u2019s business and ability to raise debt and equity capital.\nCertain segments of the investor community have developed negative sentiment towards investing in the oil and gas industry. Recent equity returns in the sector versus other industry sectors have led to lower oil and natural gas representation in certain key equity market indices. In addition, some investors, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension funds, university endowments, and family foundations, have stated policies to disinvest in the oil and gas sector based on their social and environmental considerations. Certain other stakeholders have also pressured commercial and investment banks to reduce or stop financing oil and natural gas and related infrastructure projects.\nIn addition, shareholder activism has been recently increasing in the oil and gas industry, and shareholders may attempt to effect changes to Magnolia\u2019s business or governance, whether by shareholder proposals, public campaigns, proxy solicitations, or otherwise. Such actions could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business by distracting management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities, require the Company to incur increased costs, and/or result in reputational harm.\nSuch developments, including environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution, could result in downward pressure on the stock prices of oil and gas companies, including Magnolia\u2019s. This may also potentially result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential development projects, impacting the Company\u2019s future financial results.\nRisks Related to Magnolia\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Capital Structure\nMagnolia is a holding company. Magnolia\u2019s sole material asset is its equity interest in Magnolia LLC, and Magnolia is accordingly dependent upon distributions from Magnolia LLC to pay taxes and cover its corporate and other overhead expenses.\nMagnolia is a holding company and has no material assets other than its equity interest in Magnolia LLC. Magnolia has no independent means of generating revenue. To the extent Magnolia LLC has available cash, Magnolia intends to cause Magnolia LLC to make (i) generally pro rata distributions to its unitholders, including Magnolia, in an amount at least sufficient to allow Magnolia to pay its taxes and (ii) non-pro rata payments to Magnolia to reimburse it for its corporate and other overhead expenses. To the extent that Magnolia needs funds and Magnolia LLC or its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions or payments under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of any financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, Magnolia\u2019s liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nMagnolia\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of Magnolia\u2019s Class A Common Stock.\nMagnolia\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes its board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. If Magnolia\u2019s board of directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third-party to acquire Magnolia. In addition, some provisions of Magnolia\u2019s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and its bylaws could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of Magnolia, even if the change of control would be beneficial to its stockholders, including limitations on the removal of directors, limitations on the ability of Magnolia\u2019s stockholders to call special meetings, providing that the board of directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal Magnolia\u2019s bylaws, and establishing advance notice and certain information requirements for nominations for election to its board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, certain change of control events may have the effect of accelerating any payments due under Magnolia\u2019s RBL Facility, and could, in certain defined circumstances, require Magnolia to make an offer to repurchase its outstanding Senior Notes and/or result in the acceleration of payments required by the indenture governing its outstanding notes, which could be substantial and accordingly serve as a disincentive to a potential acquirer of the Company.\nFuture sales of Magnolia\u2019s Class A Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce Magnolia\u2019s stock price, and any additional capital raised by Magnolia through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in the Company.\nMagnolia may sell additional shares of Class A Common Stock or securities convertible into shares of its Class A Common Stock in subsequent offerings. Magnolia cannot predict the size of future issuances of its Class A Common Stock or securities convertible into Class A Common Stock or the effect, if any, that such future issuances will have on the market price of its Class A Common Stock. Sales of substantial amounts of Magnolia\u2019s Class A Common Stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition or in connection with Magnolia\u2019s existing or future equity compensation plans), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of its Class A Common Stock.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of Magnolia\u2019s income or other tax returns could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nMagnolia is subject to taxes by U.S. federal, state, and local tax authorities. Magnolia\u2019s future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the valuation of Magnolia\u2019s deferred tax assets and liabilities, expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances, tax effects of stock based compensation, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof.\nIn addition, Magnolia may be subject to audits of its income, sales, and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal, state, and local taxing authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 16771, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "MGY"}
