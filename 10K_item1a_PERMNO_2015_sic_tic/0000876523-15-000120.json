{"cik": "876523", "company": "EZCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-12-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nThere are many risks and uncertainties that may affect our operations, performance, development and results. Many of these risks are beyond our control. The following is a description of the important risk factors that may affect our business. If any of these risks were to actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have restated prior consolidated financial statements, which may lead to additional risks and uncertainties, including loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price.\nWe have restated our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (including the quarterly periods within those years, other than the first quarter of fiscal 2012) and for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 in order to correct certain accounting errors related to our Grupo Finmart loan portfolio (the \u201cRestatement\u201d). For a description of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management in connection with the Restatement and management\u2019s plan to remediate those material weaknesses, see \u201cPart II, Item 9A - Controls and Procedures.\u201d\nAs a result of the Restatement and the circumstances giving rise to the Restatement, we have become subject to a number of additional costs and risks, including (a) accounting and legal fees incurred in connection with the Restatement and (b) legal fees, and possibly substantial damages or settlement costs, in connection with related stockholder litigation (as described in \u201cFederal Securities Litigation\u201d in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cPart II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d). In addition, the Restatement may lead to a loss of investor confidence and have negative impacts on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that, if not remediated, could result in additional material misstatements in our financial statements.\nAs described in \u201cPart II, Item 9A - Controls and Procedures,\u201d in connection with the Restatement, management identified control deficiencies that, collectively, represent material weaknesses (which had not been remediated as of September 30, 2015). In addition, in connection with the preparation of this Report, management identified other control deficiencies that,\ncollectively, represent an additional material weakness. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of the identified material weaknesses, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2015. See \u201cPart II, Item 9A - Controls and Procedures.\u201d\nWe are developing and implementing a remediation plan to address the material weaknesses. If our remediation efforts are insufficient or if additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the material weakness, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.\nChanges in laws and regulations affecting our products and services could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\nOur products and services are subject to extensive regulation under various federal, state and local laws and regulations. Adverse legislation or regulations could be adopted in any country, state or municipality in which we operate. If such legislation or regulation is adopted in any particular jurisdiction, we generally evaluate our business in the context of the new rules and determine whether we can continue to operate in that jurisdiction with new or modified products or whether it is feasible to enhance our business with additional product offerings. In any case, if we are unable to continue to operate profitably under the new rules, we may decide to close or consolidate stores, resulting in decreased revenues, earnings and assets. For example, the U.S. Department of Defense recently issued a final rule that expands certain protections under the Military Lending Act (MLA) to a wider range of credit products, including pawn loans. As a result, effective October 2016, pawn loans to active duty service members and their dependents will be subject to a 36% APR rate cap.\nLitigation and regulatory proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are currently subject to various litigation and regulatory actions, including those described in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cPart II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur. An unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or an injunction prohibiting us from conducting our business as we currently do. Any unfavorable ruling or outcome could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could negatively affect our reputation.\nWe have procured management liability insurance policies that should protect us from much of the potential exposure related to the shareholder derivative litigation and the federal securities litigation described in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cPart II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d However, under the terms of those policies, we bear the first $1 million of costs or liability associated with each claim. Consequently, our results of operations will be adversely affected by the current litigation until we exhaust the retention under our management liability insurance policies. In addition, to the extent that our ultimate liability in the current litigation or any subsequent litigation that is included in the same policy year exceeds the management liability policy limits, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOne person beneficially owns all of our voting stock and controls the outcome of all matters requiring a vote of stockholders, which may influence the value of our publicly-traded non-voting stock.\nPhillip E. Cohen is the beneficial owner of all of our Class B Voting Common Stock. As a result of his equity ownership stake, Mr. Cohen controls the outcome of all issues requiring a vote of stockholders and has the ability to appoint or remove directors who control our policies and operations. All of our publicly-traded stock is non-voting stock. Consequently, stockholders other than Mr. Cohen have no vote with respect to the election of directors or any other matter requiring a vote of stockholders except as required by law. This lack of voting rights may adversely affect the market value of our publicly-traded Class A Non-Voting Common Stock.\nIn July 2014, the sole voting stockholder made changes to the Company\u2019s Bylaws that generally restructure certain aspects of the Company\u2019s corporate governance. Those changes, which are described in the Company\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K dated July 18, 2014, permit the voting stockholders to fill vacancies on the Board of Directors and appoint and remove the Chairman of the Board and officers of the Company; provide that the presence of 100% of the directors is necessary to constitute a quorum at any meeting of the Board; and provide that the affirmative vote of 100% of the directors is necessary to approve any resolution of the Board.\nA significant portion of our business is concentrated in Texas.\nAs of September 30, 2015, a significant portion of our U.S. pawn stores were located in Texas, and those stores account for a significant portion of our revenues and profitability. The legislative, regulatory and general business environment in Texas has been relatively favorable for our pawn business activities, but a negative legislative or regulatory change in Texas could have a material adverse effect on our overall operations and financial performance.\nA significant or sudden decrease in gold values or the volume of gold transactions may have a material impact on our earnings and financial position.\nGold jewelry comprises a large portion of the collateral security for our pawn loans and our inventory. Pawn service charges, sales proceeds and our ability to liquidate excess jewelry inventory at an acceptable margin are dependent upon gold values and the volume of gold transactions. A decline in the availability of gold or our customers\u2019 willingness or ability to sell us gold or use gold as collateral for pawn loans could impact our business. Over the fiscal 2013 to 2015 periods, we experienced a significant softening of gold prices and volumes, which had a negative impact on our profitability. The impact on our financial position and results of operations of a continued decrease in gold values or volumes or a change in customer behavior cannot be reasonably estimated because the market and customer response to changes in gold values is not known; however, a significant decline in gold values or gold volumes could result in decreases in sales, sales margins and pawn service charge revenues.\nA significant change in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial position.\nWe have foreign operations in Mexico and Canada and an equity investment in Australia. Our assets and investments in, and earnings and dividends from, each of these must be translated to U.S. dollars from their respective functional currencies. A significant weakening of any of these foreign currencies could result in lower assets and earnings in U.S. dollars, resulting in a potentially material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn part, achievement of our growth objectives is dependent upon our ability to open and acquire new stores.\nOur expansion strategy includes acquiring existing stores and opening de novo store locations. Our acquisition strategy is dependent upon the availability of attractive acquisition candidates, while the success of our de novo store strategy is contingent upon numerous factors that cannot be predicted or controlled, such as the availability of acceptable locations with a desirable customer base, the negotiation of acceptable lease terms, the ability to obtain required government permits and licenses and the existence of a suitable competitive environment. The achievement of our growth objectives is also subject to our ability to attract, train and retain qualified team members. Failure to achieve our expansion goals could adversely affect our prospects and future results of operations.\nChanges in the business, regulatory or political climate in Mexico could adversely affect our operations there, which could adversely affect our growth plans.\nOur growth plans include potential expansion in Mexico. Changes in the business, regulatory or political climate in Mexico, or significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates, could affect our ability to expand or continue our operations there, which could have a material adverse impact on our prospects, results of operations and cash flows.\nFluctuations in our sales, pawn loan balances, sales margins and pawn redemption rates could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe regularly experience fluctuations in a variety of operating metrics. Changes in any of these metrics, as might be caused by changes in the economic environment, competitive pressures, changes in customers\u2019 tastes and preferences or a significant decrease in gold prices could materially and adversely affect our profitability and ability to achieve our planned results of operations.\nChanges in our liquidity and capital requirements or in banks\u2019 abilities or willingness to lend to us could limit our ability to achieve our plans.\nA significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results. During fiscal 2014, we completed the sale of $230 million principal amount of 2.125% Cash Convertible Senior Notes Due 2019 and used the proceeds to, among other things, pay all outstanding amounts under, and terminate, our revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks. Our ability to obtain additional credit or alternative financing, if needed, will depend upon market conditions, our financial condition and banks\u2019 or other lenders\u2019 willingness to lend capital at acceptable rates. The inability to access capital at acceptable rates and terms could restrict or limit our ability to achieve our growth objectives, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in competition from various sources could have a material adverse impact on our ability to achieve our plans.\nWe encounter significant competition from other pawn stores, other consumer lending companies and other retailers, many of which have significantly greater financial resources than we do. Increases in the number or size of competitors or other changes in competitive influences could adversely affect our operations.\nInfrastructure failures and breaches in data security could harm our business.\nWe depend on our information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives. If a problem, such as a computer virus, intentional disruption by a third party, natural disaster, telecommunications system failure or lost connectivity impairs our infrastructure, we may be unable to process transactions or otherwise carry on our business. An infrastructure disruption could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers and revenue, result in the unintentional disclosure of company or customer information and require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related data security concerns.\nWe invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments.\nWe currently have a significant investment in Cash Converters International Limited, which is a publicly-traded company based in Australia. We have made this investment, and may in the future make additional investments in this or other companies, to further our strategic objectives. The success of these strategic investments is dependent on a variety of factors, including the business performance of the companies in which we invest and the market\u2019s assessment of that performance. If the business performance of any of these companies suffers, then the value of our investment may decline. If we determine that an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value exists for one of our equity investments, we will be required to write down that investment to its fair value and recognize the related write-down as an investment loss. Any realized investment loss would adversely affect our results of operations. We wrote down a portion of our investment in Cash Converters International Limited during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cPart II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data.\u201d\nWe may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by insurance.\nWe maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property, casualty and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time, depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis. Losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and may increase our expenses, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur acquisitions, investments and other transactions could disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, investments and other transactions. These transactions may involve significant challenges and risks, including risks that we may not realize the expected return on an acquisition or investment, that we may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired business, or that we may experience difficulty in integrating acquired businesses into our business systems and processes. If we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, investments or other transactions, we may fail to complete them due to inability to obtain required regulatory or other approvals or other factors. Furthermore, acquisitions, investments and other transactions require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. These factors could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new tax laws in the U.S. or other countries, or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and several foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax rates in any of these jurisdictions subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.\nEvents beyond our control could result in business interruption or other adverse effects on our operations and growth.\nOur business or operations could be subject to interruption or damage due to inclement weather, natural disaster, power loss, acts of violence, terrorist attacks, war or similar events. Such events could impair our customers' access to our business, impact our ability to expand or continue our operations or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur Mexican payroll withholding business is highly dependent on the relationships that we build and sustain with state and local governments and labor unions.\nGrupo Finmart and its brokers promote our payroll loan products through public-sector employers in governmental agencies across Mexico. If we are not able to maintain relationships with these entities or increase our distribution network through new relationships with other federal, state and local governments or labor unions, our ability to originate new payroll loans could be diminished, which would reduce the size of our payroll withholding lending loan portfolio. In addition, despite contractual arrangements which provide that the payroll counterparty will continue to deduct payments even if our relationship with that entity is terminated, the credit risk of our existing payroll loan portfolio could increase because payroll deduction payments on existing payroll loans could be disrupted, whether due to our severing a relationship with a broker or otherwise.\nGoodwill comprises a significant portion of our total assets. We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, which could result in a material, non-cash write-down and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nThe carrying value of our goodwill was $327.5 million, or approximately 27% of our total assets, as of September 30, 2015. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350-20-35 Goodwill - Subsequent Measurement, we test goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life for potential impairment annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, a change in strategic direction, legal factors, operating performance indicators, a change in the competitive environment, the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, or future economic factors such as unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flows of our reporting units. Our annual goodwill impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter utilizing the income approach. This approach uses future cash flows and estimated terminal values for each of our reporting units (discounted using a market participant perspective) to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which is then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if there is an impairment. The income approach includes assumptions about revenue growth rates, operating margins and terminal growth rates discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital derived from other publicly-traded companies that are similar but not identical from an operational and economic standpoint. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cPart II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a discussion of the impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during fiscal 2015.\nIf our estimates of allowance for loan losses are not adequate to absorb losses, our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses for estimated probable losses, as described under \u201cBad Debt and Allowance for Losses\u201d in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \"Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d As of September 30, 2015, our aggregate reserve and allowance for losses on loans was $65.0 million. See Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cPart II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d The amount of reserves and allowances is based on our current assessment of and expectations concerning various factors affecting the quality of our loan portfolio. These factors include, among other things, our borrowers\u2019 financial condition, repayment abilities and repayment intentions. This reserve, however, is an estimate, and if actual losses are greater than our reserve and allowance, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under applicable anti-corruption laws, and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have business in countries and regions that are less developed and are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business environments. Our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"). We have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. If employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions. Violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, and we may be subject to other liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face other risks discussed under \"Part II, Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\"", "PERMNO": 76798, "SIC": 5900, "TIC": "EZPW"}
