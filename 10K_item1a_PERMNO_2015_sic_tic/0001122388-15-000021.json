If any of the following risks materialize, our business could be materially harmed, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe experienced a system outage in March 2014 that prevented some of our customers from being able to access certain of our services. This system interruption and future system interruptions that impair access to the Ellie Mae Network or SaaS Encompass could damage our reputation and brand and may substantially harm our business.\nThe satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of SaaS Encompass, the Ellie Mae Network, our website, our services, including our Encompass Compliance Service, and our network infrastructure are critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain Ellie Mae Network participants and Encompass users. Because our service is complex and incorporates a variety of hardware and proprietary and third-party software, our service may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers. Internet-based services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released, and we have from time to time found defects in our service and new errors in our service may be detected in the future. In addition, our customers may use our service in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in service for other customers attempting to access their data.\nMoreover, we have experienced and may in the future continue to experience temporary system interruptions, either to the Ellie Mae Network or to SaaS Encompass hosting locations, for a variety of reasons, including network failures, power failures, software errors, problems with Encompass and other third-party firmware updates, as well as an overwhelming number of Ellie Mae Network participants and Encompass users trying to access our network during periods of strong demand. For example, on March 31, 2014, we experienced a system outage that prevented some of our customers from being able to access certain of our services until the system was restored on April 1, 2014. Since our customers use our service for important aspects of their business, any errors, defects, disruptions in service or other performance problems could result in negative publicity, damage our reputation and brand, reduce our revenue, increase our operating expenses, negatively impact our ability to run our business, hinder our ability to enroll new customers and cause us to lose current customers, all of which could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nIn addition, our two primary data centers, located in Santa Clara, California and Chicago, Illinois, are hosted by a third-party service provider over which we maintain regular oversight but have little direct control. We depend on this third-party service provider to provide continuous and uninterrupted access to the Ellie Mae Network and SaaS Encompass. If for any reason our relationship with this third party were to end unexpectedly, it could require a significant amount of time to transition the hosting\nof our data centers to a new third-party service provider. We are also subject to interruptions beyond our and our third-party service provider\u2019s control, such as disruptions or congestion in the portions of the Internet linking us to our customers. Since we are dependent on third parties for the implementation and maintenance of certain aspects of our systems and because some of the causes of system interruptions may be outside of our control, we may not be able to remedy such interruptions in a timely manner.\nOur future performance will be highly dependent on our ability to continue to attract SaaS Encompass customers and grow revenues from new on-demand services.\nTo maintain or increase our revenues, we must increase the number of users of our software and the percentage of our software users who choose our on-demand SaaS Encompass offering, from which we generate greater revenues than from our on-premise license offering for which we will no longer provide software releases or technical support beginning in May 2016. We cannot guarantee our on-demand SaaS strategy, including our Success-Based Pricing model, will continue to be successful. If we are unable to increase the number of SaaS Encompass customers, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nOur success will depend, to a large extent, on the willingness of mortgage lenders to continue to accept the SaaS model for delivering software applications that they view as critical to the success of their business. Our success will substantially depend on our ability to convince enterprises using on-premise enterprise software solutions to invest significant personnel and financial resources to migrate to our SaaS offering. It is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand for our services, the future growth rate and size of the SaaS market or the entry of competitive applications. The growth of the SaaS market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with SaaS offerings, as well as the ability of SaaS companies to address security and privacy concerns. If other SaaS providers experience security incidents, loss of customer data, disruptions in delivery or other problems, the market for SaaS applications as a whole, including our own products and services, may be negatively affected. If there is a reduction in demand for SaaS caused by technological challenges, weakening economic conditions, security or privacy concerns, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending or otherwise, it could result in decreased revenues and our business could be adversely affected.\nIn order to grow our business, we must expand the use of settlement services on, and increase the number of transactions effected through, the Ellie Mae Network.\nTo grow our base of Ellie Mae Network participants, we and settlement service providers must continue to enhance the features and functionality of offerings to them. In addition, increasing the number of settlement service transactions effected through the Ellie Mae Network will depend, in part, on settlement service providers enhancing their technical capabilities, which is largely beyond our control.\nWe must also convince a variety of potential Ellie Mae Network participants, including mortgage lenders, originators, settlement service providers and mega lenders, of the benefits of electronic origination and network participation as compared to traditional mortgage origination methods including paper, facsimile, courier, mail and email.\nWe cannot guarantee that our Ellie Mae Network and other service offerings will achieve market acceptance. In the event these efforts are not successful, our business and growth prospects would be adversely affected.\nOur failure to protect the confidential information of our Encompass users, our Ellie Mae Network participants and their respective customers could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business.\nCertain confidential information relating to our Encompass users, our Ellie Mae Network participants and their respective customers resides on our third-party hosted data center servers and is transmitted over our network. We rely on encryption as well as authentication technology licensed from third parties to effect secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including personal information and credit card numbers. These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, service provider error, malfeasance or otherwise. Customer data or our confidential information may be lost as a result of employee error or malfeasance. Our servers may also be vulnerable to computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems, which could result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our IT systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. The possession and use of personal information in conducting our business subject us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require notification to customers in the event of a security breach, restrict our use of personal information and hinder our ability to acquire new customers or market to existing customers.\nWe cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent security breaches. Any such compromise of our security could damage our reputation and brand and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation or regulatory actions and potential liability, which would substantially harm our business and operating results. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against and remedy any potential security breaches and their consequences.\nWe cannot accurately predict subscription renewal or upgrade rates and the impact these rates may have on our future revenues and operating results.\nOur customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period, which ranges from one to five years. They may also choose to renew their subscriptions at lower levels. In addition, in the first year of a subscription, customers often purchase a higher level of professional services than they do in renewal years. As a result, our ability to grow is dependent in part on customers purchasing additional subscriptions and services after the initial subscription term. We cannot accurately predict renewal rates given our varied customer base and the number of multi-year subscription contracts. Our customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our services, the prices of our services, the prices of services offered by our competitors or reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels due to the macroeconomic environment or other factors. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services, renew on less favorable terms or do not purchase additional subscriptions or services, our revenues may grow more slowly than expected or decline and our profitability and gross margin percentage may be harmed.\nMortgage lending volume was significantly lower in 2014 than in 2013, and may decrease further in 2015 and future years, which would materially adversely affect our business.\nMortgage lending volume was significantly lower in 2014 than in 2013, and may decrease further in 2015 and future years. Factors that adversely impact mortgage lending volumes include increasing mortgage interest rates, reduced consumer and investor demand for mortgages, more stringent underwriting guidelines, decreased liquidity in the secondary mortgage market, high levels of unemployment, high levels of consumer debt, lower consumer confidence, changes in tax and other regulatory policies, the number of existing mortgages eligible for refinancing and other macroeconomic factors.\nMortgage interest rates are influenced by a number of factors, including monetary policy. The Federal Reserve Bank may raise the federal funds rate, which would likely cause mortgage interest rates to rise. Increases in mortgage interest rates could reduce the volume of new mortgages originated, in particular the volume of mortgage refinancings. Additionally, because the ratio of applications to closed loans typically is greater with refinancings than with purchase loans, a continued decrease in refinancings would result in fewer mortgage applications per funded loan. Since we generate some Ellie Mae Network revenues during the application process, regardless of whether the loan is eventually funded, this may continue to negatively impact our transaction based revenue.\nWe currently estimate that approximately 30% to 40% of our revenues have some sensitivity to volume. To the extent there is an additional decrease in residential mortgage volumes in 2015 compared to 2014, we would need to increase our user base and/or our revenue per loan processed by our customers in order to maintain our financial performance. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in these efforts, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nA significant decline in mortgage origination volume, such as the significant drop in mortgage volume that occurred in 2014, could also negatively impact our customers, resulting in a reduction of their Encompass users, consolidation with other lenders or cessation of operations. If any of these occurs, it could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur revenues and operating results have in the past varied and could in the future vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year because of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition to other risk factors discussed in this section, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\n\u2022\nthe number of Encompass users;\n\u2022\nthe volume of mortgages originated by Encompass users, especially users on our Success-Based Pricing model;\n\u2022\ntransaction volume on the Ellie Mae Network;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in mortgage lending volume;\n\u2022\nthe relative mix of purchase and refinance volume handled by Encompass users;\n\u2022\nthe level of demand for our services;\n\u2022\nthe timing of the introduction and acceptance of Ellie Mae Network offerings and new on-demand services;\n\u2022\nany write-downs in the value of our property and equipment or intangible assets as a result of our investment or acquisition activities;\n\u2022\ncosts associated with defending intellectual property infringement and other claims; and\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulation affecting Ellie Mae Network participants or our business.\nDue to these and other factors, our future results may not reach our internal projections. In addition, our operating results in future periods may not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts who follow our company, which could cause our stock price to decline rapidly and significantly. The results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance.\nSince part of our sales efforts are targeted at larger customers, our sales cycle may become longer and more expensive, we may encounter pricing pressure and implementation and customization challenges, and we may have to delay revenue recognition for some complex transactions, all of which could harm our business and operating results.\nPart of our business strategy is to target larger mortgage lenders that handle greater volumes of loans. As we target more of our sales efforts at larger customers, we could face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. In this market, the customer\u2019s decision to use our products and services may be an enterprise-wide decision and, if so, this type of sale could require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our products and services. In addition, larger customers may demand more customization, implementation services and features. As a result of these factors, these sales opportunities may require us to devote greater sales support and professional services resources to individual customers, driving up costs and time required to complete sales and diverting our own sales and professional services resources to a smaller number of larger transactions, while potentially requiring us to delay revenue recognition on some of these transactions until the technical or implementation requirements have been met.\nSupporting our existing and growing customer base could strain our personnel resources, and if we are unable to scale our operations and increase productivity, we may not be able to successfully implement our business plan.\nWe continue to experience significant growth in our customer base, which has placed a strain on our management and administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. Additional investments in our implementation capabilities and research and development and general and administrative spending will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, address the needs of our customers, further develop and enhance our products and services and scale with the overall growth of our company.\nIn addition, professional services, such as implementation services, are a key aspect of on-boarding new customers. The implementation process is complicated and we will need to scale our capabilities in this area to meet future revenue targets. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or with the type of services or solutions delivered, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the customer\u2019s dissatisfaction with our products and services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers.\nOur business strategy will place significant demands on our management and our infrastructure and will require significant expenditures and resources.\nOur strategy of growing our business has placed and may continue to place significant demands on our management and our administrative, operational and financial infrastructure. As our operations grow in size, scope and complexity, we will need to improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure, including our data centers and financial reporting systems. These upgrades and improvements are necessary in order to offer an increasing number of customers enhanced solutions, features and functionality and to ensure continued adequate controls over financial reporting.\nIn addition, the expansion of our systems and infrastructure and improvements to our products will require us to commit substantial financial, operational and technical resources in advance of any anticipated increase in the volume of business, with no assurance that the volume of business or our revenues will actually increase. For example, during 2015, we currently anticipate that we will increase our investment in research and development, enterprise sales, services, technical support, security and our data center infrastructure, including in connection with the development of our next generation Encompass platform. Continued growth could also strain our ability to maintain reliable service levels for our customers, develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures and recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel.\nManaging our growth will require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources. We have been aggressively hiring talent in all areas of our business, which has significantly increased our expenses. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows, our business would be harmed. We periodically upgrade and/or replace various software systems to support our growth, including our new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Unanticipated problems impacting the implementation of these systems could significantly increase the expenditures and resources allocated to them, divert the attention of management and harm our business. If the implementations of new applications are delayed, or if we encounter unforeseen problem with our new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted.\nIntegrating future acquisitions could disrupt our business, harm our financial condition and operating results or dilute or adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to expand our solutions and services and to grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary businesses, solutions or technologies rather than through internal development. For example, in October 1, 2014, we acquired substantially all the assets of Mortgage Resource Center, Inc., dba AllRegs, a provider of research and reference, education, documentation and data and analytics products relating to the mortgage industry. In January 2014, we acquired substantially all the assets of ARG Interactive, LLC (dba MortgageCEO), a SaaS company specializing in customer relationship management and marketing solutions for the residential mortgage industry.\nThe identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions successfully. Moreover, if such acquisitions require us to seek additional debt or equity financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on terms favorable to us or at all. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks which may have a negative impact on our results of operations, including:\n\u2022\nwrite-offs of acquired assets or investments;\n\u2022\npotential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers;\n\u2022\nunknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology;\n\u2022\nlimitations to our ability to recognize revenue from acquired deferred revenue;\n\u2022\ndepreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation; and\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences of any such acquisitions.\nFor example, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge to intangible assets acquired from MortgageCEO.\nEven if we successfully complete an acquisition, we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively the acquired business, technologies, solutions, assets, personnel or operations, particularly if key personnel of an acquired company decide not to work for us. We may encounter difficulty in incorporating acquired technologies into our service and maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our brand and reputation. In addition, we may issue debt or equity securities to complete an acquisition, which could dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nEvents similar to the extreme turmoil in the residential mortgage industry that occurred from 2007 to 2009 could adversely affect our business.\nFrom 2007 to 2009, the worldwide credit market was severely disrupted by the global financial crisis due to the precipitous rise of sub-prime mortgage delinquencies and resulting failure of securities backed by mortgages, including these sub-prime mortgages. This crisis resulted in extreme turmoil in the residential mortgage industry and caused many mortgage originators and other mortgage industry participants to go out of business. If the residential mortgage industry were to experience another similar disruptive event, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe residential mortgage industry is heavily regulated and changes in current legislation or new legislation could adversely affect our business.\nChanges in the regulations that govern our customers could adversely affect our business.\nThe U.S. mortgage industry is heavily regulated. Federal and state governments and agencies could enact legislation or other policies that could negatively impact the business of our Encompass users and other Ellie Mae Network participants. Any changes to existing laws or regulations or adoption of new laws or regulations that increase restrictions on the residential mortgage industry may decrease residential mortgage volume or otherwise limit the ability of our Encompass users and Ellie Mae Network participants to operate their businesses, resulting in decreased usage of our solutions.\nChanges in current legislation or new legislation may increase our costs by requiring us to update our products and services.\nChanges to existing laws or regulations or adoption of new laws or regulations relating to the residential mortgage industry could require us to incur significant costs to update our products and services. Our Encompass Compliance Service analyzes mortgage loan data for compliance with consumer protection laws and institutionally mandated compliance policies and must continually be updated to incorporate changes to such laws and policies. The Dodd-Frank Act has caused and will continue to cause us to make similar updates to Encompass, Encompass Product and Pricing Service, Encompass Docs Solution, TQL and the Ellie Mae Network to address, among other things, regulations that protect consumers against unfair, deceptive and abusive practices by lenders. For example, additional tools and product updates were recently required to address the Ability-to-Repay, or ATR, / Qualified Mortgage, or QM, and Federal and State High Cost rules that became effective in January 2014. In addition, we will be updating certain of our products to comply with the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure rule changes that take effect in August 2015. These additions and updates have caused us to incur significant expense, and future updates will likely similarly cause us to incur significant expense. In addition, if our products and services fail to address relevant laws and regulations, we could be subject to claims by our customers that we have breached the warranty provisions in our customer contracts. Such claims could result in substantial costs and we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nPotential structural changes in the U.S. residential mortgage industry, in particular plans to diminish the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, could disrupt the residential mortgage market and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a very important role in providing liquidity, stability and affordability in the current U.S. residential mortgage market. In particular, they participate in the secondary mortgage market by purchasing mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities for investment and by issuing guaranteed mortgage-related securities. In February 2011, the Obama administration delivered a report to Congress which proposed the winding down of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and shrinking the federal government\u2019s role in the housing market. This proposal includes the withdrawal of government guarantees currently available for certain residential loans and increasing the down payment requirements for borrowers, both of which could reduce mortgage lending volume. In February 2012, the Federal Housing Finance Agency sent Congress a strategic plan to wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac over the next several years. This proposal includes building a new infrastructure for the secondary mortgage market, continuing to shrink Fannie Mae\u2019s and Freddie Mac\u2019s operations by eliminating the direct funding of mortgages and shifting mortgage credit risk to private investors and maintaining foreclosure prevention activities and credit availability. In August 2012, the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced it would require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to reduce their investment portfolios more quickly, at an annual rate of 15% versus the previous rate of 10%. In June 2013, the U.S. Senate introduced a bill to wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac over five years. This legislation would replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with a new Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation that would continue to guarantee mortgages, but only after private capital absorbs the first 10% of any losses. In July 2013, the U.S. House of Representatives also unveiled draft legislation to similarly wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac over a five year period. In 2014, four Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reform measures were active in Congress: the Senate\u2019s Johnson-Crapo and Corker-Warner, and the House\u2019s PATH Act and HOME Forward Act. The effects of these proposals, the passage of either of these bills into law or any significant structural change to the U.S. residential mortgage industry may cause significant disruption to the residential mortgage market. If we are unable to react effectively and quickly to changes in the residential mortgage industry, our business could be harmed.\nWe may be limited in the way in which we market our business or generate revenue by U.S. federal law prohibiting referral fees in real estate transactions, and if we are found to be in violation of such laws we would be subject to significant liability.\nRESPA generally prohibits the payment or receipt of fees or any other thing of value for the referral of business related to a residential real estate settlement service and prohibits fee shares or splits or unearned fees in connection with the provision of such services. Encompass software and services and the Ellie Mae Network were designed with payment methods that are not currently prohibited by the restrictions under RESPA. Nonetheless, RESPA may restrict our ability to enter into marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties for existing or newly developed products and services, particularly to the extent that\nsuch arrangements may be characterized as involving payments for the referral of residential real estate settlement service business. Additionally, any amendments to RESPA or court opinions interpreting the provisions of RESPA that result in restrictions on our current payment methods, or any determination that our payment methods have been and currently are subject to the restrictions under RESPA, could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we were found to be in violation of RESPA rules, we would be exposed to significant potential liability that could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nWe depend on key and highly skilled personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain our current or hire additional personnel, our ability to develop and successfully market our business could be harmed.\nWe believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, technical, finance, creative and sales and marketing personnel. Moreover, we believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of our named executive officers. All of our officers and other employees are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. In addition, the loss of any key employees or the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel could delay the development and introduction of, and harm our ability to sell, our solutions and harm the market\u2019s perception of us. Competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. We may be unable to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals who are capable of meeting our growing sales, operational and managerial requirements, or may be required to pay increased compensation in order to do so. If we are unable to attract and retain the qualified personnel we need to succeed, our business will suffer.\nVolatility or lack of performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain our key employees. Our named executive officers are vested in a substantial amount of stock options and performance share awards. Employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their vested options have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares or the exercise prices of the vested options, or if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly above the market price of our common stock. If we are unable to retain our named executive officers or other key employees, our business will be harmed.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market, which could make it difficult for us to attract and retain Encompass users and Ellie Mae Network participants.\nThe mortgage origination software market is highly competitive. There are many software providers, such as: Byte Software Inc., a subsidiary of CBCInnovis; Calyx Technology, Inc.; DH Corporation; Mortgage Builder Software, Inc., a subsidiary of Altisource Portfolio Solutions SA; Mortgage Cadence LLC, a subsidiary of Accenture PLC; and Wipro Gallagher Solutions, which is owned by Wipro, Ltd., that compete with us by offering loan origination software to mortgage originators. Some software providers, including Calyx Technology, Inc., also provide connectivity between their software users and lenders and service providers. Other connectivity alternatives are provided by services such as Black Knight Financial Services, LLC, a subsidiary of Fidelity National Financial, Inc., which aggregate service providers to make available such services to mortgage lenders. We also compete with compliance and document preparation service providers that are more established than us. There is vigorous competition among providers of these services and we may not succeed in convincing potential customers using other services to switch to ours. Many service providers connect directly to mortgage originators without using any loan origination software. In addition, some of our competitors are consolidating which facilitates greater cross-selling of services, which could weaken our ability to differentiate our offering in the market. Some of our competitors also offer services on a per closed loan basis, which could adversely impact the effectiveness of our Success-Based Pricing strategy for increasing the number of SaaS Encompass customers. If we are unsuccessful in competing effectively by providing attractive functionality, customer service or value, we could lose existing Encompass users to our competitors and our ability to attract new Encompass users could be harmed.\nWe only offer our Encompass services to Encompass users. There are many other service providers that offer our Encompass users competing services, including borrower-facing websites, document preparation services, compliance services and EDM. We may be unsuccessful in continuing to differentiate our Encompass service offerings to the extent necessary to effectively compete in some or all of these markets.\nThe Ellie Mae Network is only available to mortgage originators using Encompass. The principal alternative to the use of the Ellie Mae Network by Encompass users remains traditional methods of exchanging data and documents among mortgage industry participants by email, facsimile, phone, courier and mail. In addition, mortgage originators may use standalone web browsers to go individually to each investor, lender or service provider\u2019s website and then manually upload loan data or enter information into the website. Mortgage originators may continue to use these methods due to habit, personal business relationships or otherwise. The success of the Ellie Mae Network depends on our ability to achieve and offer access to both the critical mass of investors, lenders and service providers necessary to attract and retain mortgage originators using Encompass on the Ellie Mae\nNetwork and the critical mass of active mortgage originators necessary to attract and retain investors, lenders and service providers on our network.\nSome of our actual and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and, as a result, these companies may be able to respond more quickly to changes in regulations, new technologies or customer demands, or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their software and services than we can. In addition, we may face increased competition as a result of continuing industry consolidation, such as: Altisource Portfolio Solutions SA\u2019s acquisition of Mortgage Builder Software, Inc. in July 2014; Accenture PLC\u2019s acquisition of Mortgage Cadence LLC in August 2013; DH Corporation\u2019s acquisitions of Harland Financial Solutions in August 2013, Mortgagebot LLC in April 2011 and Avista Solutions, Inc. in May 2012; Optimal Blue, Inc.\u2019s acquisition of LoanSifter, Inc. in December 2013 and Fidelity National Financial, Inc.\u2019s acquisition of Lender Processing Services, Inc. in January 2014. We expect the mortgage origination market to continue to attract new competitors and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures we face will not materially adversely affect our business.\nFailure to adapt to technological changes may render our technology obsolete or decrease the attractiveness of our solutions to our customers.\nIf new industry standards and practices emerge, or if competitors introduce new solutions embodying new services or technologies, Encompass and the Ellie Mae Network technology may become obsolete. Our future success will depend on our ability to:\n\u2022\nenhance our existing solutions;\n\u2022\ndevelop and potentially license new solutions and technologies that address the needs of our prospective customers; and\n\u2022\nrespond to changes in industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis.\nWe must continue to enhance the features and functionality of Encompass, other Encompass services and the Ellie Mae Network. The effective performance, reliability and availability of Encompass, Encompass services and the Ellie Mae Network infrastructure are critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain Encompass users and Ellie Mae Network participants. If we do not continue to make investments in product development and, as a result, or due to other reasons, fail to attract new and retain existing mortgage originators, lenders, investors and service providers, we may lose existing Ellie Mae Network participants, which could significantly decrease the value of the Ellie Mae Network to all participants and materially adversely affect our business.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our business.\nThe protection of our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary Encompass software and Ellie Mae Network technology, is crucial to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret law and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. Our present and future patents may provide only limited protection for our technology and may not be sufficient to provide competitive advantage to us. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee any patents will be issued to us as a result of our patent applications. We also rely in part on confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, independent contractors and consultants. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our Ellie Mae Network and Encompass features and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary. Enforcing our proprietary rights is difficult and may not always be effective.\nWe have registered \u201cEllie Mae,\u201d \u201cEncompass\u201d and \u201cAllRegs\u201d and certain of our other trademarks as trademarks in the United States. Competitors may adopt service names similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to customer confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of the terms Ellie Mae, Encompass or our other trademarks.\nLitigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our patent and copyright rights, trade secrets and domain names and determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business.\nAssertions that we infringe third-party intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business.\nOther parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. For example, on March 25, 2011, we were named a defendant in a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Industry Access Incorporated alleging that our Encompass loan management software system and related operations infringes a patent and on March 19, 2013, Industry Access filed a second patent infringement lawsuit against us alleging that our products and services infringe two additional patents. We settled this matter in the third quarter of 2014. See Note 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, we generally agree to indemnify our customers against legal claims that our software products infringe intellectual property rights of third parties and, in the event of an infringement, to modify or replace the infringing product or, if those options are not reasonably possible, to refund the cost of the software, as pro-rated over a period of years. We cannot predict whether assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising from such assertions will substantially harm our business and operating results. If we are forced to defend against any infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, we may face costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. Furthermore, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to: pay damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if the infringement were found to be willful; cease providing solutions that allegedly incorporate the intellectual property of others; expend additional development resources to redesign or re-engineer our solutions and products, if feasible; and enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. We cannot be certain of the outcome of any litigation. Any royalty or licensing agreement, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale or distribution of some of our products and services and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements could be impaired, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports, significant expenses to remediate any internal control deficiencies and ultimately have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nAs a publicly-traded company, we are subject to compliance with, among other regulations, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX, which requires that we test our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Our compliance with SOX requires that we incur substantial expense and expend significant management time on compliance-related issues. If we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer material misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could harm our operating results and lead to a decline in our stock price. Additionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from the New York Stock Exchange, regulatory investigations, civil or criminal sanctions and class action litigation.\nAs a third-party technology service provider of mission-critical products and services to many financial institutions that are regulated by one or more member agencies of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, or FFIEC, we are subject to an IT examination by the member agencies of the FFIEC. As a result, the FFIEC conducts recurring IT Examinations in order to identify existing or potential risks associated with our operations that could adversely affect the financial institutions to whom we provide products and services, evaluate our risk management systems and controls and determine our compliance with applicable laws that affect the products and services we provide to financial institutions. In addition to examining areas such as our management of technology, data integrity, information confidentiality and service availability, the reviews also assess our financial stability. In June 2014 the FDIC, a member agency of the FFIEC, completed its IT examination, and found that, while the services we provide to our client banks are satisfactory, several matters required further attention, some of which were repeat findings and recommendations from the FDIC\u2019s 2012 examination. Although management has developed a plan for addressing these matters, we cannot be assured that the plan will satisfy the FDIC or applicable law. A sufficiently unfavorable review from the FFIEC in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIf one or more U.S. states or local jurisdictions successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect additional sales or use taxes on our fees, we could be subject to additional liability with respect to past or future sales, and the results of our operations could be adversely affected.\nWe do not collect state and local sales and use taxes on all sales in all jurisdictions in which our customers are located, based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable. Sales and use tax laws and rates vary by jurisdiction and such laws are subject to interpretation. Jurisdictions in which we do not collect sales and use taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in the assessment of such taxes, interest and penalties, and we could be required to collect such taxes in the future. This additional sales and use tax liability could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fires, floods and other natural catastrophic events and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism.\nOur systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war and similar events. For example, a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or flood, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Our corporate offices and one of the facilities we lease to house our computer and telecommunications equipment are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. In addition, acts of terrorism, which may be targeted at metropolitan areas with higher population density than rural areas, could cause disruptions in our or our customers\u2019 businesses or the economy as a whole. We may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in certain circumstances, such as natural disasters affecting the San Francisco Bay Area, and our business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur.\nOur stock price is volatile and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, these factors include:\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the operating performance of similar companies;\n\u2022\nthe overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nthe number of shares our common stock publicly owned and available for trading;\n\u2022\nthreatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations relating to our solutions;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or our industry or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nlarge volumes of sales of our shares of common stock by existing stockholders; and\n\u2022\ngeneral political and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our business.\nOur stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nOur board of directors previously approved a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $75.0 million of our common stock over a 36-month period, all of which remains available as of December 31, 2014. Such stock repurchases may be limited, suspended, or terminated at any time without prior notice. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program or that any future repurchases will have a positive impact on the trading price of our common stock or earnings per share. Important factors that could cause us to limit, suspend or terminate our stock repurchase program include, among others, unfavorable market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, the nature of other investment or strategic opportunities presented to us from time to time, the rate of dilution of our equity compensation programs, the availability of adequate funds, and our ability to make appropriate, timely, and beneficial decisions as to when, how, and whether to purchase shares under the stock repurchase program. If we limit, suspend or terminate our stock repurchase program, our stock price may be negatively affected.\nIf securities or industry analysts discontinue publishing research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to determine to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president or the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction.", "PERMNO": 12645, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "ELLI"}
