{"cik": "883237", "company": "VIRTUS INVESTMENT PARTNERS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThis section describes some of the potential risks relating to our business. The risks described below are some of the more important factors that could affect our business. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating the Company and our common stock. If\nany of the risks described below actually occur, our business, revenues, profitability, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRY, BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS\nWe earn substantially all of our revenues based on assets under management, which fluctuate based on many factors, including market conditions, investment performance and client withdrawals, and any reduction would reduce our revenues and profitability.\nThe majority of our revenues are generated from asset-based fees from investment management products and services to individuals and institutions. Therefore, if assets under management decline, our fee revenues would decline, reducing profitability as certain of our expenses are fixed or have contractual terms. Assets under management could decline due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25aaGeneral domestic and global economic and political conditions. Capital, equity and credit markets can experience substantial volatility. Changes in interest rates, the availability and cost of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws, trade barriers, commodity prices, currency exchange rates and controls, and national and international political circumstances (including wars, terrorist acts, pandemics, civil unrest and security operations) and other conditions may impact the capital, equity and credit markets which may impact our assets under management. Employment rates, economic weakness and budgetary challenges in parts of the world, the impact of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, uncertainty regarding international trade policies, regional turmoil in the Middle East, concern over prospects in China and emerging markets, growing debt for certain countries, and uncertainty about the consequences of governments withdrawing monetary stimulus all indicate that economic and political conditions remain unpredictable.\nIf the security markets decline or experience volatility, our assets under management and our revenues could be negatively impacted. Changes in currency exchange rates, such as an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to non-U.S. currencies, could result in a decrease in the U.S. dollar value of assets under management that are denominated in non-U.S. currencies. In addition, diminishing investor confidence in the markets and/or adverse market conditions could result in a decrease in investor risk tolerance. Such a decrease could prompt investors to reduce their rate of investment or to fully withdraw from markets, which could reduce our overall assets under management and have an adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and growth prospects.\nThe volatility in the markets in the past has highlighted the interconnection of the global markets and demonstrated how the deteriorating financial condition of one institution may materially adversely impact the performance of other institutions. Our assets under management have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and may be exposed to credit, operational or other risk due to the default by a counterparty or client or in the event of a market failure or disruption. In the event of extreme circumstances, including economic, political or business crises, such as a widespread systemic failure in the global financial system or failures of firms that have significant obligations as counterparties, we may suffer significant declines in assets under management and severe liquidity or valuation issues.\n\u25aaPrice declines in specific securities, market segments or geographic areas where those assets are invested. Funds and portfolios that we manage that are focused on certain geographic markets and industry sectors, are particularly vulnerable to political, social and economic events in those markets and sectors. If these markets or industries decline or experience volatility, this could have a negative impact on our assets under management and our revenues. For example, certain non-U.S. markets, particularly emerging markets, are not as developed or as efficient as the U.S. financial markets and, as a result, may be less liquid, less regulated and significantly more volatile than the U.S. financial markets. Liquidity in such markets may be adversely impacted by factors including political or economic events, government policies, expropriation, volume trading limits by foreign investors, and social or civil unrest, etc. These factors may negatively impact the market value of an investment or our ability to dispose of it.\n\u25aaAny real or perceived negative absolute or relative performance. Sales and redemptions of our investment strategies can be affected by investment performance relative to other competing investment strategies or to established benchmarks. Our investment management strategies are rated, ranked or assessed by independent third-parties, distribution partners and industry periodicals and services. These assessments often influence the investment decisions of clients. If the performance or assessment of our investment strategies is seen as underperforming relative to peers, it could result in an increase in the withdrawal of assets by existing clients and the inability to attract additional investments from existing and new clients. Certain of our investment strategies have capacity constraints, as there is a limit to the number of securities\navailable for the strategy to operate effectively. In those instances, we may choose to limit access to new or existing investors.\n\u25aaChanges in interest rates. Increases in interest rates from their historically low levels may adversely affect the net asset values of our assets under management. Furthermore, increases in interest rates may result in reduced prices in equity markets. Conversely, decreases in interest rates could lead to outflows in fixed income assets that we manage as investors seek higher yields.\nWe may engage in significant strategic transactions that may not achieve the expected benefits or could expose us to additional or increased risks.\nWe regularly review, and from time to time have discussions on and engage in, potential significant transactions, including acquisitions, consolidations, joint ventures, strategic partnerships, or similar transactions, some of which may be material. We cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in negotiation of the required agreements, closing transactions after signing such agreements, or achieving expected financial benefits, including such things as revenue or cost synergies.\nAny strategic transaction may also involve a number of other risks, including additional demands on our staff, unanticipated problems regarding integration of operating facilities, technologies and new employees, and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to, or otherwise unknown by, us prior to closing a transaction. In addition, any business we acquire may underperform relative to expectations or may lose customers or employees.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated global economic disruption and uncertainty.\nOur results of operations are affected by certain economic factors, including the condition of the securities markets. The global financial markets, including the capital, equity and credit markets, have been challenged in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic and its related economic impact. Although there are effective vaccines for COVID-19 that have been approved for use, distribution of the vaccines did not begin until late 2020, and a majority of the public will likely not have access to a vaccination until sometime in 2021. In addition, new strains of the virus appear to have increased transmissibility, which could complicate treatment and vaccination programs. Accordingly, the broader implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations and overall financial performance remain uncertain and, to the extent the financial markets experience challenges, we may suffer declines in our assets under management, which will adversely affect our revenues and earnings, and the fair value of our investments. Although we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to effectively continue operations for the foreseeable future, deterioration of worldwide credit and financial markets may limit our ability to raise capital and financing may not be available to us in sufficient amounts, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to access sufficient capital on acceptable terms, our business could be adversely impacted.\nIn an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we implemented various measures to reduce the impact of COVID-19 across our organization, while also maintaining business continuity. Consistent with government guidelines and mandates, these initiatives included the adoption of social distancing policies, work-at-home arrangements, and suspending employee travel. Currently, the majority of our employees are working remotely from home in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus and maintain the health and safety of our employees. While our work from home efforts have been successful to date, operating remotely for an extended period could result in operational challenges, strain our technology resources and/or expose us to an increased number of cybersecurity threats. A decline in the health and safety of our employees, including key employees, or material disruptions to their ability to work remotely, including power or Internet outages or electronic systems failures, could negatively affect our ability to operate our business normally and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nAdditionally, many of the key service providers and vendors upon which we rely also have transitioned to remote work environments pursuant to business continuity plans. While, to date, the effects of COVID-19 have not had a material negative impact on the services they provide to us, or, we believe, their business operations or service levels, to the extent that the COVID-19 virus continues to spread and affect the employee base or operations of our service providers, disruptions in or the inability to provide services to us could negatively impact our business operations.\nOur investment advisory agreements are subject to renegotiation or termination on short notice, which could negatively impact our business.\nOur clients include our sponsored mutual fund investors, that are represented by boards of directors, managed account program sponsors, private clients and institutional clients. Our investment management agreements with these clients may be terminated on short notice and without penalty. As a result, there would be little impediment for these clients or sponsors to terminate our agreements. Our clients may renegotiate their investment contracts, or reduce the assets we manage for them, due to a number of reasons including, but not limited to: poor investment performance; loss of key investment personnel; a change in the client's or third-party distributors decision makers; and reputational, regulatory or compliance issues. The board of directors of our sponsored funds may deem it to be in the best interests of a fund's shareholders to make decisions adverse to us, such as reducing the compensation paid to us, requesting that we subsidize fund expenses over certain thresholds, or imposing restrictions on our management of the fund. Under the Investment Company Act, investment advisory agreements automatically terminate in the event of an assignment, which may occur if, among other events, the Company undergoes a change in control, such as any person acquiring 25% of the voting rights of our common stock. If an assignment were to occur, we cannot be certain that the funds' board of directors and shareholders would approve a new investment advisory agreement. In addition, investment advisory agreements for separate accounts we manage may not be assigned without the consent of the client. If an assignment occurs, we cannot be certain that the Company will be able to obtain the necessary approvals or client consents. The withdrawal, renegotiation or termination of any investment management contract relating to a material portion of assets under management would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be harmed by any damage to our reputation and lead to a reduction in our revenues and profitability.\nMaintaining a positive reputation with existing and potential clients, the investment community and other constituencies is critical to our success. Our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate even if they are without merit or satisfactorily addressed. Our reputation may be impacted by many factors including, but not limited to, poor performance; litigation; conflicts of interests; regulatory inquiries, investigations or findings; operational failures (including cyber breaches); intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of our products or services by us or our third party service providers; material weaknesses in our internal controls; or employee misconduct or rumors. Any damage to our reputation could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel, adversely impact relationships with clients, third-party distributors and other business partners, and lead to a reduction in the amount of our assets under management, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur debt agreements contain covenants, required principal repayments and other provisions that could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations\nWe incur indebtedness for a variety of business reasons, including in relation to financing acquisitions. The indebtedness we incur can take many forms including, but not limited to, term loans or revolving lines of credit that customarily contain covenants.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Company had $205.7 million of total debt outstanding under its credit agreement, excluding debt of consolidated investment products (\"CIP\"), and had no borrowings outstanding under its $100.0 million credit facility. Under our credit agreement, we are required to use a portion of our cash flow to service interest and make required annual principal payments, which will restrict our cash flow available to pursue business growth opportunities. The credit agreement also contains covenants that limit our ability to return capital to shareholders. In addition, our indebtedness may make it more difficult for us to withstand or respond to adverse or changing business, regulatory and economic conditions. We cannot provide assurances that at all times in the future we will satisfy all such covenants or obtain any required waiver or amendment, in which event all indebtedness could become immediately due. Any or all of the above factors could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations.\nOur business relies on the ability to attract and retain key employees, and the loss of such employees could negatively affect our financial performance.\nThe success of our business is dependent to a large extent on our ability to attract and retain key employees, such as senior executives, portfolio managers, securities analysts and sales personnel. Competition in the job market for these professionals is generally intense, and compensation levels in the industry are highly competitive. Our industry is also characterized by the movement of investment professionals among different firms.\nIf we are unable to continue to attract and retain key employees, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain key employees increase, our performance, including our competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, we utilize Company equity awards as part of our compensation plans and as a means for recruiting and retaining key employees. Declines in our stock price could result in deterioration of the value of equity awards granted, thus lessening the effectiveness of using stock-based awards to retain key employees.\nIn certain circumstances, the departure of key investment personnel could cause higher redemption rates in certain strategies or the loss of certain client accounts. Any inability to retain key employees, attract qualified employees or replace key employees in a timely manner could lead to a reduction in the amount of our assets under management, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability. In addition, there could be additional costs to replace, retain or attract new talent that could result in a decrease in our profitability and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry that may require us to reduce our fees, or increase amounts paid to financial intermediaries, which could result in a reduction of our revenues and profitability.\nWe face significant competition from a wide variety of financial institutions, including other investment management companies, as well as from proprietary products offered by our distribution partners such as banks, broker-dealers and financial planning firms. Competition in our businesses is based on several factors, including investment performance, fees charged, access to distribution channels and service to financial advisers. Our competitors, many of which are larger than we are, often offer similar products, use the same distribution sources, offer less expensive products, maintain greater access to key distribution channels, and have greater resources, geographic footprints and name recognition than we do. Additionally, certain products and asset classes that we do not currently offer, such as passive or index-based products, are popular with investors. Existing clients may withdraw their assets in order to invest in these products, and we may be unable to attract additional investments from existing and new clients, which would lead to a decline in our assets under management and market share.\nOur profits are highly dependent on the fees charged for our products and services. In recent years, there has been a trend in certain segments of our markets toward lower fees and lower-fee products, such as passive products. Competition could cause us to reduce the fees that we charge. In order to maintain appropriate fee levels in a competitive environment, we must provide clients with investment products and services they view as appropriate in relation to the fees charged. If our clients, including our fund boards, were to view our fees as being high relative to the market or the returns provided by our investment products, we may choose, or be required to, reduce our fee levels or we may experience significant redemptions in our assets under management, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe utilize unaffiliated firms to provide investment management services, and any matters that adversely impact them, or any change in our relationships with them, could lead to a reduction in assets under management, which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe utilize unaffiliated subadvisers as investment managers for certain of our retail products, and we have licensing arrangements with unaffiliated data providers. Because we typically have no ownership interests in these unaffiliated firms, we do not control their business activities. Problems stemming from the business activities of these unaffiliated firms may negatively impact or disrupt their operations or expose them to disciplinary action or reputational harm. Furthermore, any such matters at these unaffiliated firms may have an adverse impact on our business or reputation or expose us to regulatory scrutiny, including with respect to our oversight of such firms.\nWe periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and we cannot provide assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or the unaffiliated firms. These relationships can also be terminated upon short notice without penalty. In addition, the departure of key employees at unaffiliated subadvisers firms could cause higher redemption rates for certain assets under management and/or the loss of certain client accounts. An interruption or termination of unaffiliated firm relationships could affect our ability to market our products and result in a reduction in assets under management, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe distribute our products through intermediaries and changes in key distribution relationships could reduce our revenues, increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability.\nOur primary source of distribution for retail products is through intermediaries that include third-party financial institutions, such as: major wire-houses; national, regional and independent broker-dealers and financial advisors; banks and\nfinancial planners; and registered investment advisers. Our success is highly dependent on access to these various distribution systems. These distributors are generally not contractually required to distribute our products and typically offer their clients various investment products and services, including proprietary products and services, in addition to, and in competition with, our products and services. While we compensate these intermediaries for selling our products and services pursuant to contractual agreements, we may not be able to retain access to these channels at all or at similar pricing. Increasing competition for these distribution channels could cause our distribution costs to rise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues and profitability. To the extent that existing or future intermediaries prefer to do business with our competitors, the sales of our products as well as our market share, revenues and profitability could decline.\nWe and our third-party service providers rely on numerous technology systems, and any temporary business interruption, security breach or system failure could negatively impact our business and profitability.\nOur technology systems, and those of third-party service providers, are critical to our operations. The ability to consistently and reliably obtain accurate securities pricing information, process client portfolio and fund shareholder transactions, and provide reports and other customer service to fund shareholders and clients in other accounts managed by us is an essential part of our business. Any delays or inaccuracies in obtaining pricing information, processing such transactions or reports, other breaches and errors, and any inadequacies in other customer service could result in reimbursement obligations or other liabilities or alienate customers and potentially give rise to claims against us. Our customer service capability, as well as our ability to obtain prompt and accurate securities pricing information and to process transactions and reports, is highly dependent on third-party service providers' information systems. Any failure or interruption of those systems, whether resulting from technology or infrastructure breakdowns, defects or external causes such as fire, natural disaster, computer viruses, acts of terrorism or power disruptions, could result in financial loss, negatively impact our reputation and negatively affect our ability to do business. Although we, and our third-party service providers, have disaster recovery plans in place, we may nonetheless experience interruptions if a natural or man-made disaster or prolonged power outage were to occur, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, like other companies, our computer systems are regularly subject to, and expected to continue to be the target of, computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other computer-related penetrations. The sophistication of cyber threats continues to increase, and any controls we put in place and preventative actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information systems may be insufficient to detect or prevent unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems or those of third parties with whom we do business. A breach of our technology systems, or of those of third parties with whom we do business, through cyber-attacks or failure to manage and secure our technology environment could result in interruptions or malfunctions in the operations of our business, loss of valuable information, liability for stolen assets or information, remediation costs to repair damage caused by a breach or to recover access to our systems, additional costs to mitigate against future incidents, and litigation costs resulting from an incident.\nWe and certain of our third-party vendors receive and store personal information as well as non-public business information. Although we and our third-party vendors take precautions, we may still be vulnerable to hacking or other unauthorized use. A breach of the systems or hardware could result in unauthorized access to our proprietary business or client data or release of this type of data, which could subject us to legal liability or regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws, which may result in fines or penalties, the termination of existing client contracts, costly mitigation activities and harm to our reputation. The occurrence of any of these risk could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have significant Company assets invested in marketable securities, which exposes us to earnings volatility as the value of these investments fluctuate, as well as risk of capital loss.\nWe use capital to incubate new investment strategies and make investments to introduce new products or enhance distribution access of existing products. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $135.4 million of such investments, comprising $36.2 million of marketable securities and $99.2 million of net interests in CIP. The Company also had $65.3 million of net investments in CLOs. These investments are in a variety of asset classes, including alternative, fixed income and equity strategies including first loss tranches of CLO equity. Many of these investments employ a long-term investment strategy and entail an optimal investment period spanning several years. Accordingly, during this investment period, the Company's capital utilized in these investments may not be available for other corporate purposes, or if required for alternative corporate purposes without significantly diminishing our invested capital or our investment return. We cannot provide assurance that these investments will perform as expected. Moreover, increases or decreases in the value of these investments\nwill increase the volatility of our earnings, and an other than temporary or permanent decline in the value of these investments would result in the loss of capital and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may need to obtain additional capital in the future that may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, which could have an adverse impact on our business.\nOur ability to meet our future cash needs is dependent upon our ability to generate cash. Although we have generated sufficient cash in the past, we may not do so in the future. The Company also had $100.0 million of unused capacity under our credit facility. Also at December 31, 2020, we had $205.7 million in debt outstanding, excluding the notes payable of our CIP for which risk of loss to the Company is limited to our $65.3 million investment in such products. See Note 19 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the notes payable of the CIP. Our ability to access capital markets efficiently depends on a number of factors, including the state of credit and equity markets, interest rates and credit spreads. We may need to raise capital to fund new business initiatives in the future, and financing may not be available to us in sufficient amounts, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to access sufficient capital on acceptable terms, our business could be adversely impacted.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nWe are subject to an extensive and complex regulatory environment, and changes in regulations or failure to comply with them could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nThe investment management industry in which we operate is subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation. We are regulated by the SEC under the Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, and we are subject to regulation by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission under the Commodities Exchange Act. The Central Bank of Ireland regulates our global funds (UCITS) and has approved the Company entities that advise these funds. We are also regulated by FINRA, the Department of Labor under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\"ERISA\"), as well as other federal and state laws and regulations.\nAlthough we spend extensive time and resources to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, if we fail to properly modify and update our compliance procedures in a timely manner in this changing and highly complex regulatory environment, we may be subject to various legal proceedings, including civil litigation, governmental investigations and enforcement actions that could result in fines, penalties, suspensions of individual employees, or limitations on particular business activities, any of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe manage assets under agreements that have investment guidelines or other contractual requirements and failure to comply could result in claims, losses or regulatory sanctions, which could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.\nThe agreements under which we manage client assets often have established investment guidelines or other contractual requirements with which we are required to comply in providing our investment management services. Although we maintain various compliance procedures and other controls to prevent, detect and correct such errors, any failure or allegation of a failure to comply with these guidelines or other requirement could result in client claims, reputational damage, withdrawal of assets and potential regulatory sanctions, any of which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could be subject to civil litigation and government investigations or proceedings, which could adversely affect our business.\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability, and there have been substantial incidences of litigation and regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years, including customer claims as well as class action suits seeking substantial damages. From time to time, we and/or our funds may be named as defendants or co-defendants in lawsuits or be involved in disputes that involve the threat of lawsuits seeking substantial damages. We and/or our funds are also involved from time to time in governmental and self-regulatory organization investigations and proceedings. See Item 3. \"Legal Proceedings\" for further description of the Company's litigation matters.\nAny lawsuits, investigations or proceedings could result in reputational damage, loss of clients and assets, settlements, awards, injunctions, fines, penalties, increased costs and expenses in resolving a claim, diversion of employee resources and resultant financial losses. Predicting the outcome of such matters is inherently difficult, particularly where claims are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants or by a large number of claimants, when claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages, or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early stage. A substantial judgment, settlement, fine or penalty\ncould be material to our operating results or cash flows for a particular period, depending on our results for that period, or could cause us significant reputational harm, which could harm our business prospects.\nWe depend to a large extent on our business relationships and our reputation to attract and retain clients. As a result, allegations of improper conduct by private litigants, including investors in our funds, or regulators, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us, our investment activities or the asset management industry in general, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, which may be more damaging to our business than to other types of businesses. We may incur substantial legal expenses in defending against proceedings commenced by a client, regulatory authority or other private litigant. Substantial legal liability levied on us could cause significant reputational harm and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to multiple tax jurisdictions and any changes in tax laws or unanticipated tax obligations could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe are subject to income taxes as well as non-income-based taxes, and are subject to ongoing tax audits, in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken which may result in the assessment of additional taxes. We regularly assess the appropriateness of our tax positions and reporting. We cannot provide assurance, however, that we will accurately predict the outcomes of audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could be unfavorable. Any changes to tax laws could impact our estimated effective tax rate and overall tax expense and could result in adjustments to our treatment of deferred taxes, including the realization or value thereof, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes available to us will be dependent on our ability to generate taxable income.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nWe have a large amount of our common stock concentrated with a small number of shareholders, which could increase the volatility in our stock trading and affect our share price.\nA large percentage of our common stock is held by a limited number of shareholders. If our larger shareholders decide to liquidate their positions, it could cause significant fluctuation in the share price of our common stock. Public companies with a relatively concentrated level of institutional shareholders, such as we have, often have difficulty generating trading volume in their stock, which may increase the volatility in the price of our common stock.\nWe may not pay quarterly dividends as intended or at all.\nThe declaration, payment and determination of the amount of our quarterly dividends may change at any time. In making decisions regarding our quarterly dividends, we consider general economic and business conditions as well as our strategic plans and prospects, business and investment opportunities, financial condition and operating results, working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs, contractual and regulatory restrictions (including under the terms of our credit agreement) and other obligations, that may have implications on the payment of distributions by us to our shareholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and such other factors as we may deem relevant. Our ability to pay dividends in excess of our current quarterly dividends is subject to restrictions under the terms of our credit agreement. We cannot make any assurances that any dividends whether quarterly or otherwise will continue to be paid in the future.\nWe have corporate governance provisions that may make an acquisition of us more difficult.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. In addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law also restrict certain business combinations with interested stockholders.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nOur insurance policies may not cover all losses and costs to which we may be exposed.\nWe carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate. Our insurance may not cover all liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed. Certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in\nfuture periods. As our insurance policies come up for renewal, we may need to assume higher deductibles or pay higher premiums, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have goodwill and intangible assets on our balance sheet that could become impaired.\nOur goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews. We also have definite-lived intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing if indicators of impairment are identified. A variety of factors could cause the carrying values to become impaired, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nSPECIAL NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statements that are, or may be considered to be, forward-looking statements within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\").
