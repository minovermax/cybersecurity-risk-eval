RISK FACTORS.\nWe have described many of the trends and other factors that we believe could impact our business and future results in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Report. In addition, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to, and could be materially adversely affected by, various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or our anticipated future results.\nWe depend on U.S. Government customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of these relationships, a reduction in U.S. Government funding or a change in U.S. Government spending priorities could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are highly dependent on sales to U.S. Government customers. The percentage of our revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including the DoD and intelligence and civilian agencies, as well as foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 64 percent in fiscal 2015, 67 percent in fiscal 2014 and 67 percent in fiscal 2013. Therefore, any significant disruption or deterioration of our relationship with the U.S. Government would significantly reduce our revenue. Our competitors continuously engage in efforts to expand their business relationships with the U.S. Government and will continue these efforts in the future, and the U.S. Government may choose to use other contractors. We expect that a majority of the business that we seek will be awarded through competitive bidding. The U.S. Government has increasingly relied on certain types of contracts that are subject to multiple competitive bidding processes, including multi-vendor IDIQ, GWAC, General Services Administration Schedule and other multi-award contracts, which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure. We operate in highly competitive markets and our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas, and we may not be able to continue to win competitively awarded contracts or to obtain task orders under multi-award contracts. Further, the competitive bidding process involves significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or may be split among competitors, as well as the risk that we may fail to accurately estimate the resources and costs required to fulfill any contract awarded to us. Following any contract award, we may experience significant expense or delay, contract modification or contract rescission as a result of our competitors protesting or challenging contracts awarded to us in competitive bidding. The current competitive environment has resulted in unsuccessful bidders more frequently initiating bid protests and, in some cases, the bid protest has resulted in a portion of the work subject to the bid being awarded to the bid protester in exchange for withdrawing the bid protest. Our U.S. Government programs must compete with programs managed by other government contractors and with other policy imperatives for consideration for limited resources and for uncertain levels of funding during the budget and appropriation process. Budget and appropriations decisions made by the U.S. Government are outside of our control and have long-term consequences for our business. U.S. Government spending priorities and levels remain uncertain and difficult to predict and are affected by numerous factors, including sequestration (automatic, across-the-board U.S. Government budgetary spending cuts) and potential alternative funding arrangements. A change in U.S. Government spending priorities or an increase in non-procurement spending at the expense of our programs, or a reduction in total U.S. Government spending, could have material adverse consequences on our future business. For more information regarding sequestration, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Considerations - Industry-Wide Opportunities, Challenges and Risks\u201d of this Report.\nWe depend significantly on U.S. Government contracts, which often are only partially funded, subject to immediate termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The termination or failure to fund, or negative audit findings for, one or more of these contracts could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOver its lifetime, a U.S. Government program may be implemented by the award of many different individual contracts and subcontracts. The funding of U.S. Government programs is subject to Congressional appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized and appropriated in connection with major procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis. Procurement funds are typically made available for obligation over the course of one to three years. Consequently, programs often receive only partial funding initially, and additional funds are obligated only as Congress authorizes further appropriations. The termination of funding for a U.S. Government program would result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program, which could have an adverse impact on our operations. In addition, the termination of a program or the failure to commit additional funds to a program that already has been started could result in lost revenue and increase our overall costs of doing business.\nGenerally, U.S. Government contracts are subject to oversight audits by U.S. Government representatives. Such audits could result in adjustments to our contract costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. We have recorded contract revenue based on costs we expect to realize upon final audit. However, we do not know the outcome of any future audits and adjustments, and we may be required to materially reduce our revenue or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.\nIn addition, U.S. Government contracts generally contain provisions permitting termination, in whole or in part, without prior notice at the U.S. Government\u2019s convenience upon the payment only for work done and commitments made at the time of termination. We can give no assurance that one or more of our U.S. Government contracts will not be terminated under these circumstances. Also, we can give no assurance that we would be able to procure new contracts to offset the revenue or backlog lost as a result of any termination of our U.S. Government contracts. Because a significant portion of our revenue is dependent on our performance and payment under our U.S. Government contracts, the loss of one or more large contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur government business also is subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of socioeconomic and other requirements. These requirements, although customary in U.S. Government contracts, increase our performance and compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future, thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could lead to fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory or treble damages, or suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for debarment are violations of various laws, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, U.S. Government security regulations, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper recording of costs and foreign corruption. The termination of a U.S. Government contract or relationship as a result of any of these acts would have an adverse impact on our operations and could have an adverse effect on our standing and eligibility for future U.S. Government contracts.\nWe could be negatively impacted by a security breach, through cyber attack, cyber intrusion or otherwise, or other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems or of those we operate for certain of our customers.\nWe face the risk, as does any company, of a security breach, whether through cyber attack or cyber intrusion over the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization, or other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems. We face an added risk of a security breach or other significant disruption of the IT networks and related systems that we develop, install, operate and maintain for certain of our customers, which may involve managing and protecting information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions or personally identifiable or protected health information. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. As a communications and IT company, and particularly as a government contractor, we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from threats to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers\u2019 proprietary or classified information on our IT networks and related systems and to the IT networks and related systems that we operate and maintain for certain of our customers. These types of information and IT networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers. Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and IT networks and related systems, and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. In some cases, the resources of foreign governments may be behind such attacks due to the nature of our business and the industries in which we operate. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. A security breach or other significant disruption involving these types of information and IT networks and related systems could:\n\u2022\nDisrupt the proper functioning of these networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers;\n\u2022\nResult in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including trade secrets, which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;\n\u2022\nCompromise national security and other sensitive government functions;\n\u2022\nRequire significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result;\n\u2022\nSubject us to claims for contract breach, damages, credits, penalties or termination; and\n\u2022\nDamage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of the U.S. Government) and the public generally.\nAny or all of the foregoing could have a negative impact on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe level of returns on defined benefit plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors could affect our earnings and cash flows in future periods.\nA substantial portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by defined benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans (collectively, \u201cdefined benefit plans\u201d), as a result of our acquisition of Exelis. We may experience significant fluctuations in costs related to defined benefit plans as a result of macro-economic factors, such as interest rates, that are beyond our control. The cost of our defined benefit plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves various factors and uncertainties during those periods which can be volatile and unpredictable, including the rates of return on defined benefit plan assets, discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses, mortality of plan participants and trends for future medical costs. Management develops each assumption using relevant plan and experience and expectations in conjunction with market-related data. Our financial position and results of operations could be materially affected by significant changes in key economic indicators, financial market volatility, future legislation and other governmental regulatory actions.\nWe will make contributions to fund our defined benefit plans when considered necessary or advantageous to do so. The macro-economic factors discussed above, including the rates of return on defined benefit plan assets and the minimum funding requirements established by government funding or taxing authorities, or established by other agreement, may influence future funding requirements. A significant decline in the fair value of our plan assets, or other adverse changes to our overall defined benefit plans, could require us to make significant funding contributions and affect cash flows in future periods.\nU.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards govern the extent to which postretirement costs and plan contributions are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government. As a result, we expect to continue to seek reimbursement from the U.S. Government for a portion of our postretirement costs and plan contributions.\nOn December 27, 2011 the U.S. Government\u2019s Cost Accounting Standards Board published a final rule that harmonizes Cost Accounting Standards (\u201cCAS\u201d) pension cost reimbursement rules with the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (\u201cPPA\u201d) funding requirements. The rule is expected to eventually mitigate the mismatch between CAS costs and PPA-amended ERISA minimum funding requirements, and result in an acceleration of allowable CAS pension costs as compared to the prior rules. The final rule applied to Exelis\u2019 contracts starting in 2013, although due to a five-year phase in, the full phase-in will not be not achieved until 2017. We anticipate that government contractors will be entitled to an equitable adjustment for any additional CAS contract costs resulting from the final rule.\nWe enter into fixed-price contracts that could subject us to losses in the event of cost overruns or a significant increase in inflation.\nWe have a number of fixed-price contracts, which allow us to benefit from cost savings, but subject us to the risk of potential cost overruns, particularly for firm fixed-price contracts because we assume all of the cost burden. If our initial estimates are incorrect, we can lose money on these contracts. U.S. Government contracts can expose us to potentially large losses because the U.S. Government can hold us responsible for completing a project or, in certain circumstances, paying the entire cost of its replacement by another provider regardless of the size or foreseeability of any cost overruns that occur over the life of the contract. Because many of these contracts involve new technologies and applications and can last for years, unforeseen events, such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials, problems with our suppliers and cost overruns, can result in the contractual price becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us over time. The U.S. and other countries also may experience a significant increase in inflation. A significant increase in inflation rates could have a significant adverse impact on the profitability of these contracts. Furthermore, if we do not meet contract deadlines or specifications, we may need to renegotiate contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer exercises its right to terminate. In addition, some of our contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights, and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts we may not realize their full benefits. Our results of operations are dependent on our ability to maximize our earnings from our contracts. Cost overruns could have an adverse impact on our financial results. The potential impact of such risk on our financial results would increase if the mix of our contracts and programs shifted toward a greater percentage of fixed-price contracts, particularly firm fixed-price contracts.\nWe use estimates in accounting for many of our programs and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results.\nAccounting for our contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks, including risks associated with customer directed delays and reductions in scheduled deliveries, unfavorable resolutions of claims and contractual matters, judgments associated with estimating contract revenue and costs, and assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, we must make assumptions regarding: (i) the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials; (ii) whether the intent of entering into multiple contracts was effectively to enter into a single project in order to determine whether such contracts should be combined or segmented; (iii) incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts in estimating revenue and profit rates, and record them when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance; and (iv) estimates of award fees in estimating revenue and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes involved in accounting for our contracts, materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nWe are dependent on sales to customers outside the U.S. The percentage of our total revenue represented by revenue from products and services exported from the U.S., including foreign military sales, or manufactured or rendered abroad was 31 percent in fiscal 2015, 30 percent in fiscal 2014 and 26 percent in fiscal 2013. Approximately 27 percent of our international business in fiscal 2015 was transacted in local currency. Losses resulting from currency rate fluctuations can adversely affect our results. We expect that international revenue will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue. Also, a significant portion of our international revenue is from, and an increasing portion of our business activity is being conducted in, less-developed countries and sometimes in countries with unstable governments, in areas of military conflict or at military installations. We are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022\nCurrency exchange controls, fluctuations of currency and currency revaluations;\n\u2022\nThe laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments relating to investments and operations, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d);\n\u2022\nChanges in regulatory requirements, including business or operating license requirements, imposition of tariffs or embargoes, export controls and other trade restrictions;\n\u2022\nUncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding, credit or guarantees;\n\u2022\nThe complexity and necessity of using, and disruptions involving our, international dealers, distributors, sales representatives and consultants;\n\u2022\nThe difficulties of managing a geographically dispersed organization and culturally diverse workforces, including compliance with local laws and practices;\n\u2022\nDifficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner and changes in tax laws;\n\u2022\nImport and export licensing requirements and regulations, as well as unforeseen changes in export regulations;\n\u2022\nUncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and occasional requirements for onerous contract clauses;\n\u2022\nRapid changes in government, economic and political policies, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation; and\n\u2022\nIncreased risk of an incident resulting in damage or destruction to our products or resulting in injury or loss of life to our employees, subcontractors or other third parties.\nOur reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of our employees, agents or business partners.\nWe have implemented compliance controls, policies and procedures designed to prevent reckless or criminal acts from being committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws governing payments to government officials, such as the FCPA, and to detect any such reckless or criminal acts committed. We cannot ensure, however, that our controls, policies and procedures will prevent or detect all such reckless or criminal acts. If not prevented, such reckless or criminal acts could subject us to civil or criminal investigations and monetary and non-monetary penalties and could have a material adverse effect on\nour ability to conduct business, our results of operations and our reputation. In addition, misconduct involving data security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use of our customer\u2019s sensitive or classified information could result in remediation costs, regulatory sanctions against us and serious harm to our reputation.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct certain operations abroad, and Congress may prevent proposed sales to certain foreign governments.\nWe must first obtain export and other licenses and authorizations from various U.S. Government agencies before we are permitted to sell certain products and technologies outside of the U.S. For example, the U.S. Department of State must notify Congress at least 15 to 60 days, depending on the size and location of the proposed sale, prior to authorizing certain sales of defense equipment and services to foreign governments. During that time, Congress may take action to block the proposed sale. We can give no assurance that we will continue to be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses or authorizations or that Congress will not prevent or delay certain sales. Any significant impairment of our ability to sell products or technologies outside of the U.S. could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe continued effects of the general weakness in the global economy and the U.S. Government\u2019s budget deficits and national debt and sequestration could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDespite some positive trends in the U.S. economy, the economies of the U.S. and many foreign countries in which we do business continue to show weakness or limited improvement. We are unable to predict the impact, severity and duration of these economic events. The continued effects of these economic events and the U.S. Government\u2019s budget deficits and national debt and sequestration could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in a number of ways. Possible effects of these economic conditions include the following:\n\u2022\nThe U.S. Government could reduce or delay its spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, the government programs in which we participate;\n\u2022\nThe U.S. Government may be unable to complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year on September 30 and thus would be required either to shut down or be funded pursuant to a \u201ccontinuing resolution\u201d that authorizes agencies of the U.S. Government to continue operations but does not authorize new spending initiatives, either of which could result in reduced or delayed orders or payments for products and services we provide. If the U.S. Government budget process results in a shutdown or prolonged operation under a continuing resolution, it may decrease our revenue, profitability or cash flows or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022\nU.S. Government spending could be impacted by sequestration or alternate arrangements, which increases the uncertainty as to, and the difficulty in predicting, U.S. Government spending priorities and levels;\n\u2022\nWe may experience declines in revenue, profitability and cash flows as a result of reduced or delayed orders or payments or other factors caused by the economic problems of our customers and prospective customers, including U.S. Federal, state and local governments;\n\u2022\nWe may experience supply chain delays, disruptions or other problems associated with financial constraints faced by our suppliers and subcontractors; and\n\u2022\nWe may incur increased costs or experience difficulty with future borrowings under our commercial paper program or credit facilities or in the debt markets, or otherwise with financing our operating, investing (including any future acquisitions) or financing activities.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to develop new products, systems, services and technologies that achieve market acceptance in our current and future markets.\nBoth our commercial and government businesses are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our performance depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nIdentify emerging technological trends in our current and target markets;\n\u2022\nDevelop and maintain competitive products, systems, services and technologies;\n\u2022\nEnhance our offerings by adding innovative hardware, software or other features that differentiate our products, systems, services and technologies from those of our competitors; and\n\u2022\nDevelop, manufacture and bring to market cost-effective offerings quickly.\nWe believe that, in order to remain competitive in the future, we will need to continue to develop new products, systems, services and technologies, requiring the investment of significant financial resources. The need to make these expenditures could divert our attention and resources from other projects, and we cannot be sure that these\nexpenditures ultimately will lead to the timely development of new products, systems, services or technologies. Due to the design complexity of some of our products, systems, services and technologies, we may experience delays in completing development and introducing new products, systems, services or technologies in the future. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or redirect resources from other projects. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our products, systems, services or technologies will develop as we currently anticipate. The failure of our products, systems, services or technologies to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our revenue and harm our business. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products, systems, services or technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of our products, systems, services or technologies, or that our competitors will not develop new products, systems, services or technologies that cause our existing products, systems, services or technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The future direction of the domestic and global economies, including its impact on customer demand, also will have a significant impact on our overall performance.\nWe participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth in our markets and, as a result, future income and expenditures.\nWe participate in U.S. and international markets that are subject to uncertain economic conditions. In particular, U.S. Government spending priorities and levels remain uncertain and difficult to predict and are affected by numerous factors, including sequestration and potential alternative funding arrangements. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth in the markets in which we participate. Because all components of our budgeting and forecasting are dependent on estimates of growth in the markets we serve, the uncertainty renders estimates of or guidance relating to future revenue, income and expenditures even more difficult. As a result, we may make significant investments and expenditures but never realize the anticipated benefits.\nWe cannot predict the consequences of future geo-political events, but they may adversely affect the markets in which we operate, our ability to insure against risks, our operations or our profitability.\nOngoing instability and current conflicts in global markets, including in the Middle East and Asia, and the potential for other conflicts and future terrorist activities and other recent geo-political events throughout the world have created economic and political uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and profitability. These matters cause uncertainty in the world\u2019s financial and insurance markets and may significantly increase the political, economic and social instability in the geographic areas in which we operate. These matters also may cause our insurance coverages and performance bonds to increase in cost, or in some cases, to be unavailable altogether.\nWe have made, and may continue to make, strategic acquisitions and divestitures that involve significant risks and uncertainties.\nStrategic acquisitions and divestitures that we have made in the past, and may continue to make, present significant risks and uncertainties, which include:\n\u2022\nDifficulty in identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions, including the risk that our due diligence does not identify or fully assess valuation issues, potential liabilities or other acquisition risks;\n\u2022\nDifficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations, including combining product and service offerings, and in entering into new markets in which we are not experienced, in an efficient and cost-effective manner while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures, and the risk that we encounter significant unanticipated costs or other problems associated with integration;\n\u2022\nDifficulty in consolidating and rationalizing IT infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code;\n\u2022\nChallenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits expected from acquisitions;\n\u2022\nRisk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the strategic acquisitions and divestitures do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets;\n\u2022\nRisk that we assume significant liabilities that exceed the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of any indemnifying parties;\n\u2022\nPotential loss of key employees or customers of the businesses acquired or to be divested;\n\u2022\nRisk that we are not able to complete strategic divestitures on satisfactory terms and conditions or within expected timeframes; and\n\u2022\nRisk of diverting the attention of senior management from our existing operations.\nDisputes with our subcontractors and the inability of our subcontractors to perform, or our key suppliers to timely deliver our components, parts or services, could cause our products or services to be produced or delivered in an untimely or unsatisfactory manner.\nWe engage subcontractors on many of our contracts. We may have disputes with our subcontractors, including regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontract, our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract, our hiring of the personnel of a subcontractor or vice versa or the subcontractor\u2019s failure to comply with applicable law. In addition, there are certain parts, components and services for many of our products and services which we source from other manufacturers or vendors. Some of our suppliers, from time to time, experience financial and operational difficulties, which may impact their ability to supply the materials, components, subsystems and services that we require. Our supply chain could also be disrupted by external events, such as natural disasters or other significant disruptions (including extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, cyber attacks and labor disputes), governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes, including product certification or stewardship requirements, sourcing restrictions, product authenticity and climate change or greenhouse gas emission standards. Any inability to develop alternative sources of supply on a cost-effective and timely basis could materially impair our ability to manufacture and deliver products and services to our customers. We can give no assurances that we will be free from disputes with our subcontractors, material supply problems or component, subsystems or services problems in the future. Also, our subcontractors and other suppliers may not be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials, components, subsystems and services they supply, which might result in greater product returns, service problems and warranty claims and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, in connection with our government contracts, we are required to procure certain materials, components and parts from supply sources approved by the U.S. Government. There are currently several components for which there may be only one supplier. The inability of a sole source supplier to meet our needs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThird parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their intellectual property rights, and third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property rights.\nMany of the markets we serve are characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which often has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation. Third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing or to have infringed directly or indirectly upon those intellectual property rights. Claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products, services and solutions. Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. If we fail to successfully protect and enforce these rights, our competitive position could suffer. Our pending patent and trademark registration applications may not be allowed, or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents or trademark registrations. In addition, our patents may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to detect infringement and our competitive position may be harmed before we do so. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.\nThe outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are involved is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we are defendants in a number of litigation matters and are involved in a number of arbitrations. These actions may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. No assurances can be given that the results of these or new matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of lawsuits or arbitrations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be covered adequately by insurance or indemnity.\nWe are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. A significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced defense, technology and communications systems and products. New technologies associated with these systems and products may be untested or unproven. Components of certain of the defense systems and products we develop are inherently dangerous. Failures of satellites, missile systems, air traffic control systems, homeland security applications and aircraft have the potential to cause loss\nof life and extensive property damage. Other examples of unforeseen problems that could result, either directly or indirectly, in the loss of life or property or otherwise negatively affect revenue and profitability include loss on launch of spacecraft, premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement, problems with quality and workmanship, country of origin, delivery of subcontractor components or services and unplanned degradation of product performance. In addition, problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual requirements. In many circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. Government. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident or incident. It also is not possible for us to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. Substantial claims resulting from an incident in excess of U.S. Government indemnity and our insurance coverage would harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Other factors that may affect revenue and profits include loss of follow-on work, and, in the case of certain contracts, liquidated damages, penalties and repayment to the customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received. Moreover, any accident or incident for which we are liable, even if fully insured, could negatively affect our standing with our customers and the public, thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, and could significantly impact the cost and availability of adequate insurance in the future.\nChanges in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors including:\n\u2022\nThe jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u2022\nAdjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;\n\u2022\nIncreases in expenses not fully deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process research and development and impairment of goodwill or other long-term assets in connection with acquisitions;\n\u2022\nChanges in available tax credits;\n\u2022\nChanges in share-based compensation expense;\n\u2022\nChanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nChanges in domestic or international tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; and\n\u2022\nThe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities.\nAny significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods.\nOur level of indebtedness and our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness and our unfunded pension liability may adversely affect our financial and operating activities or our ability to incur additional debt.\nAt the end of fiscal 2015, we had $5.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt and approximately $2.0 billion of unfunded pension liability. In the future we may increase our borrowings; however, our ability to do so will be subject to limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness as well as any future debt that we may incur and our ability to make contributions to our unfunded pension liability, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due or make contributions to our unfunded pension liability, we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions, including (i) reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes or (ii) dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the defense technology industry could be impaired. The lenders who hold such debt could also accelerate amounts due, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of any of our other debt.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could change based on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, mergers, acquisitions or dispositions. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that any rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future. Moreover, these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any of our debt securities. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook, would likely increase our borrowing costs and affect our ability to incur new indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and could also have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and outstanding debt securities.\nUnforeseen environmental issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to and affected by many Federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations. In addition, we could be affected by future environmental laws or regulations, including, for example, new restrictions on materials used in our operations. Compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations may require significant operating and capital costs. Environmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations, and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges. We also incur, and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations related to remediation of conditions in the environment. In addition, if violations of environmental laws result in our, or in one or more of our facilities, being placed on the \u201cExcluded Parties List\u201d maintained by the General Services Administration, we could become ineligible to receive certain contracts, subcontracts and other benefits from the Federal government or to perform work under a government contract or subcontract at any listed facility. Generally, such ineligibility would continue until the basis for the listing has been appropriately addressed. Developments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, violations by us of such laws and regulations, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, litigation involving environmental impacts, our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments under previously priced contracts, or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have significant operations in locations that could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a natural disaster or other significant disruption.\nOur corporate headquarters and significant business operations are located in Florida and other significant business operations are located in Houston, Texas, which areas are subject to the risk of major hurricanes. Our worldwide operations and operations of our suppliers could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, cyber attacks and other natural and manmade disasters or disruptions. In the event of such a natural disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers or customers; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in the regulatory framework under which our managed satellite and terrestrial communications solutions operations are operated could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur domestic satellite and terrestrial communications solutions are currently provided on a private carrier basis and are therefore subject to a lesser degree of regulation by the Federal Communications Commission and other Federal, state and local agencies than if provided on a common carrier basis. Our international satellite and terrestrial communications solutions operations are regulated by governments of various countries other than the U.S. and by other international authorities. The regulatory regimes applicable to our international satellite and terrestrial communications solutions operations frequently require that we obtain and maintain licenses for our operations and conduct our operations in accordance with prescribed standards. Compliance with such requirements may inhibit our ability to quickly expand our operations into new countries, including in circumstances in which such expansion is required in order to provide uninterrupted service to existing customers with mobile operations as they move to new locations on short notice. Failure to comply with such regulatory requirements could subject us to various penalties or sanctions. The adoption of new laws or regulations, changes to the existing domestic or international regulatory framework, new interpretations of the laws that apply to our operations, or the loss of, or a material limitation on, any of our material licenses could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on third parties to provide satellite bandwidth for our managed satellite and terrestrial communications solutions, and any bandwidth constraints could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn our managed satellite and terrestrial communications solutions operations, we compete for satellite bandwidth with other commercial entities, such as other satellite communications services providers and broadcasting companies, and with governmental entities, such as the military. In certain markets and at certain times, satellite bandwidth may be limited and/or pricing of satellite bandwidth could be subject to competitive pressure. In such cases, we may be unable to secure sufficient bandwidth needed to provide our managed satellite communications services, either at favorable rates or at all. This inability could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in future business or other market conditions could cause business investments and/or recorded goodwill or other long-term assets to become impaired, resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs part of our overall strategy, we will, from time to time, acquire a minority or majority interest in a business. These investments are made upon careful analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price. After acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates. Goodwill accounted for approximately 48 percent of our recorded total assets as of July 3, 2015. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill annually, as well as when we change reportable segments and when events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reportable segment cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. Because of the significance of our goodwill and other intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For additional information on accounting policies we have in place for impairment of goodwill, see our discussion under \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Report and Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3: Discontinued Operations in the Notes.\nSome of our workforce is represented by labor unions, so our business could be harmed in the event of a prolonged work stoppage.\nApproximately 900 of our employees are unionized, which represents approximately 4% of our employee-base at the end of fiscal 2015. As a result, we may experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our union relationships will be or whether we will be able to successfully negotiate successor collective bargaining agreements without impacting our financial condition. In addition, the presence of unions may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Work stoppages could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe must attract and retain key employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.\nOur business has a continuing need to attract and retain significant numbers of skilled personnel, including personnel holding security clearances, to support our growth and to replace individuals whose employment has terminated due to retirement or for other reasons. To the extent that the demand for qualified personnel exceeds supply, as has been the case from time to time in recent years, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees, or could experience difficulties in performing under our contracts if our needs for such employees were unmet.\nRisks Relating to the Spin-off of Vectrus Completed by Exelis\nOn September 27, 2014, before being acquired by Harris, Exelis completed the spin-off of Vectrus. After the spin-off, Exelis and Vectrus operate independently of each other and neither company has an ownership interest in the other. Prior to the completion of the spin-off, Exelis and Vectrus entered into a Distribution Agreement and related separation agreements that provided mechanisms for an orderly separation and govern the post-separation relationship between Exelis and Vectrus. These agreements generally provide that each party is responsible for its respective assets, liabilities and obligations following the spin-off, including employee benefits, intellectual property, information technology, insurance and tax-related assets and liabilities. The agreements also set forth Exelis\u2019 future commitments to provide Vectrus with certain temporary transition services. The executed agreements include the Distribution Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Transition Services Agreement and several intellectual property agreements. The following are among the risks we face in connection with the spin-off of Vectrus completed by Exelis:\nWe may be responsible for U.S. Federal income tax liabilities that relate to the spin-off of Vectrus completed by Exelis.\nIn connection with the spin-off of Vectrus, completed by Exelis prior to our acquisition of Exelis, Exelis received an opinion of tax counsel substantially to the effect that, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, the spin-off will qualify for tax-free treatment under section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code. However, if the factual assumptions or representations made in the opinion are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business, we will not be able to rely on the opinion. Furthermore, the opinion will not be binding on the Internal Revenue Service the (\u201cIRS\u201d) or the courts. Accordingly, the IRS or the courts may challenge the conclusions stated in the opinion and such challenge could prevail. If, notwithstanding receipt of the opinion, the\nspin-off is determined to be taxable, we would be subject to a substantial tax liability. In addition, if the spin-off transaction is taxable, each holder of Exelis common stock who received shares of Vectrus in the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received, thereby potentially increasing such holder\u2019s tax liability. Even if the Vectrus spin-off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction, the distribution could be taxable to us (but not to our shareholders) in certain circumstances if subsequent significant acquisitions of Exelis stock or the stock of Vectrus are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Vectrus spin-off. In this event, the resulting tax liability could be substantial.\nIn connection with the Vectrus spin-off, Vectrus indemnified Exelis for certain liabilities and Exelis indemnified Vectrus for certain liabilities. This indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of the liabilities assumed by Vectrus and Vectrus may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations to us in the future.\nAs part of the Distribution Agreement, Exelis and Vectrus indemnified each other with respect to such parties\u2019 assumed or retained liabilities pursuant to the Distribution Agreement and breaches of the Distribution Agreement or related separation agreements. There can be no assurance that the indemnity from Vectrus will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these and other liabilities, or that Vectrus will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Third-parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Vectrus has agreed to assume. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Vectrus any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear those losses ourselves. In addition, performance on indemnities that Exelis provided Vectrus may be significant and could negatively impact our business. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Vectrus spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and Federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.\nThe Vectrus spin-off could be challenged under various state and Federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (such as a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy) could claim that Exelis did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the spin-off, and that the spin-off left Exelis insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that Exelis intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the spin-off as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, including, without limitation, returning assets or Vectrus shares to Exelis or providing Exelis with a claim for money damages against Vectrus in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by Exelis and the fair market value of Vectrus at the time of the spin-off.\nThe measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws may vary depending on which jurisdiction\u2019s law is applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including the probable amount of contingent liabilities), and such entity would be considered to have unreasonably small capital if it lacked adequate capital to conduct its business in the ordinary course and pay its liabilities as they become due. No assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that Exelis was solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the spin-off, including the distribution of Vectrus common stock.\nThe distribution by Exelis of the Vectrus common stock in the spin-off could also be challenged under state corporate distribution statutes. Under the Indiana Business Corporation Law, a corporation may not make distributions to its shareholders if, after giving effect to the distribution, (i) the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or (ii) the corporation\u2019s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities. No assurance can be given that a court will not later determine that the distribution by Exelis of Vectrus common stock in the spin-off was unlawful. Each of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to the Spin-off of Exelis from ITT Corporation\nIn 2011, ITT Corporation (\u201cITT\u201d) completed a transaction resulting in the spin-off of Exelis and Xylem, Inc. (\u201cXylem\u201d). After the spin-off, Exelis, ITT and Xylem operate independently of each other and none of the companies have any ownership interest in the other. In order to govern certain ongoing relationships between Exelis, ITT and Xylem following the spin-off and to provide mechanisms for an orderly transition, Exelis, ITT, and Xylem executed various agreements that govern the ongoing relationships between and among the three companies after the spin-off and provide for the allocation of employee benefits, income taxes, and certain other liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to the spin-off. The executed agreements include the Distribution Agreement, Benefits and Compensation Matters Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, several real estate matters agreements and Master Transition Services Agreement.\nThe Distribution Agreement provides for certain indemnifications and cross-indemnifications among Exelis, ITT and Xylem. The indemnifications address a variety of subjects, including indemnification by ITT of Exelis in respect of certain asserted and unasserted asbestos or silica liability claims. These indemnifications include claims relating to the presence or alleged presence of asbestos or silica in products manufactured, repaired or sold prior to the distribution date, subject to limited exceptions with respect to certain employee claims. These indemnifications also include claims relating to the presence or alleged presence of asbestos or silica in the structure or material of any building or facility, subject to exceptions with respect to employee claims relating to Exelis or Xylem buildings or facilities. The indemnifications are absolute and indefinite. The indemnification associated with pending and future asbestos and silica claims does not expire.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Exelis, ITT and Xylem after the spin-off with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. Federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. Exelis has joint and several liability with ITT and Xylem to the IRS for the consolidated U.S. Federal income taxes of the ITT consolidated group relating to the taxable periods in which Exelis was part of that group. However, the Tax Matters Agreement specifies the portion, if any, of this liability for which Exelis bears responsibility, and ITT and Xylem agree to indemnify Exelis against any amounts for which Exelis is not responsible. Though valid as between the parties, the Tax Matters Agreement is not binding on the IRS.\nThe following are among the risks we face in connection with Exelis\u2019 spin-off from ITT:\nThe ITT spin-off of Exelis may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and Federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.\nExelis spin-off from ITT could be challenged under various state and Federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (such as a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy) could claim that the ITT spin-off left Exelis, ITT and/or Xylem insolvent or with unreasonably small capital, or that Exelis, ITT and/or Xylem intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature and that ITT did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the ITT spin-off. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the ITT spin-off as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are required to indemnify ITT or Xylem in connection with the ITT spin-off of Exelis, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nPursuant to the Distribution Agreement entered into in connection with the ITT spin-off and certain other agreements among Exelis, ITT and Xylem, ITT and Xylem agreed to indemnify Exelis from certain liabilities, and Exelis agreed to indemnify ITT and Xylem for certain liabilities as discussed further above. Indemnities that we may be required to provide ITT and Xylem may be significant and could negatively impact our business. Further, there can be no assurance that the indemnity from ITT and Xylem will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that ITT and Xylem will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 25582, "SIC": 3812, "TIC": "LHX"}
