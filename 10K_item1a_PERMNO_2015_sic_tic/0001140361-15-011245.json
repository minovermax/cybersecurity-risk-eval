{"cik": "1572552", "company": "Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to various risks, including those described below. You should consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this report, which could materially adversely affect our proposed operations, our business prospects, and financial condition, and the value of an investment in our business. There may be other factors that are not mentioned here or of which we are not presently aware that could also affect our business operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nWe have a history of operating losses and negative cash flows\nSince our inception in September 2012, we have incurred operating losses and negative cash flow, and we expect to continue to incur losses and negative cash flow in the future. Our net losses for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014, and 2013, the period from September 2012 (inception) to December 31, 2012, and the period from September 2012 (inception) to December 31, 2014 were $10,097,154, $22,379,744, $758,893 and $33,235,791, respectively, and we had an accumulated deficit of $33,235,791 and $23,138,637 as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2013 and our accumulated deficit as of that date include $17,458,766 charged as in-process research and development expenses (\u201cIPR&D\u201d) in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 805-50 on account of our acquisition of certain assets from Geron. See Notes 2 and 3 to Financial Statements. BioTime previously funded our formation and operating costs but we do not expect BioTime to continue to do so in the future. We have limited cash resources and will depend upon future equity financings, research grants, financings through collaborations with third parties, and sales of BioTime common shares that we as a source of funding for our operations. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing we need from any of those sources, or that any such financing that may become available will be on terms that are favorable to us and our shareholders.\nFailure to attract and retain skilled personnel and key relationships could impair our research and development efforts\nOur operations are still in the start-up stage and we had only 25 employees as of December 31, 2014. We will need to recruit and hire additional qualified research scientists, laboratory technicians, clinical development, and management personnel. Competition for these types of personnel is intense and we may experience delays in hiring the qualified people that we need. The inability to attract and retain sufficient qualified management, scientific, or technical personnel may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. We partially rely on BioTime to provide financial accounting management and personnel, human resources, and intellectual property management. We will also rely on consultants and advisors who are either self-employed or employed by other organizations, and they may have conflicts of interest or other commitments, such as consulting or advisory contracts with other organizations, that may affect their ability to perform services for us.\nWe will spend a substantial amount of our capital on research and development but we might not succeed in developing products and technologies that are useful in medicine\n\u00b7 The product development work we plan to do is costly, time consuming and uncertain as to its results.\n\u00b7 We will attempt to develop new medical products and technologies that might not prove to be safe and efficacious in human medical applications. Many of the products and technologies that we will seek to develop have not been applied in human medicine and have only been used in laboratory studies in vitro or in animals. Only two of the product candidates that we have acquired have been used in clinical trials, and those were early stage trials involving only a small number of patients.\n\u00b7 If we are successful in developing a new technology or product, refinement of the new technology or product and definition of the practical applications and limitations of the technology or product may take years and require the expenditure of large sums of money.\nThe amount and pace of research and development work that we can do or sponsor, and our ability to commence and complete clinical trials required to obtain FDA and foreign regulatory approval of our products, depends upon the amount of money available to us\n\u00b7 We may have to limit our laboratory research and development work based on the amount of our cash resources.\n\u00b7 We plan to seek research and development grants from government agencies and to enter into collaborative product development agreements through which third parties will provide funding or otherwise bear the cost of research and development or clinical trials of our product candidates. There is no assurance that the amount of any grants that we may receive will be adequate for our needs. The agreements we entered into to date with CIRM and CRUK are subject to termination if certain milestones are not achieved. Hence, there is no assurance that we will receive the full value of the agreement with either entity.\n\u00b7 Unless we are able to generate sufficient revenue or raise additional funds when needed, it is likely that we will be unable to continue our planned activities, even if we make progress in our research and development projects.\nWe will need to issue additional equity or debt securities in order to raise additional capital needed to pay our operating expenses\n\u00b7 We plan to incur substantial research and product development expenses, and we will need to raise additional capital to pay operating expenses until we are able to generate sufficient revenues from product sales, royalties, and license fees.\n\u00b7 It is likely that additional sales of equity or debt securities will be required in the near future to meet our short-term capital needs, unless we receive substantial research grants and revenues from the sale of any products that receive regulatory approval or we are successful in licensing or sublicensing our technology and we receive substantial licensing fees and royalties.\n\u00b7 Sales of additional equity securities could result in the dilution of the interests of present shareholders.\nThe condition of certain cells, cell lines and other biological materials that we acquired from Geron could impact the time and cost of commencing our research and product development programs\nThe cells, cell lines and other biological materials that we acquired are being stored under cryopreservation protocols intended to preserve their functionality. We have successfully completed the verification of the viability of three lots of AST-OPC1 cells that we intend to use in clinical trials. However, the functional condition of the other materials cannot be certified until they are tested in an appropriate laboratory setting by qualified scientific personnel using validated equipment. We intend to perform that testing on the cells that we intend to use in our research and development programs as the need arises.\nTo the extent that the cells we plan to use are not sufficiently functional for our purposes, we would need to incur the time and expense of regenerating cell lines from cell banks, or regenerating cell banks from cell stocks, which could delay and increase the cost of our research and development work using those cells.\nSales of any products we may develop may be adversely impacted by the availability of competing products\n\u00b7 In order to compete with other products, particularly those that sell at lower prices, our products will have to provide medically significant advantages.\n\u00b7 Physicians and hospitals may be reluctant to try a new product due to the high degree of risk associated with the application of new technologies and products in the field of human medicine.\n\u00b7 There also is a risk that our competitors may succeed at developing safer or more effective products that could render our products and technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.\nAny products that receive regulatory approval may be difficult and expensive to manufacture on a commercial scale\n\u00b7 hES derived therapeutic cells have only been produced on a small scale and not in quantities and at levels of purity and viability that will be needed for wide scale commercialization. If we are successful in developing products that consist of hES cells or other cells or products derived from hES or other cells, we will need to develop, alone or in collaboration with one or more pharmaceutical companies or contract manufacturers, technology for the commercial production of those products.\n\u00b7 Our hES cell or other cell-based products are likely to be more expensive to manufacture on a commercial scale than most other drugs on the market today. The high cost of manufacturing a product will require that we charge our customers a high price for the product in order to cover our costs and earn a profit. If the price of our products is too high, hospitals and physicians may be reluctant to purchase our products, especially if lower priced alternative products are available, and we may not be able to sell our products in sufficient volumes to recover our costs of development and manufacture or to earn a profit.\nWe do not have our own marketing, distribution, and sales resources for the commercialization of any products that we might successfully develop\n\u00b7 If we are successful in developing marketable products, we will need to build our own marketing, distribution, and sales capability for our products, which would require the investment of significant financial and management resources, or we will need to find collaborative marketing partners, independent sales representatives, or wholesale distributors for the commercial sale of our products.\n\u00b7 If we market products through arrangements with third parties, we may pay sales commissions to sales representatives or we may sell or consign products to distributors at wholesale prices. As a result, our gross profit from product sales may be lower than it would be if we were to sell our products directly to end users at retail prices through our own sales force.\n\u00b7 There can be no assurance that we will able to negotiate distribution or sales agreements with third parties on favorable terms to justify our investment in our products or achieve sufficient revenues to support our operations.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approvals for our therapeutic product candidates\nWe will need to rely on third parties, such as CRUK, contract research organizations, data management companies, contract clinical research associates, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct any clinical trials that we may undertake for our products. We may also rely on third parties to assist with our preclinical development of therapeutic product candidates. If we outsource clinical trials, we may be unable to directly control the timing, conduct and expense of our clinical trials. If we enlist third parties to conduct clinical trials and they fail to successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our therapeutic product candidates.\nWe will have certain obligations and may incur liabilities arising from clinical trials, and we do not yet know the scope of any resulting expenses that might arise\nWe face the risk of incurring liabilities to patients who participate in clinical trials of our product candidates if they incur any injuries as a result of their participation. We will also be obligated to obtain information and prepare reports about the health of the clinical trial patients. In addition, we have assumed Geron\u2019s obligations to obtain information and prepare reports about the health of patients, and we have assumed any liabilities to those patients that might arise from any injuries they may have incurred, as a result of their participation in the clinical trials of Geron\u2019s GRN-OPC1 cell replacement therapy for spinal cord damage and its GRN-VAC1 immunological therapy for certain cancers. We are not aware of any claims by patients alleging injuries suffered as a result of any of those clinical trials, but if any claims are made and if liability can be established, the amount of any liability that we may incur, depending upon the nature and extent of any provable injuries, could exceed our insurance coverage, and the amount of the liability could be material to our financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we lose the services of the key personnel upon whom we depend\nOur stem cell research program will be directed primarily by our President and Chief Executive Officer Pedro Lichtinger and by our President of Research and Development, Dr. Jane S. Lebkowski. The loss of the services of Mr. Lichtinger or Dr. Lebkowski could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of system failures\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such events could cause interruption of our operations. For example, the loss of data for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory filings and development efforts and significantly increase our costs. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nFailure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Our growth and entry into new products, technologies and markets will place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud.\nWe will initially rely in part on financial systems maintained by BioTime and upon services provided by BioTime personnel. BioTime will allocate certain expenses among itself, us, and BioTime\u2019s other subsidiaries, which creates a risk that the allocations may not accurately reflect the benefit of an expenditure or use of financial or other resources by us, BioTime as our parent company, and the BioTime subsidiaries among which the allocations are made.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe will face certain risks arising from regulatory, legal, and economic factors that affect our business and the business of other pharmaceutical and biological product development companies. Because we are a small company with limited revenues and limited capital resources, we may be less able to bear the financial impact of these risks than larger companies that have substantial income and available capital.\nIf we do not receive FDA and other regulatory approvals we will not be permitted to sell our products\nThe cell-based products that we are developing cannot be sold until the FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities approve the products for medical use. To date, long-term safety and efficacy has not been demonstrated in clinical trials for any of our therapeutic product candidates. The need to obtain regulatory approval to market a new product means that:\n\u00b7 we will have to conduct expensive and time consuming clinical trials of new products. The full cost of conducting and completing clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA and foreign regulatory approval of a new product cannot be presently determined, but could exceed our current financial resources;\n\u00b7 clinical trials and the regulatory approval process for a cell-based product can take several years to complete. As a result, we will incur the expense and delay inherent in seeking FDA and foreign regulatory approval of new products, even if the results of clinical trials are favorable;\n\u00b7 data obtained from preclinical and clinical studies is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory agency approvals. Delays in the regulatory approval process or rejections of an application for approval of a new drug or cell-based product may be encountered as a result of changes in regulatory agency policy;\n\u00b7 because the therapeutic products we plan to develop with hES and iPS technology involve the application of new technologies and approaches to medicine, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may subject those products to additional or more stringent review than drugs or biologics derived from other technologies. No therapeutic product based on hES or iPS technology has been approved by the FDA to date.\n\u00b7 a product that is approved may be subject to restrictions on use;\n\u00b7 the FDA can limit or withdraw approval of a product if problems arise; and\n\u00b7 we will face similar regulatory issues in foreign countries.\nClinical trial failures can occur at any stage of the testing and we may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent commercialization of our current or future therapeutic product candidates\nAll of our product candidates are either at early stages of clinical development or at the preclinical or research stages of development. Clinical trial failures or delays can occur at any stage of the trials, and may be directly or indirectly caused by a variety of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7 delays in securing clinical investigators or trial sites for our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 delays in obtaining Institutional Review Board (\u201cIRB\u201d) and other regulatory approvals to commence a clinical trial;\n\u00b7 slower than anticipated rates of patient recruitment and enrollment, or failing to reach the targeted number of patients due to competition for patients from other trials;\n\u00b7 limited or no availability of coverage, reimbursement and adequate payment from health maintenance organizations and other third party payors for the use of agents used in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 negative or inconclusive results from clinical trials;\n\u00b7 unforeseen side effects interrupting, delaying, or halting clinical trials of our therapeutic product candidates, and possibly resulting in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of our therapeutic product candidates;\n\u00b7 unforeseen safety issues;\n\u00b7 uncertain dosing issues;\n\u00b7 approval and introduction of new therapies or changes in standards of practice or regulatory guidance that render our clinical trial endpoints or the targeting of our proposed indications obsolete;\n\u00b7 inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment or problems with investigator or patient compliance with the trial protocols;\n\u00b7 inability to replicate in large controlled studies safety and efficacy data obtained from a limited number of patients in uncontrolled trials;\n\u00b7 inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols; and\n\u00b7 unavailability of clinical trial supplies.\nGovernment imposed bans or restrictions, and religious, moral and ethical concerns on the use of hES cells could prevent us from developing and successfully marketing stem cell products\n\u00b7 Government imposed bans or restrictions on the use of embryos or hES cells research and development in the United States and abroad could generally constrain stem cell research, thereby limiting the market and demand for any of our products that receive regulatory approval. In March 2009, President Obama lifted certain restrictions on federal funding of research involving the use of hES cells, and in accordance with President Obama\u2019s executive order, the National Institutes of Health has adopted new guidelines for determining the eligibility of hES cell lines for use in federally funded research. The central focus of the proposed guidelines is to assure that hES cells used in federally funded research were derived from human embryos that were created for reproductive purposes, were no longer needed for this purpose, and were voluntarily donated for research purposes with the informed written consent of the donors. hES cells that were derived from embryos created for research purposes rather than reproductive purposes, and other hES cells that were not derived in compliance with the guidelines, are not eligible for use in federally funded research.\n\u00b7 California law requires that stem cell research be conducted under the oversight of a stem cell research oversight (\u201cSCRO\u201d) committee. Many kinds of stem cell research, including the derivation of new hES cell lines, may only be conducted in California with the prior written approval of the SCRO. A SCRO could prohibit or impose restrictions on the research we plan to do.\n\u00b7 The use of hES cells gives rise to religious, moral and ethical issues regarding the appropriate means of obtaining the cells and the appropriate use and disposal of the cells. These considerations could lead to more restrictive government regulations or could generally constrain stem cell research thereby limiting the market and demand for any of our products that receive regulatory approval.\nIf we are unable to obtain and enforce patents and to protect our trade secrets, others could use our technology to compete with us, which could limit opportunities for us to generate revenues by licensing our technology and selling products\n\u00b7 Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and maintain trade secrets in the United States and in other countries. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining and enforcing patents, our competitors could use our technology and create products that compete with our products, without paying license fees or royalties to us.\n\u00b7 The preparation, filing, and prosecution of patent applications can be costly and time consuming. Our limited financial resources may not permit us to pursue patent protection of all of our technology and products throughout the world.\n\u00b7 Even if we are able to obtain issued patents covering our technology or products, we may have to incur substantial legal fees and other expenses to enforce our patent rights in order to protect our technology and products from infringing uses. We may not have the financial resources to finance the litigation required to preserve our patent and trade secret rights.\nThere is no certainty that our pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents\n\u00b7 We have acquired patent applications for technology that Geron developed, and we obtained licenses for a number of patent applications covering technology developed by others that we believe will be useful in producing new products, and which we believe may be of commercial interest to other companies that may be willing to sublicense the technology for fees or royalty payments. We may also file new patent applications in the future seeking patent protection for new technology or products that we develop ourselves or jointly with others. However, there is no assurance that any of the patent applications that we acquired or any licensed patent applications or any future patent applications that we may file in the United States or abroad will result in the issuance of patents.\n\u00b7 In Europe, the European Patent Convention prohibits the granting of European patents for inventions that concern \"uses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes.\" The European Patent Office is presently interpreting this prohibition broadly, and is applying it to reject patent claims that pertain to hES cells. However, this broad interpretation is being challenged through the European Patent Office appeals system. As a result, we do not yet know whether or to what extent we will be able to obtain patent protection for our hES cell technologies in Europe.\nThe patent protection for our product candidates or products may expire before we are able to maximize their commercial value, which may subject us to increased competition and reduce or eliminate our opportunity to generate product revenue\nThe patents for our product candidates have varying expiration dates. When these patents expire, we may be subject to increased competition and our opportunity to establish or maintain product revenue could be substantially reduced or eliminated. As a result we may not be able to recover our development costs. In some of the larger economic territories, such as the United States and Europe, patent term extension/restoration may be available to compensate for time taken during aspects of the product candidate's regulatory review. We cannot, however, be certain that an extension will be granted or, if granted, what the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded during any extended period will be. In addition, even though some regulatory agencies may provide some other exclusivity for a product candidate under its own laws and regulations, we may not be able to qualify the product candidate or obtain the exclusive time period.\nThe process of applying for and obtaining patents can be expensive and slow\n\u00b7 The preparation and filing of patent applications, and the maintenance of patents that are issued, may require substantial time and money.\n\u00b7 A patent interference proceeding may be instituted with the USPTO when more than one person files a patent application covering the same technology, or if someone wishes to challenge the validity of an issued patent. At the completion of the interference proceeding, the USPTO will determine which competing applicant is entitled to the patent, or whether an issued patent is valid. Patent interference proceedings are complex, highly contested legal proceedings, and the USPTO\u2019s decision is subject to appeal. This means that if an interference proceeding arises with respect to any of our patent applications, we may experience significant expenses and delay in obtaining a patent, and if the outcome of the proceeding is unfavorable to us, the patent could be issued to a competitor rather than to us.\n\u00b7 A derivation proceeding may be instituted by the USPTO or an inventor alleging that a patent or application was derived from the work of another inventor.\n\u00b7 Post Grant Review under the new America Invents Act will make available opposition-like proceedings in the United States. As with the USPTO interference proceedings, Post Grant Review proceedings will be very expensive to contest and can result in significant delays in obtaining patent protection or can result in a denial of a patent application.\n\u00b7 Oppositions to the issuance of patents may be filed under European patent law and the patent laws of certain other countries. As with the USPTO interference proceedings, these foreign proceedings can be very expensive to contest and can result in significant delays in obtaining a patent or can result in a denial of a patent application.\nWe may be subject to patent infringement claims that could be costly to defend, which may limit our ability to use disputed technologies, and which could prevent us from pursuing research and development or commercialization of some of our products, require us to pay licensing fees to have freedom to operate and/or result in monetary damages or other liability for us\nThe success of our business will depend significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and other proprietary rights of others. If the technology that we use infringes a patent held by others, we could be sued for monetary damages by the patent holder or its licensee, or we could be prevented from continuing research, development, and commercialization of products that rely on that technology, unless we are able to obtain a license to use the patent. The cost and availability of a license to a patent cannot be predicted, and the likelihood of obtaining a license at an acceptable cost would be lower if the patent holder or any of its licensees is using the patent to develop or market a product with which our product would compete. If we could not obtain a necessary license, we would need to develop or obtain rights to alternative technologies, which could prove costly and could cause delays in product development, or we could be forced to discontinue the development or marketing of any products that were developed using the technology covered by the patent.\nOur patents may not protect any of our products from competition\nWe have acquired patents and patent applications filed in the United States, Canada, the European Union countries, and in other foreign countries for a variety of hES and iPS technologies.\n\u00b7 We might not be able to obtain any additional patents, and any patents that we do obtain might not be comprehensive enough to provide us with meaningful patent protection.\n\u00b7 There will always be a risk that our competitors might be able to successfully challenge the validity or enforceability of any patent issued to us.\n\u00b7 In addition to interference proceedings, the USPTO can reexamine issued patents at the request of a third party seeking to have the patent invalidated. This means that patents owned or licensed by us may be subject to reexamination and may be lost if the outcome of the reexamination is unfavorable to us. Our patents may be subject to inter partes review (replacing the reexamination proceeding), a proceeding in which a third party can challenge the validity of one of our patents.\nIf we fail to meet our obligations under license agreements, we may lose our rights to key technologies on which our business depends\nOur business will depend in part on several technologies that are based in part on technology licensed from third parties, including the University of Colorado, the University of California, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. Those third-party license agreements impose obligations on us, including payment obligations and obligations to pursue development of commercial products under the licensed patents or technology. If a licensor believes that we have failed to meet our obligations under a license agreement, the licensor could seek to limit or terminate our license rights, which could lead to costly and time-consuming litigation and, potentially, a loss of the licensed rights. During the period of any such litigation our ability to carry out the development and commercialization of potential products, and our ability to raise capital, could be significantly and negatively affected. If our license rights were restricted or ultimately lost, we would not be able to continue to use the licensed technology in our business.\nThe price and sale of any of our products that receive regulatory approval may be limited by health insurance coverage and government regulation\nSuccess in selling any of our products that receive regulatory approval may depend in part on the extent to which health insurance companies, HMOs, and government health administration authorities such as Medicare and Medicaid will pay for the cost of the products and related treatment. Until we actually introduce a new product into the medical market place we will not know with certainty whether adequate health insurance, HMO, and government coverage will be available to permit the product to be sold at a price high enough for us to generate a profit. In some foreign countries, pricing or profitability of health care products is subject to government control which may result in low prices for our products. In the United States, there have been a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government controls, and new proposals are likely to be made in the future.\nThe implementation of the ACA in the United States may adversely affect our business.\nAs a result of the March 2010 adoption of the ACA in the United States, substantial changes are being made to the current system for paying for healthcare in the United States, including programs to extend medical benefits to millions of individuals who currently lack insurance coverage. The changes contemplated by the ACA are subject to rule-making and implementation timelines that extend for several years, as well as initiatives in Congress to amend or repeal the law, and this uncertainty limits our ability to forecast changes that may occur in the future. However, implementation of the ACA has already begun with respect to certain significant cost-saving measures, including changes to several government healthcare programs that may cover the cost of our future products, including Medicaid, Medicare Parts B and D, and these efforts could have a materially adverse impact on our future financial prospects and performance. For example, with respect to Medicaid, in order for a manufacturer\u2019s products to be reimbursed by federal funding under Medicaid, the manufacturer must enter into a Medicaid rebate agreement with the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and must pay certain rebates to the states based on utilization data provided by each state to the manufacturer and to CMS, and based on pricing data provided by the manufacturer to the federal government. The states share this savings with the federal government, and sometimes implement their own additional supplemental rebate programs. Under the Medicaid drug rebate program, the rebate amount for most branded drug products was previously equal to a minimum of 15.1% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP, or the AMP less Best Price, whichever is greater. Effective January 1, 2010, the ACA generally increases the size of the Medicaid rebates paid by manufacturers for single source and innovator multiple source (brand name) drug product from a minimum of 15.1% to a minimum of 23.1% of the AMP, subject to certain exceptions, for example, for certain clotting factors, the increase is limited to a minimum of 17.1% of the AMP. For non-innovator multiple source (generic) products, the rebate percentage is increased from a minimum of 11.0% to a minimum of 13.0% of AMP. In 2010, the ACA also newly extended this rebate obligation to prescription drugs covered by Medicaid managed care organizations. These increases in required rebates may adversely affect our future financial prospects and performance. The ACA also creates new rebate obligations for products under Medicare Part D, a partial, voluntary prescription drug benefit created by the United States federal government primarily for persons 65 years old and over. The Part D drug program is administered through private insurers that contract with CMS. Beginning in 2011, the healthcare reform law generally requires that in order for a drug manufacturer\u2019s products to be reimbursed under Medicare Part D, the manufacturer must enter into a Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program agreement with the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and reimburse each Medicare Part D plan sponsor an amount equal to 50% savings for the manufacturer\u2019s brand name drugs and biologics which the Part D plan sponsor has provided to its Medicare Part D beneficiaries who are in the \u201cdonut hole\u201d (or a gap in Medicare Part D coverage for beneficiaries who have expended certain amounts for drugs). The Part D plan sponsor is responsible for calculating and providing the discount directly to its beneficiaries and for reporting these amounts paid to CMS\u2019s contractor, which notifies drug manufacturers of the rebate amounts it must pay to each Part D plan sponsor. The rebate requirement could adversely affect our future financial performance, particularly if contracts with Part D plans cannot be favorably renegotiated or the Part D plan sponsors fail to accurately calculate payments due in a manner that overstates our rebate obligation. The ACA also introduced a biosimilar pathway that will permit companies to obtain FDA approval of generic versions of existing biologics based upon reduced documentation and data requirements deemed sufficient to demonstrate safety and efficacy than are required for the pioneer biologics. The new law provides that a biosimilar application may be submitted as soon as four years after the reference product is first licensed, and that the FDA may not make approval of an application effective until 12 years after the reference product was first licensed. With the likely introduction of biosimilars in the United States, we expect in the future to face greater competition from biosimilar products, including a possible increase in patent challenges. The FDA has reported meeting with sponsors who are interested in developing biosimilar products, and is developing regulations to implement the abbreviated regulatory review pathway. Regarding access to our products, the ACA established and provided significant funding for a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to coordinate and fund Comparative Effectiveness Research, or CER. While the stated intent of CER is to develop information to guide providers to the most efficacious therapies, outcomes of CER could influence the reimbursement or coverage for therapies that are determined to be less cost-effective than others. Should any of our products be determined to be less cost effective than alternative therapies, the levels of reimbursement for these products, or the willingness to reimburse at all, could be impacted, which could materially impact our future financial prospects and results.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship With BioTime\nWe are a subsidiary of BioTime, and accordingly our business is substantially controlled by BioTime.\nAs of March 9, 2015, BioTime owns approximately 67.5% of our issued and outstanding Series A Shares, and also holds warrants that, if exercised, would increase its ownership by approximately 2.9%. Because BioTime owns a majority of the outstanding Series A Shares, it has the voting power to elect our entire Board of Directors. Presently, four of the eight members of our Board of Directors are also directors or officers of BioTime, and another director is an employee of Broadwood Capital, Inc., which is the general partner of Broadwood Partners, L.P., the partnership that is the largest shareholder of BioTime. Some of our directors also serve on the Boards of Directors of one or more of BioTime\u2019s other subsidiaries. The relationship of our directors with BioTime means that we will not have a Board of Directors making business decisions on our behalf independent from BioTime. Even those of our directors who do not serve on the BioTime Board of Directors will be elected to our Board of Directors by BioTime, and they may be removed from our Board by BioTime, as the majority shareholder.\nBioTime could cause corporate actions to be taken even if the interests of BioTime conflict with the interests of our other shareholders. This concentration of voting power could have the effect of deterring or preventing a change in control that might be beneficial to our other shareholders.\nAs the majority shareholder, BioTime will have the voting power to approve or disapprove any matter or corporate transaction presented to our shareholders for approval, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7 any amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws;\n\u00b7 any merger or consolidation of us with another company;\n\u00b7 any recapitalization or reorganization of our capital stock;\n\u00b7 any sale of assets or purchase of assets; or\n\u00b7 a corporate dissolution or a plan of liquidation of our business.\nWe partially rely upon BioTime for certain services and resources\nAlthough we have our own research facilities, scientific personnel, and some management personnel, we partially rely on BioTime to provide certain management and administrative services, including patent prosecution, certain legal services, accounting, financial management, and controls over financial accounting and reporting. We have entered into a Shared Facilities and Services Agreement\u201d) with BioTime under which we have agreed to bear costs allocated to us by BioTime for the use of BioTime human resources and for services and materials provided for our benefit by BioTime. We pay BioTime 105% of its costs of providing personnel and services to us, and for any use of its facilities by us, including an allocation of general overhead based on that use. We may also share the services of some research personnel with BioTime.\nIf BioTime\u2019s human resources and facilities are not sufficient to serve both BioTime\u2019s needs and ours, we will have to hire additional personnel of our own, either on a full-time or part-time basis, as employees or as consultants, and the cost of doing so could be greater than the costs that would be allocated to us by BioTime. Also, any new personnel that we may need to hire may not be as familiar with our business or operations as BioTime\u2019s personnel, which means that we would incur the expense and inefficiencies related to training new employees or consultants.\nConflicts of interest may arise from our relationship with BioTime\nOur relationship with BioTime could give rise to certain conflicts of interest that could have an impact on our research and development programs, business opportunities, and operations generally.\n\u00b7 We and BioTime or any of its other subsidiaries may determine to engage in research and development of the same or similar products or technologies, or products that would otherwise compete in the market place. Even if we utilize different technologies than BioTime or its other subsidiaries, we could find ourselves in competition with them for research scientists, financing and other resources, licensing, manufacturing, and distribution arrangements, and for customers if we and BioTime or another BioTime subsidiary both bring products to market.\n\u00b7 Because we are a subsidiary of BioTime, BioTime could prevent us from engaging in research and development programs, investments, business ventures, or agreements to develop, license, or acquire products or technologies that would or might compete with those owned, licensed, or under development by BioTime or any of its other subsidiaries.\n\u00b7 BioTime may determine that some of our patents or technology would be useful in its business or that of another BioTime subsidiary, and BioTime or another BioTime subsidiary may hold patents or technology that we may determine would be useful in our business. In such cases we may enter into license or sublicense agreements with BioTime or another BioTime subsidiary for the use of such patents or technology. Conflicts of interest will arise in determining the scope and financial terms of any such licenses or sublicenses, including the fields of use permitted, licensing fees, and royalties, if any, and other matters.\n\u00b7 BioTime and its other subsidiaries will engage for their own accounts in research and product development programs, investments, and business ventures, and we will not be entitled to participate or to receive an interest in those programs, investments, or business ventures. BioTime and its other subsidiaries will not be obligated to present any particular research and development, investment, or business opportunity to us, even if the opportunity would be within the scope of our research and development plans or programs, business objectives, or investment policies. These opportunities may include, for example, opportunities to acquire businesses or assets, including but not limited to patents and other intellectual property that could be used by us or by BioTime or by any of BioTime\u2019s other subsidiaries. Our respective boards of directors will have to determine which company should pursue those opportunities, taking into account relevant facts and circumstances at the time, such as the financial and other resources of the companies available to acquire and utilize the opportunity, and the best \u201cfit\u201d between the opportunity and the business and research and development programs of the companies. However, since BioTime will have the ultimate power to elect the members of our Board of Directors, BioTime may have the ultimate say in decision making with respect to the allocation of opportunities.\n\u00b7 If we enter into any patent or technology license or sublicense, or any other agreement with BioTime or with another BioTime subsidiary, the BioTime companies that are parties to the agreement may have a conflict of interest in determining how and when they should enforce their rights under the agreement if the other BioTime company that is a party were to default or otherwise fail to perform any of its obligations under the agreement.\n\u00b7 One of our significant assets is 3,852,880 BioTime common shares that we held as of December 31, 2014. Through the Asset Contribution Agreement we acquired 8,902,077 BioTime common shares from BioTime in October 2013 and we sold a portion of those shares during June 2014. We expect to sell the remaining BioTime common shares from time to time, or to pledge those shares as collateral for loans, to raise capital to finance our operations. Because a sale of those shares could have a depressing effect on the market value of BioTime common shares, BioTime will have a continuing interest in the number of shares we sell, the prices at which we sell the shares, and time and manner in which the shares are sold. Further, we may need or find it desirable to sell BioTime common shares at the same time as BioTime, or other BioTime subsidiaries that hold BioTime common shares, also desire to sell some of their BioTime common shares. Concurrent sales of BioTime common shares by us, BioTime, or other BioTime subsidiaries could have a depressing effect on the market price of the BioTime common shares, lowering the price at which we and they are able to sell BioTime common shares and resulting in lower net proceeds from the sales. We plan to coordinate any future sales of our BioTime common shares with BioTime and its other subsidiaries in order to provide an orderly and controlled process for raising capital through the sale of BioTime shares. This will include an agreement as to the number of shares to be sold, the time period or \u201cmarket window\u201d for selling shares, the use of a common securities broker-dealer, and a fair allocation of net sales based on average sales prices during any trading day on which we and they sell BioTime shares.\n\u00b7 Each conflict of interest will be resolved by our respective boards of directors in keeping with their fiduciary duties and such policies as they may implement from time to time. However, the terms and conditions of patent and technology licenses and other agreements between us and BioTime or other BioTime subsidiaries will not be negotiated on an arm\u2019s-length basis due to BioTime\u2019s ownership of a controlling interest in us and due to the commonality of directors serving on our respective boards of directors.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe could lose our CIRM grant if we fail to meet the clinical trial milestones that are a condition to CIRM\u2019s obligation to provide funding\nWe are depending upon our grant from CIRM as a source of financing for the costs of conducting our Phase I/IIa clinical trial and process development of AST-OPC1. Under the terms of the CIRM grant, we must meet certain efficacy and progress milestones pertaining to the clinical trial. If we fail to meet any of the milestones within the specified time frame, CIRM may discontinue providing grant funds to us, which could force us to postpone, delay, or discontinue the clinical trial and development work for the product.\nEstablishing and maintaining strategic alliances is a key component of our business strategy. If we are unable to establish and maintain strategic alliances for our therapeutic product candidates, we may have to reduce or delay our product development or increase our expenditures\nA key component of our current strategy for developing, manufacturing and commercializing our therapeutic product candidates will be entering into strategic alliances with pharmaceutical companies or other industry participants to advance our programs and enable us to maintain our financial and operational capacity. We will face significant competition in seeking appropriate alliances. We may not be able to negotiate alliances on acceptable terms, if at all. If our strategic alliances do not result in the successful development and commercialization of our product candidates or if one or more of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research and development funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. If we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements, our continued development of our product candidates could be delayed and we may need to obtain additional funding, which may be unavailable or available only on unfavorable terms.\nIf we are able to enter into product development and marketing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies, we may license product development, manufacturing, and marketing rights to the pharmaceutical company or to a joint venture company formed with the pharmaceutical company. Under such arrangements we might receive only a royalty on sales of the products developed or an equity interest in a joint venture company that develops the product. As a result, our revenues from the sale of those products may be substantially less than the amount of revenues and gross profits that we might receive if we were to develop, manufacture, and market the products ourselves.\nWe may become dependent on possible future collaborations to develop and commercialize many of our product candidates and to provide the manufacturing, regulatory compliance, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities required for the success of our business\nWe may enter into various kinds of collaborative research and development, manufacturing, and product marketing agreements to develop and commercialize our products. Any future milestone payments and cost reimbursements from collaboration agreements could provide an important source of financing for our research and development programs, thereby facilitating the application of our technology to the development and commercialization of our products, but there are risks associated with entering into collaboration arrangements.\nThere is a risk that we could become dependent upon one or more collaborative arrangements for product development or manufacturing or as a source of revenues from the sale of any products that may be developed by us alone or through one of the collaborative arrangements. A collaborative arrangement upon which we might depend might be terminated by our collaboration partner or they might determine not to actively pursue the development or commercialization of our products. A collaboration partner also may not be precluded from independently pursuing competing products and drug delivery approaches or technologies.\nThere is a risk that a collaboration partner might fail to perform its obligations under the collaborative arrangements or may be slow in performing its obligations. In addition, a collaboration partner may experience financial difficulties at any time that could prevent it from having available funds to contribute to the collaboration. If a collaboration partner fails to conduct its product development, manufacturing, commercialization, regulatory compliance, sales and marketing or distribution activities successfully and in a timely manner, or if it terminates or materially modifies its agreements with us, the development and commercialization of one or more product candidates could be delayed, curtailed or terminated because we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue product development, manufacturing, and commercialization on our own.\nWe have no experience in manufacturing, marketing, selling or distributing products, and we may need to rely on marketing partners or contract sales companies if any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval\nEven if we are able to develop our products and obtain necessary regulatory approvals, we have no experience or capabilities of our own in manufacturing, marketing, selling or distributing any of the products that we plan to develop. Accordingly, we will be dependent on our ability to build our own manufacturing, marketing, and distribution capability for our products, which would require the investment of significant financial and management resources, or we will need to find third parties to manufacture our products, and collaborative marketing partners or contract sales companies for commercial sale of those products. Even if we find one or more potential third party manufacturers and marketing partners, of which there can be no assurance, we may not be able to negotiate manufacturing, licensing, or marketing contracts on favorable terms to justify our investment or achieve adequate revenues and margins.\nIndustry and other market data used in this Annual Report, including those undertaken by us or our engaged consultants, may prove to be unrepresentative of current and future market conditions or future results\nThis Annual Report includes statistical and other industry and market data that we obtained from industry publications and research, surveys and studies conducted by third parties, and surveys and studies we commissioned, regarding the market potential for our product candidates. Although we believe that such information has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, neither the sources of such data, nor we, can guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. While we believe these industry publications and third party research, surveys and studies are reliable, we have not independently verified such data. With respect to the information from third party consultants, the results of that study represent the independent consultants\u2019 own methodologies, assumptions, research, analysis, projections, estimations, composition of respondent pool, presentation of data, and adjustments, each of which may ultimately prove to be incorrect, and cause actual results and market viability to differ materially from those presented in such report. Readers should not place undue reliance on this information.\nRisks Pertaining to Our Common Stock\nOwnership of our common stock will entail certain risks associated with the volatility of prices for our shares and the fact that we do not pay dividends on our common stock.\nBecause we are engaged in the development of stem cell therapeutic products, the price of our common stock may rise and fall rapidly\nThe market price of our common stock like that of the shares of many biotechnology companies, may be highly volatile. The price of our common stock may rise or fall rapidly as a result of a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 sales or potential sales of substantial amounts of our common stock;\n\u00b7 results of preclinical testing or clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 announcements about us or about our competitors, including clinical trial results, regulatory approvals, new product introductions and commercial results;\n\u00b7 the cost of our development programs;\n\u00b7 the success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u00b7 litigation and other developments relating to our issued patents or patent applications or other proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 conditions in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us, including the failure of our earnings to meet analysts\u2019 expectations; and\n\u00b7 general economic, industry and market conditions.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control. The stock markets in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biotechnological companies in particular, have been experiencing extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price of the equity securities without regard to the operating performance of the issuing companies. Broad market fluctuations, as well as industry factors and general economic and political conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe recently enacted JOBS Act allows us to postpone the date by which we must comply with certain laws and regulations intended to protect investors and to reduce the amount of information we provide in our reports filed with the Commission, which could undermine investor confidence in our company and adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nThe recently enacted JOBS Act is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d As defined in the JOBS Act, a public company whose initial public offering of common equity securities occurred after December 8, 2011 and whose annual gross revenues are less than $1.0 billion will, in general, qualify as an emerging growth company until the earliest of:\n\u00b7 the last day of its fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of its initial public offering of common equity securities;\n\u00b7 the last day of its fiscal year in which it has annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more;\n\u00b7 the date on which it has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and\n\u00b7 the date on which it is deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d which will occur at such time as we (a) have an aggregate worldwide market value of common equity securities held by non-affiliates of $700 million or more as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (b) have been required to file annual and quarterly reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for a period of at least 12 months, and (c) have filed at least one annual report pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nUnder this definition, we are an emerging growth company and could remain an emerging growth company until as late as December 31, 2019.\nThe JOBS Act provides that, so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we will, among other things:\n\u00b7 be exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u00b7 be exempt from the \u201csay on pay\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers) and the \u201csay on golden parachute\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding stockholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations) of the Dodd-Frank Act and certain disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to compensation of our chief executive officer;\n\u00b7 be permitted to omit the detailed compensation discussion and analysis from proxy statements and reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and instead provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation; and\n\u00b7 be exempt from any rules that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report on the financial statements.\nAlthough we are still evaluating the JOBS Act, we currently take advantage of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are available to us so long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d except that we have irrevocably elected not to take advantage of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 102(b) of the JOBS Act. Among other things, this means that our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, which may increase the risk that weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected. Likewise, so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, we may elect not to provide you with certain information, including certain financial information and certain information regarding compensation of our executive officers, that we would otherwise have been required to provide in filings we make with the Commission, which may make it more difficult for investors and securities analysts to evaluate our company. As a result, investor confidence in our company and the market price of our securities may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur stock price could decline due to the large number of outstanding shares of our common stock eligible for future sale\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock could also make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nWe have not registered for sale or transfer under the Securities Act any of the 21,823,340 shares of our Series A Shares or 3,150,000 warrants that BioTime owns, or the Series A Shares that it may receive if it exercises its warrants. However, BioTime reserves the right to sell its Series A Shares and the warrants in the future or to distribute them to its shareholders.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on any of our classes of securities and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on the appreciation in the price of our securities.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on any class of our securities. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to fund our future growth and do not expect to declare or pay any dividend on any class of our securities in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only realize a gain on your investment in our securities if the market price of our securities appreciates and you sell your securities at a price above your cost after accounting for any taxes. The price of our securities may not appreciate in value or ever exceed the price that you paid for our securities.\nThe price of our common stock, and the value of our assets, will be affected by changes in the value of the BioTime common shares that we own\nAs of December 31, 2014, we held 3,852,880 of the 8,902,077 BioTime common shares we received from BioTime under the Asset Contribution Agreement. The value of our common stock will reflect, in part, the value of the BioTime common shares that we hold. The value of the BioTime common shares we hold will vary with the price at which BioTime common shares trade in the public market. The market price of BioTime common shares will be impacted by a number of factors, including the results of BioTime\u2019s operations.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our securities could decline.\nThe current trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us, our business, our markets and our competitors. We do not control these analysts. If securities analysts do not cover us, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary about us or our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the market and interest in our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock and our preferred stock\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present shareholders. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 150,000,000 shares of common stock, consisting of 75,000,000 Series A Shares and 75,000,000 of our Series B Shares. We are also authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. As of March 1, 2015, we had issued and outstanding 32,312,407 Series A Shares. We have also reserved 8,500,000 Series A Shares for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding warrants, and 4,500,000 Series A Shares for issuance under a stock option and stock purchase plan.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock or other securities in order to raise additional capital, or in connection with hiring or retaining employees or consultants, or in connection with future acquisitions of licenses to technology or rights to acquire products, in connection with future business acquisitions, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of common stock or other securities may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may also issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock having rights, preferences, and privileges senior to the rights of our common stock with respect to dividends, rights to share in distributions of our assets if we liquidate our company, or voting rights. Any preferred stock may also be convertible into Series A Shares on terms that would be dilutive to holders of common stock.", "PERMNO": 14950, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "AST"}
