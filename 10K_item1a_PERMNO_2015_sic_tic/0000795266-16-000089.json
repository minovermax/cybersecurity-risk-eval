These factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking and other statements that (a) we make in registration statements, periodic reports and other filings with the SEC and from time to time in our news releases, annual reports and other written reports or communications, (b) we post on or make available through our websites and/or through other electronic channels, and (c) our personnel and representatives make orally from time to time.\nSoft or negative economic or housing market conditions generally or in our served markets may materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated financial statements.\nSince 2012, the housing market has continued to improve compared to the several difficult years of the housing downturn from mid-2006 through 2011. The improvement has been driven primarily by steady demand for homes, fairly low inventories of homes available for sale and generally healthy economic and demographic factors. However, the performance of individual housing markets varied throughout 2015, with home sales activity and selling price appreciation robust in certain markets and tepid in others due to, among other things, rising housing prices and/or inventory levels.\nWe expect that such unevenness in housing market conditions will continue in 2016 and beyond, and that there will be fluctuations among and within individual housing markets. These fluctuations may be significant and unfavorable, and could be more pronounced and/or prolonged in our served markets. Our operations and consolidated financial statements can be substantially affected by adverse changes in prevailing business conditions, including, among others:\n\u2022\nweak economic, income and employment growth;\n\u2022\ndiminished population growth, household formations and other negative demographic changes;\n\u2022\nhigh consumer debt levels, including elevated student loan balances;\n\u2022\ndelinquencies, defaults and foreclosures on mortgage loans;\n\u2022\nincreases in interest rates;\n\u2022\nvolatility and uncertainty in domestic and international financial, capital and consumer lending markets;\n\u2022\nlack of availability of or prohibitive costs for mortgage loans;\n\u2022\nincreased personal income tax rates and/or more restrictive personal income tax deduction provisions, including for the deduction of mortgage loan interest payments, real estate taxes and other homeownership-related expenses;\n\u2022\nlimited homebuyer interest in our product designs and/or community locations; and\n\u2022\nlack of consumer interest in purchasing a home compared to other housing alternatives.\nWe can provide no assurance that these factors, which are outside of our control, will not occur, persist for an extended period and/or worsen, or that the generally favorable housing market conditions at present will continue for any length of time. Inclement weather, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, droughts and fires), and other environmental conditions can delay the delivery of our homes and/or increase our costs. Civil unrest and acts of terrorism, and government responses to such acts, can also have a negative effect on our business.\nIf, on an overall basis or in our served markets, the economic or housing environment becomes more challenging; home sales or selling prices do not continue to advance at the same pace as in recent years or decline; or any or all of the negative factors or events described above occur, persist and/or worsen, there would likely be a corresponding adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial statements, including, but not limited to, the number of homes we deliver, our average selling prices, the amount of revenues we generate, our housing gross profit margins and our ability to operate profitably, and the effect may be material.\nContinued or additional tightening of mortgage lending standards and/or interest rate increases could adversely affect the availability or affordability of mortgage loans for potential buyers of our homes and thereby reduce our net orders.\nMortgage lenders have stopped offering certain mortgage loan products and significantly tightened their credit standards primarily due to the relatively high rates of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures on mortgage loans and fluctuations in their market value and the market value of securities backed by such loans during the housing downturn, and regulatory rules and enforcement actions (including sanctions, penalties and fines). As a result, it is generally difficult for some potential borrowers to finance the purchase of a home, causing volatility in and elevating cancellation rates for us and other homebuilders, and reducing demand for homes, including our homes. If mortgage lending standards further tighten, or mortgage lenders further curtail their product offerings, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial statements, as we depend on such lenders (including HCM) to provide mortgage loans that our buyers typically require to purchase our homes. Higher mortgage loan interest rates, which may result from the Federal Reserve deciding to increase the federal funds rate and/or investors\u2019 expectations as to the Federal Reserve\u2019s potential actions to influence interest rates, could also measurably reduce demand for our homes by increasing borrowers\u2019 financing costs, and thereby have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, federal regulators and lawmakers have considered steps that may significantly reduce the ability or authority of the Federal Housing Administration (\u201cFHA\u201d), the Federal National Mortgage Association (also known as \u201cFannie Mae\u201d) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (also known as \u201cFreddie Mac\u201d) to purchase or insure mortgage loans under their respective programs. Further, given federal budget deficits, the U.S. Treasury may not be able to continue, or may be required by future legislation or regulation to cease, supporting the mortgage loan-related activities of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the FHA and the Veterans Administration (\u201cVA\u201d) at present levels. The availability and affordability of mortgage loans, including interest rates or the costs for such loans, could be significantly diminished by a scaling back, tightening or termination of the federal government\u2019s mortgage loan-related programs. Because Fannie Mae-, Freddie Mac-, FHA- and VA-backed mortgage loans have been a critical source of liquidity for the mortgage finance industry and an important factor in marketing and selling many of our homes, any limitations or restrictions on the availability of, or higher consumer costs for, such government-backed financing could reduce our net orders and adversely affect our business and consolidated financial statements, and the effect could be material. Given the above and other factors, we can provide no assurance as to mortgage lenders\u2019 (including HCM\u2019s) ability or willingness to provide mortgage loans and other mortgage banking services to our homebuyers in future periods or as to their performance in doing so.\nThe mortgage banking operations of HCM are heavily regulated and subject to rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and quasi-governmental agencies. If Nationstar, which provides management oversight of HCM\u2019s operations, decides to end, or we decide to terminate, our relationship with respect to HCM or otherwise, or there is a finding that Nationstar or HCM materially violated any applicable rules or regulations and as a result is restricted from or unable to originate mortgage loans, our customers may experience significant mortgage loan funding issues, which could lower our net orders and revenues, and, in turn, have a material adverse impact on our business and our consolidated financial statements. In addition, while substantially all of the mortgage loans originated by HCM are sold within a short period of time in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non-recourse basis, HCM remains potentially responsible for certain limited representations and warranties it makes in connection with such mortgage loan sales. Mortgage investors, including the FHA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, could seek to have HCM buy back mortgage loans or compensate them for losses incurred on mortgage loans HCM has sold based on claims that it breached its limited representations or warranties. HCM has established reserves for potential losses. However, there can be no assurance that HCM will not have significant liabilities with respect to such claims in the future, which could exceed its reserves, or that the impact of such claims will not be material to HCM\u2019s financial condition or ability to operate, or cause us to recognize losses with respect to our equity interest in HCM, or cause our customers to seek mortgage loans from other lenders and/or experience mortgage loan funding issues that could delay our delivering homes to them and/or cause them to cancel their home purchase contracts with us.\nThird-party lenders may not complete mortgage loan originations for our homebuyers in a timely manner or at all, which can lead to cancellations and a lower backlog of orders, or to significant delays in our delivering homes and recognizing revenues from those homes.\nOur buyers may obtain mortgage financing for their home purchases from any lender or other provider of their choice, including HCM. If, due to credit or consumer lending market conditions, regulatory requirements, or other factors or business decisions, these lenders refuse or are unable to provide mortgage loans to our buyers, the number of homes we deliver, our business and our consolidated financial statements may be materially and adversely affected.\nBased on the number of homes we delivered in 2015, approximately 61% of our buyers who obtained mortgage financing used HCM to finance the purchase of their home. Although we expect an increasing percentage of our homebuyers will choose to use HCM, many of our homebuyers will continue to seek mortgage loans from other lenders and be subject to those lenders\u2019 ability to perform. We can provide no assurance as to other lenders\u2019 ability or willingness to complete, in a timely fashion or at all, the mortgage loan originations they start for our homebuyers. Such inability or unwillingness may result in mortgage loan funding issues that slow deliveries of our homes and/or cause cancellations, which in each case would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial statements. In addition, recent changes to mortgage loan disclosure requirements to consumers may potentially delay lenders\u2019 (including HCM\u2019s) completion of the mortgage loan funding process for borrowers and, therefore, extend the delivery of homes to our buyers beyond the time anticipated.\nOur current strategies may not generate improved financial and operational performance, and the continued implementation of these and other strategies may not be successful.\nWe believe our current strategies and initiatives will enable us to continue to profitably grow our business in 2016. However, our strategic and operational actions, including, but not limited to, our plans to expand our community count, may prove to be unsuitable for some or all of our served markets. We can provide no guarantee that our strategies, initiatives or actions will be successful, that they will generate growth or earnings or returns at any level or within any time frame, or that we will achieve in 2016 or beyond positive operational or financial results or results in any particular metric or measure equal to or better than our 2015 performance, or perform in any period as well as other homebuilders. In addition, we can provide no assurance that our community locations and products (or any refining of our products) will successfully attract consumers, command selling prices, or generate orders, revenues and/or housing gross profit margins at the levels we have experienced in the past or anticipate in future periods, at levels sufficient for us to be profitable or at levels higher than other homebuilders. We also cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to maintain these strategies, initiatives or actions in 2016 and, due to unexpectedly favorable or unfavorable market conditions or other factors, we may determine that we need to adjust, refine or abandon all or portions of these strategies, initiatives or actions, although we cannot guarantee that any such changes will be successful. The failure of any one or more of our present strategies, initiatives or actions, or the failure of any adjustments or alternative strategies, initiatives or actions that we may pursue or implement, to be successful would likely have an adverse effect on our ability to grow and increase the value and profitability of our business, to meet our debt service and other obligations necessary to operate our business in the ordinary course, and on our consolidated financial statements, as well as on our overall liquidity, and the effect in each case could be material.\nThe success of our present strategies, growth initiatives and our long-term performance depends on the availability of developable land that meets our investment return and marketing standards.\nThe availability of developable land, particularly finished and partially finished lots, that meets our investment return and marketing standards depends on a number of factors outside of our control, including, among other things, land availability in general, geographical/topographical constraints, land sellers\u2019 business relationships, competition for desirable property, legal or government agency or utility service company processes, our ability and the costs to obtain building permits and other regulatory approvals and prevailing conditions in the marketplace for land. Should suitable land become less available, the number of homes that we may be able to build and sell could be reduced. In addition, the cost of attractive land could continue to increase and adversely impact our housing gross profit margins, our consolidated financial statements and our ability to maintain ownership or control of a sufficient supply of land to meet our production goals. The availability of suitable land could also affect the success of our current strategies and growth initiatives. Further, if we decide to reduce our land acquisition activity in 2016 below our current plans due to a lack of available assets that meet our standards, our ability to increase our community count, to maintain or grow our revenues and housing gross profits and to maintain or increase our profitability in 2016 and beyond, would likely be constrained and could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.\nThe value of the land and housing inventory we own or control may fall significantly.\nThe value of the land and housing inventory we currently own or control depends on market conditions, including estimates of future demand for, and the revenues that can be generated from, this inventory. The value of our inventory can vary considerably because there is often a significant amount of time between our acquiring control or taking ownership of land and the delivery of homes on that land, particularly undeveloped and/or unentitled land. Based on our periodic assessments of our inventory for recoverability, we have from time to time written down certain of our inventory to its estimated fair value. We have also recorded charges against our earnings in connection with activating or selling certain land held for future development and with abandoning our interests in certain land controlled under land option contracts and other similar contracts that no longer met our investment return or marketing standards. If, in 2016, the present economic or housing environment weakens, if particular markets or submarkets experience challenging or unfavorable changes in prevailing business conditions, or if we elect to revise our marketing strategy relating to certain land positions, we may need to record additional charges against our earnings for inventory impairments or land option contract abandonments, or both, or in connection with land sales to reflect changes in fair value of land or land interests in our inventory, including assets we have previously written down. Any such charges could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements, including our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.\nHome selling prices and sales activity in particular markets in which we do business materially affect our consolidated financial statements because our business is concentrated in these markets.\nHome sales activity and selling prices in some of our key served markets have varied from time to time for market-specific and other reasons, including adverse weather, high levels of foreclosures, short sales and sales of lender-owned homes, and lack of affordability or economic contraction due to, among other things, the departure or decline of key industries, higher-wage jobs and employers that could effectively price potential homebuyers out of purchasing homes, including our homes. If home sales activity or selling prices decline in one or more of our key served markets, including California, Florida, Nevada or Texas, our costs may not decline at all or at the same rate and, as a result, our consolidated financial statements may be materially and adversely affected. Adverse conditions in California would have a particularly material effect on our consolidated financial statements as our average selling price in the state is higher than our average selling prices in the states within our other homebuilding reporting segments, a large percentage of our housing revenues is generated from California, and a significant proportion of our investments in land and land development have been made, and in 2016 are expected to be made, in that state.\nIn recent years, many state, regional and local governments in our served markets have struggled to balance their budgets due to a number of factors. As a result, there have been significant cuts to government departments, subsidies, programs and public employee staffing levels, while taxes and fees have been increased. Lawmakers\u2019 efforts at all governmental levels to address these budget deficit issues and/or efforts to increase governmental revenues, could, among other things, cause businesses and residents to leave, or discourage businesses or households from coming to, affected served markets, thereby limiting economic growth and/or resulting in significant delays and/or higher costs in obtaining required inspections, permits or approvals with respect to the development of our communities located in such markets. These negative impacts could adversely affect our ability to generate orders and revenues and/or to maintain or increase our housing gross profit margins in such markets, and the impact could be material and adverse to our consolidated financial statements.\nNegative environmental impacts from, and legal and regulatory requirements in response to, severe and prolonged drought conditions in Arizona, California and Nevada could adversely affect our business and results of operations in those regions and our consolidated financial statements.\nCertain areas in which we operate, particularly parts of Arizona, California and Nevada, are experiencing extreme or exceptional drought conditions. In response to these conditions and concerns that they may continue for an extended period of time or worsen, government officials have taken, or have proposed taking, a number of steps to preserve potable water supplies. For instance, in 2015, California declared a state of emergency and mandated that local water agencies and other water suppliers achieve specific reductions in potable urban water use through at least February 28, 2016. The state also prohibited irrigation with potable water outside certain newly constructed homes and buildings with landscape areas larger than 2,500 square feet.\nTo address the state\u2019s mandate and their own available potable water supplies, local water agencies/suppliers could potentially restrict, delay the issuance of, or proscribe new water connection permits for homes or businesses; increase the costs for securing such permits, either directly or by requiring participation in impact mitigation programs; adopt higher efficiency requirements for water-using appliances or fixtures; limit or ban the use of water for construction activities; impose requirements as to the types of allowed plant material or irrigation for outdoor landscaping that are more strict than state standards and less desired by consumers; and/or impose fines and penalties for noncompliance with any such measures. These local water agencies/suppliers could also increase rates and charges to residential users for the water they use, potentially increasing the cost of homeownership. We can offer no assurance whether, where and the extent to which these or additional conservation measures might be imposed by local water agencies/suppliers in California or by other federal, state or local lawmakers or regulators in Arizona, California and Nevada. However, if potable water supplies become further constrained due to persistent drought conditions, tighter conservation requirements may be imposed that could limit, impair or delay our ability to acquire and develop land, and/or build and deliver homes (even if we have obtained water connection permits); increase our production costs; or cause the fair value of affected land or land interests in our inventory to decline, which could result in inventory impairment or land option contract abandonment charges, or both; or negatively affect the economies of, or diminish consumer interest in living in, water-constrained areas. These impacts, individually or collectively, could adversely affect our business and consolidated financial statements, and the effect could be material.\nSupply shortages and other risks related to demand for construction resources could increase our costs and delay our deliveries.\nShortages or upward price fluctuations in lumber, drywall, concrete and other building materials, and construction services, whether due to independent subcontractor or outside supplier capacity constraints, heavy residential construction activity, competition with other homebuilders or construction firms, the occurrence of or rebuilding after natural disasters or other reasons, can also have an adverse effect on our business by increasing our production costs and/or extending our production schedules. We may not be able to raise our selling prices to cover such cost increases or delays because of market conditions, including competition for homebuyers from other homebuilders and resale homes. Sustained increases in our production costs due to higher construction resource prices and/or our limited ability to successfully contain these costs may, among other things, decrease our housing gross profit margins, while construction resource shortages due to competition or other factors may delay deliveries of our homes to buyers and our recognition of revenues. As a result, these negative items, individually or together, could have a material and adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nInflation may adversely affect us by increasing costs that we may not be able to recover, particularly if our home selling prices decrease, and the impact on our performance and our consolidated financial statements could be material.\nInflation can have an adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial statements because increasing production costs could require us to increase our home selling prices in an effort to maintain satisfactory housing gross profit margins. However, we may not be able to increase our home selling prices to cover inflation in production costs due to market conditions, and we may need to hold or reduce our selling prices, or offer sales incentives or discounts, in order to compete for home sales. If determined necessary, our lowering of home selling prices and/or using sales incentives or discounts, in addition to impacting our housing gross profit margins, may also reduce the value of our land inventory, including the assets we have purchased in recent years, and make it more difficult for us to fully recover the costs of our land and any related community development through our home selling prices or, if we choose, through land sales. In addition, depressed land values may cause us to abandon and forfeit deposits on land option contracts and other similar contracts if we cannot satisfactorily renegotiate the purchase price of the subject land. We may record charges against our earnings for inventory impairments if the value of our owned inventory, including land we decide to sell, is reduced, or for land option contract abandonments if we choose not to exercise land option contracts or other similar contracts, and these charges may be substantial. Inflation may also increase interest rates for mortgage loans and thereby reduce demand for our homes and lead to lower revenues, as well as increase the interest rates we may need to accept to obtain external financing for our business operations.\nReduced home sales may impair our ability to recoup development costs or force us to absorb additional costs.\nDepending on the stage of development a land parcel is in when acquired, we may incur expenditures for developing land into a community, such as entitling and finishing lots and installing roads, sewers, water systems and other utilities; taxes and other levies related to ownership of the land; constructing model homes; and promotional marketing and overhead expenses to prepare for the opening of the community for home sales. Moreover, local municipalities may impose various and sometimes unanticipated development-related requirements resulting in additional costs or delays. If the rate at which we sell and deliver homes slows or falls, or if our opening of communities for home sales is delayed due to adjustments in our marketing strategy, protracted governmental approval processes or utility service activations, or other reasons, we may incur additional costs, which would adversely affect our housing gross profit margins, and it will take a longer period of time for us to recover our costs. We may also decide to abandon certain land option contracts and other similar contracts, and sell certain land at a loss, and the costs of doing so and any related charges recorded against our earnings may be adverse and material to our consolidated financial statements.\nAn increase in our cancellation rates could negatively impact our business.\nOur backlog at a given point in time reflects homes under a purchase contract that have not yet been delivered to a buyer. Our home purchase contracts with our customers require a relatively small deposit at the time of signing and, in some cases, when design studio options or upgrades are selected. The deposit(s) required vary among markets and communities. Generally, we have the right to retain deposits from customers that cancel their purchase contract. However, we generally permit our customers to cancel their obligations and obtain refunds of all or a portion of their deposits if they cannot obtain a mortgage loan within a certain period of time, and we may choose to provide full or partial refunds in other cases. As a result, if home prices decline, the availability of mortgage financing diminishes or interest rates increase, customers may cancel their existing home purchase contracts with us because they are unable to finalize a mortgage loan for the purchase. In addition, if new home competitors increase their use of sales incentives, lenders and others increase their efforts to sell resale homes through incentives or price cuts, our home construction cycle times are delayed, or there is weakness or a downturn in local or regional economies or the national economy and/or in consumer confidence, customers may cancel, or propose to cancel, their purchase contracts with us because they desire to move into a home earlier than we can deliver it, or in order to attempt to negotiate for a lower selling price or explore other options, or they are otherwise unable or unwilling to complete the purchase. Volatile cancellation rates resulting from these conditions, or otherwise, may reduce the rate at which we sell and deliver homes and could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial statements.\nTax law changes could make home ownership more expensive or less attractive.\nUnder current tax law, significant expenses of owning a home, including mortgage loan interest costs and real estate taxes, generally are deductible expenses for the purpose of calculating an individual\u2019s or household\u2019s federal, and in some cases state, taxable income subject to various limitations. If the federal government or a state government changes its income tax laws by eliminating, limiting or substantially reducing these income tax benefits, the after-tax cost of owning a home could increase substantially. Any increases in personal income tax rates and/or tax deduction limits or restrictions enacted at the federal or state levels could adversely impact demand for and/or selling prices of new homes, including our homes, and the effect on our consolidated financial statements could be adverse and material.\nWe are subject to substantial legal and regulatory requirements regarding the development of land, the homebuilding process and the protection of the environment, which can cause us to suffer production delays and incur costs associated with compliance, and/or prohibit or restrict homebuilding activity in some regions or areas. Our business is also subject to a number of local, state and federal laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, policies and other legal and regulatory requirements. The impact of such requirements or our failure to comply with such requirements, individually or collectively, could be adverse and material to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur homebuilding business is heavily regulated and subject to a significant amount of local, state and federal regulation concerning zoning, allowable housing density, natural and other resource protection, building designs, land/community development and home construction methods, worksite safety and similar matters, as well as governmental taxes, fees and levies on the acquisition and development of land. These regulations often provide broad discretion to government authorities that oversee these matters, which can result in unanticipated delays, adjustments in the allowable scope, size or characteristics, and/or increases in the cost of a specified development project or a number of projects in particular markets. We may also experience delays due to a building permit moratorium or regulatory restrictions in any of the locations in which we operate, which can, among other things, affect the balance of land held for future development in our inventory. Further, there is no assurance that these governmental regulations, or other laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and policies applicable to our business, will not be interpreted or revised in ways that will require us to change our strategies or operations, incur significant compliance costs or\nrecord charges against our earnings, and/or restrict the manner in which we conduct our activities, and any such actions or events, and associated costs and charges, could adversely and materially affect our consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of local, state and federal laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment, including requirements to manage and/or mitigate storm water runoff, dust particles and other environmental impacts of our production activities at our communities. These laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations, and/or evolving interpretations thereof, may cause production delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance, litigation and other costs, and can prohibit or restrict homebuilding activity in certain regions or areas, any of which could also reduce the fair value of affected inventory and require us to record significant impairment charges against our earnings. Environmental laws may also impose liability for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances whether or not the developer or owner of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of those substances. The actual or potential presence of those substances on or nearby our properties may prevent us from selling our homes and we may also be liable, under applicable laws and regulations or lawsuits brought by private parties, for hazardous or toxic substances on land that we have sold in the past. Further, a significant portion of our business is conducted in California, one of the most highly regulated and litigious states in the country. Therefore, our potential exposure to losses and expenses due to new laws, regulations or litigation may be greater than other homebuilders with a less significant California presence.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, legal claims from government and private parties, regulatory investigations and/or proceedings, and significant unfavorable litigation, administrative and arbitral outcomes resulting in losses (including monetary damages awards or other direct or indirect payments to or for the benefit of government or private parties), penalties, fines, injunctions establishing restrictions or adjustments to our business practices, expenses and charges recorded against our earnings (as well as losses, penalties, fines, voluntary injunctions/consent decrees, expenses and charges associated with settlements of any such claims, investigations and proceedings) with respect to our operations in California and those in our other reporting segments. Any such losses, penalties, fines, injunctions, expenses and charges could be beyond our expectations and/or accruals at particular points in time and be material to our business and consolidated financial statements. Unfavorable litigation, administrative or arbitral outcomes may also generate negative publicity in various media outlets that could be detrimental to our reputation and adversely affect our efforts to sell homes.\nThe homebuilding industry and housing market are very competitive, and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or our consolidated financial statements.\nWe face significant competition in several areas of our business from other homebuilders and participants in the overall housing industry, including landlords and other rental housing operators. These competitive conditions can result in:\n\u2022\nour delivering fewer homes;\n\u2022\nour selling homes at lower prices;\n\u2022\nour offering or increasing sales incentives, discounts or price reductions for our homes;\n\u2022\nour experiencing lower housing gross profit margins, particularly if we cannot raise our selling prices to cover increased land acquisition, land/community development, production or overhead costs or inflation;\n\u2022\nour selling fewer homes or experiencing a higher number of cancellations by buyers;\n\u2022\nimpairments in the value of our inventory and other assets;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in acquiring desirable land that meets our investment return or marketing standards, and in selling our interests in land that no longer meet such standards on favorable terms, or at all;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in our obtaining construction resources at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\ndelays in our production schedules; and/or\n\u2022\ndifficulty in securing external financing, performance bonds or letters of credit for our business operations on favorable terms.\nThese competitive conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements by decreasing our revenues, impairing our ability to successfully implement our current strategies, initiatives or actions, increasing our costs and/or diminishing growth in our local or regional homebuilding businesses. During the housing downturn in particular, actions taken by our new home and housing alternative competitors reduced the effectiveness of our efforts to achieve stability or increases in home selling prices, to generate higher deliveries of homes, revenues and housing gross profit margins, and to maintain\nor increase our profitability. We cannot provide any assurance that such conditions and their negative impacts will not occur in 2016 or beyond.\nHomebuilding is subject to warranty and liability claims in the ordinary course of business that can be significant.\nIn the ordinary course of our homebuilding business, we are subject to home warranty and construction defect claims. We record warranty and other liabilities for the homes we deliver based primarily on historical experience in our served markets and our judgment of the risks associated with the types of homes we build. As described in Note 15. Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report, we maintain, and require the majority of our independent subcontractors to maintain, general liability insurance (including construction defect and bodily injury coverage) and workers\u2019 compensation insurance. These insurance policies protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims related to our homebuilding activities, subject to certain self-insured retentions, deductibles and other coverage limits. We self-insure a portion of our overall risk through the use of a captive insurance subsidiary. We also maintain certain other insurance policies. In addition, if we discover improper construction practices or the installation of defective materials in our homes, we will pursue recoveries of the related repair and other costs we incur from potentially responsible parties and/or their or our insurers.\nBecause of the uncertainties inherent to these matters, our various insurance arrangements, recorded warranty and other liabilities and efforts to recover related repair and other costs may not be adequate to address all of our expenditures associated with home warranty and construction defect claims in the future, and any such inadequacies could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, the coverage offered by and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently limited and costly, and, in our case, have relatively high self-insured retentions that limit coverage significantly. Coverage could be further restricted in future periods, increasing our risks and financial exposure to claims, and/or become more costly and to a material degree. Home warranty and construction defect issues may also generate negative publicity in various media outlets that could be detrimental to our reputation and adversely affect our efforts to sell homes.\nWe can provide no assurance that in 2016 we will not face additional home warranty and construction defect claims and/or incur additional related repair and other costs, or not need to record charges against our earnings to adjust our warranty liability, or experience negative publicity/reputational harm or be successful in obtaining any recoveries of related repair and other costs, and that any of these items - if they occur, or with respect to recoveries of related repair and other costs, fail to occur - could, individually or collectively, have a material and adverse impact on our business and consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of the seasonal nature of our business, our quarterly operating results fluctuate.\nAs discussed above in the \u201cCompetition, Seasonality, Delivery Mix and Other Factors\u201d section in this report, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our quarterly operating results that can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Historically, a significant percentage of our home purchase contracts are entered into in the spring and early summer months, and we deliver a corresponding significant percentage of our homes in the late summer and fall months. As a result, we have experienced uneven quarterly results, with generally fewer homes delivered and lower revenues during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year. Though we expect to experience the traditional seasonality impacts on our results as the present housing recovery progresses, we can provide no assurance as to the degree to which such historical seasonal patterns will occur in 2016 and beyond, if at all.\nWe may have difficulty in continuing to obtain additional financing and/or may be restricted in accessing external capital, and to the extent we can access external financing, it may increase our costs of capital or result in stockholder dilution.\nOur homebuilding operations and our present strategies require significant amounts of cash and/or the availability of external financing. We have historically funded our operations with internally generated cash flows, public equity and debt issuances (including common stock, senior notes and convertible senior notes), land option contracts and other similar contracts and land seller financing, and performance bonds and letters of credit. In addition, we have entered into the Credit Facility and the LOC Facilities in order to support certain aspects of our operations in the ordinary course of our business, including land acquisitions, community development and other strategic growth initiatives. We anticipate that we will need to maintain the Credit Facility and the LOC Facilities in 2016, and, if necessary or desirable, we may seek to expand their capacities or enter into additional such facilities, or other similar facility arrangements with the same or other financial institutions. We may also issue additional senior notes, convertible senior notes or equity. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to generate cash flows from our operations or access external financing in 2016 or beyond at favorable terms or at all, or that our stockholders\u2019 equity and ratio of debt to capital will remain at, or further improve from, their respective 2015 year-end levels.\nMarket conditions in 2016 and beyond may significantly limit our ability to replace or refinance indebtedness, in part due to provisions within our outstanding senior notes that may restrict the amount and nature of debt we may incur in the future and the ratings of our senior notes by the three principal nationally recognized registered credit rating agencies, as discussed further below.\nThe terms of potential future issuances of indebtedness by us may be more restrictive than the terms governing our current indebtedness, and the issuance, interest and debt service obligations could be higher. A higher interest rate on or more restrictive terms governing our debt could materially and adversely affect our business and consolidated financial statements. In addition, the relatively low market value of our common stock and volatility in the securities markets could impede our access to the equity markets or increase the amount of dilution our stockholders would experience should we seek to raise capital or complete strategic transactions through the issuance of new equity or convertible securities.\nWhile we believe we can meet our forecasted capital requirements from our cash resources, expected future cash flows from our operations, and the external financing sources that we anticipate will be available to us, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so, or do so without incurring substantially higher costs or significantly diluting existing stockholders\u2019 equity interests. If conditions in the financial and credit markets continue to be volatile or worsen, whether generally, or for homebuilders or us in particular, it could reduce our ability to implement our strategies, initiatives and actions and profitably grow our business. Current and future federal and state regulations limiting the investment activities of financial institutions could also impact our ability to access the capital markets, to obtain additional external financing and/or maintain or, if necessary or desirable, expand the capacities of the Credit Facility or the LOC Facilities or enter into additional such facilities, or other similar facilities, in each case on acceptable terms or at all. The adverse effects of these conditions could be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness in relation to our tangible net worth and unrestricted cash balance, which may restrict our ability to meet our operational and strategic goals.\nThe amount of our debt overall and relative to our total stockholders\u2019 equity and unrestricted cash balance could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, inventory-related investments, strategic transactions, debt service obligations or other business needs, including, but not limited to, supporting our strategic growth initiatives and operational actions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to maintain compliance with the Credit Facility\u2019s financial covenants, or to renew or, if necessary or desirable, expand the capacity of the Credit Facility;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to renew or, if necessary or desirable, expand the capacity of any letter of credit facilities (including the LOC Facilities), or enter into additional facilities, or other similar facilities, and to obtain performance bonds in the ordinary course of our business;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to pay dividends on shares of our common stock;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from our operations to the collateralization or payment of our debt service obligations and reduce our ability to use our cash flows for other purposes, including investments in our business and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nimpact our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to implement our present strategies, particularly our community count expansion initiative, in part due to competition from other homebuilders, developers and investors with greater available liquidity or balance sheet strength;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage because we have more debt or debt-related restrictions than some of our competitors; and\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable in the event of weakness or a downturn in our business or in general economic or housing market conditions.\nOur ability to meet our debt service and other obligations necessary to operate our business in the ordinary course will depend on our future performance. As of the date of this report, our next scheduled maturity of senior notes is on September 15, 2017 with respect to $265.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9.10% senior notes due 2017 (\u201c9.10% Senior Notes due 2017\u201d).\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flows from our operations, and sufficient external financing at a reasonable cost may not be available to us, to meet our debt service obligations and other obligations necessary to operate our business in the ordinary course, comply with the Credit Facility\u2019s financial covenants, or support our letter of credit facilities (including the LOC Facilities). Further, as described in Note 13. Notes Payable in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report, if a change of control were to occur as defined in the instruments governing our senior notes, or if a fundamental change under the terms of our 1.375% convertible senior notes due 2019 (\u201c1.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019\u201d), which includes a change of control, occurs prior to their stated maturity date, we may be required to offer to purchase certain of our senior notes and/or all\nof the convertible senior notes, plus accrued interest and unpaid interest, if any. In such circumstances, if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations, we may, given our unrestricted cash balance, need to refinance and/or restructure with our lenders or other creditors all or a portion of our outstanding debt obligations on or before their maturity, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms or at all, or raise capital through equity or convertible security issuances that could significantly dilute existing stockholders\u2019 interests, and the impact of such circumstances on our liquidity and consolidated financial statements would be material and adverse.\nFailure to comply with the covenants and other requirements imposed by the Credit Facility and the instruments governing our indebtedness could restrict future borrowing or cause any outstanding indebtedness to become immediately due and payable.\nUnder the terms of the Credit Facility, we are required, among other things, to maintain compliance with various covenants, including financial covenants relating to our consolidated tangible net worth, leverage, and interest coverage or liquidity. The Credit Facility is also governed by a borrowing base test and includes a limitation on investments in joint ventures and non-guarantor subsidiaries. Among other things, these covenants and other requirements can influence our operating decisions of whether to enter into, or the manner in which we can structure certain transactions, in order to maintain compliance. If we fail to comply with these covenants and other requirements, the participating financial institutions could terminate the Credit Facility, cause borrowings under the Credit Facility, if any, to become immediately due and payable and/or could demand that we compensate them for waiving instances of noncompliance. In addition, a default under the Credit Facility under certain circumstances or a default under any series of our senior notes or convertible senior notes could cause a default with respect to our other series of such notes and result in the acceleration of the maturity of all of our senior and/or convertible senior notes and our inability to borrow under the Credit Facility, as well as incurring penalties and additional fees, all of which would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and on our consolidated financial statements. Moreover, we may need to curtail our investment activities and other uses of cash to maintain compliance with the covenants and other requirements under the Credit Facility.\nThe indenture governing our outstanding senior notes and convertible senior notes imposes restrictions on our business operations and activities. Though it does not contain any financial covenants, the indenture contains certain restrictive covenants that, among other things and subject to specified exceptions, limit our ability to incur secured indebtedness, to engage in sale-leaseback transactions involving property or assets above a specified value, and, in the case of six series of our outstanding senior notes and our convertible senior notes, to engage in mergers, consolidations, and sales of assets. Due to financial and credit market conditions, we may in the future need to include additional covenants, obligations or restrictions in our indenture or with respect to a specific issuance of securities or to our currently outstanding securities. If we fail to comply with any of these covenants, obligations or restrictions, the holders of our senior notes or convertible senior notes could cause such debt to become due and payable prior to maturity or could demand that we compensate them for waiving instances of noncompliance, and, if they are successful in doing so, the impact on our liquidity and consolidated financial statements would be material and adverse. In addition, a default under any series of our senior notes or convertible senior notes could cause a default with respect to our other series of such notes and result in the acceleration of the maturity of all such defaulted indebtedness and other debt obligations, as well as penalties and additional fees, which would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and consolidated financial statements.\nOur ability to obtain external financing could be adversely affected by a negative change in our credit rating by a third-party rating agency.\nOur access to external financing sources on favorable terms is a key factor in our ability to fund our operations and to grow our business. As of the date of this report, our credit rating by Fitch Ratings is B+, with a stable outlook, our credit rating by Moody\u2019s Investor Services is B2, with a positive outlook, and our credit rating by Standard and Poor\u2019s Financial Services is B, with a stable outlook. Downgrades of our credit rating by any of these principal nationally recognized registered credit rating agencies may make it more difficult and costly for us to access the capital markets and external financing sources, and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and consolidated financial statements.\nWe may not realize our significant deferred income tax assets. In addition, our net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.\nAt November 30, 2015, we had deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $820.0 million, against which we had a valuation allowance of $37.8 million. While we have provided a valuation allowance against certain of our net deferred tax assets, the valuation allowance is subject to adjustment as facts and circumstances change. The accounting for deferred income taxes is based upon estimates of our future results. A housing downturn or other adverse circumstances that negatively affect our future taxable income could require us to record a larger valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as well as related charges against our earnings. Differences between estimated and actual results could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, and the impact may be adverse. Our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets is based on the extent to which we\ngenerate future taxable income, and we cannot provide any assurance as to when and to what extent we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our net deferred tax assets, whether in whole or in any part.\nChanges in tax laws could also affect our actual tax results, the valuation of our net deferred tax assets and our ability to realize our net deferred tax assets. Specifically, a decrease in enacted corporate income tax rates in our major jurisdictions, especially in the federal corporate income tax rate, would decrease the value of our net deferred tax assets and result in a corresponding charge to income tax expense, which could be material, as well as reduce our ability to use our net deferred tax assets.\nIn addition, notwithstanding the reversal of a substantial portion of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance at November 30, 2014, the benefits of our net deferred tax assets, including our net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d), built-in losses and tax credits, would be reduced or potentially eliminated if we experienced an \u201cownership change\u201d under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (\u201cSection 382\u201d). If an ownership change were to occur, Section 382 would impose an annual limit on the amount of NOLs we could use to reduce our taxable income. A number of complex rules apply in calculating this annual limit.\nWhile the complexity of Section 382\u2019s provisions and the limited knowledge any public company has about the ownership of its publicly traded stock make it difficult to determine whether an ownership change has occurred, we currently believe that an ownership change has not occurred. However, if an ownership change were to occur, the annual limit Section 382 may impose could result in a material amount of our NOLs expiring unused. This would significantly impair the value of our net deferred tax assets and, as a result, have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2009, our stockholders approved an amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation that is designed to block transfers of our common stock that could result in an ownership change, and a rights agreement pursuant to which we have issued certain stock purchase rights with terms designed to deter transfers of our common stock that could result in an ownership change. However, these measures cannot guarantee complete protection against an ownership change and it remains possible that one may occur.\nOur cash flows, liquidity and consolidated financial statements could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to obtain performance bonds and/or letters of credit.\nIn the course of developing our communities, we are often required to provide to various municipalities and other government agencies performance bonds and/or letters of credit to secure the completion of our projects and/or in support of obligations to build community improvements such as roads, sewers, water systems and other utilities, and to support similar development activities by certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures. We may also be required to provide performance bonds and/or letters of credit to secure our performance under various escrow agreements, financial guarantees and other arrangements. Our ability to obtain such bonds or letters of credit and the cost to do so depend on our credit rating, overall market capitalization, available capital, past operational and financial performance, management expertise and other factors, including prevailing surety market conditions, and the underwriting practices and resources of performance bond and/or letter of credit issuers. If we are unable to obtain performance bonds and/or letters of credit when required or the cost or operational restrictions or conditions imposed by issuers to obtain them increases significantly in 2016 or beyond, we may not be able to develop or we may be significantly delayed in developing a community or communities, we may be required to post cash collateral, decreasing our unrestricted cash balance, and/or we may incur significant additional expenses. As a result, our business and consolidated financial statements, cash flows and/or liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur ability to attract and retain talent is critical to the success of our business and a failure to do so may materially and adversely affect our performance.\nOur officers and employees are an important resource, and we see attracting and retaining a dedicated and talented team to execute our KBnxt operational business model as crucial to our ability to achieve and maintain an advantage over other homebuilders. We face intense competition for qualified personnel, particularly at senior management levels, from other homebuilders, from other companies in the housing and real estate industries, and from companies in various other industries with respect to certain roles or functions. Moreover, the decline in the market value of our common stock has made it difficult for us to attract and retain talent. If we are unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees, or if we need to significantly increase compensation and benefits to do so (including as a result of complying with health care coverage requirements under the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act of 2010), or, alternatively, if we are required or believe it is appropriate to reduce our overhead expenses through significant personnel reductions or adjustments to compensation and benefits, our performance, our ability to achieve our top strategic priorities and maintain a competitive advantage, and our consolidated financial statements could be materially and adversely affected.\nInformation technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.\nWe use information technology, digital telecommunications and other computer resources to carry out important operational and promotional marketing activities and to maintain our business records. Many of these resources are provided to us and/or maintained on our behalf by third-party service providers pursuant to agreements that specify to varying degrees certain security and service level standards. Although we and our service providers employ what we believe are adequate security, disaster recovery and other preventative and corrective measures, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired if these resources, including our websites or e-mail system, are compromised, degraded, damaged or fail, whether due to a virus or other harmful circumstance, intentional penetration or disruption of our information technology resources by a third party, natural disaster, hardware or software corruption or failure or error or poor product or vendor/developer selection (including a failure of security controls incorporated into or applied to such hardware or software), telecommunications system failure, service provider error or failure, intentional or unintentional personnel actions (including the failure to follow our security protocols), or lost connectivity to our networked resources. A significant and extended disruption in the functioning of these resources, including our websites or e-mail system, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, orders, deliveries of homes and revenues, result in the unintended and/or unauthorized public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary, personal identifying and confidential information (including information about our buyers and business partners), impair the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and require us to incur significant expenses to address and remediate or otherwise resolve these kinds of issues. We may not be able to recover these expenses in whole or in any part from our service providers or responsible parties, and/or their or our insurers. The release of confidential information may also lead to litigation or other proceedings against us by affected individuals, business partners and/or regulators, and the outcome of such proceedings, which could include losses, penalties, fines, injunctions, expenses and charges recorded against our earnings and cause us reputational harm, could have a material and adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements. Depending on its nature, a particular data security breach, penetration or compromise, or a series of breaches, penetrations or compromises, may result in the unauthorized use or loss of our assets or financial resources on a one-time or continuing basis, and such unauthorized use(s) or loss(es), which could be significant, may not be detected for some period of time. In addition, the costs of maintaining adequate protection against data security threats, based on considerations of their evolution, pervasiveness and frequency and/or government-mandated standards or obligations regarding protective efforts, could be material to our consolidated financial statements in a particular period or over various periods.", "PERMNO": 70092, "SIC": 1531, "TIC": "KBH"}
