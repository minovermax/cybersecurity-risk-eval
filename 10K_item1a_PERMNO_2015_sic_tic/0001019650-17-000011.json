{"cik": "1019650", "company": "CENTRUE FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are exposed to higher credit risk by commercial real estate, commercial and industrial lending, real estate construction and farm land.\nCommercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and real estate construction lending usually involve higher credit risks than single-family residential lending. As of December 31, 2016, the following loan types accounted for the stated percentages of our total loan portfolio: commercial real estate - 64.06%, commercial and industrial - 11.71%, real estate construction - 4.20% and farm land - 4.30%.\nCommercial real estate loans may be affected to a greater extent than residential loans by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy because commercial real estate borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans depends on successful development of their properties, in addition to the factors affecting residential real estate borrowers. These loans also involve greater risk because they generally are not fully amortizing over the loan period, but have a balloon payment due at maturity. A borrower\u2019s ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to either refinance the loan or sell the underlying property in a timely manner.\nCommercial and industrial loans are typically based on the borrowers\u2019 ability to repay the loans from the cash flow of their businesses. These loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay each loan depends substantially on the success of the business itself. In addition, the assets securing the loans have the following characteristics: (a) they depreciate over time, (b) they are difficult to appraise and liquidate, and (c) they fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.\nRisk of loss on a real estate construction loan depends largely upon whether our initial estimate of the property\u2019s value at completion of construction equals or exceeds the cost of the property construction (including interest), the availability of permanent take-out financing and the builder\u2019s ability to ultimately sell the property. During the construction phase, a number of factors can result in delays and cost overruns. If estimates of value are inaccurate or if actual construction costs exceed estimates, the value of the property securing the loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed through a permanent loan or by seizure of collateral.\nCommercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and real estate construction loans are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. Our underwriting, review and monitoring cannot eliminate all of the risks related to these loans.\nWe may not be able to retain or develop a strong core deposit base or other low-cost funding sources.\nWe depend on checking, savings and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits as our primary source of funding for our lending activities. Our future growth will largely depend on our ability to retain and grow a strong deposit base. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain core deposits, to obtain third party financing on favorable terms, or to have access to interbank or other liquidity sources, our cost of funds will increase, adversely affecting the ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations, reducing net interest margin and negatively affecting results of operations. We derive liquidity through core deposit growth, maturity of money market investments, and maturity and sale of investment securities and loans. Additionally, we have access to financial market borrowing sources on an unsecured and a collateralized basis for both short-term and long-term purposes including, but not limited to, the Federal Reserve Board and Federal Home Loan Banks, of which we are a member. If these funding sources are not sufficient or available, we may have to acquire funds through higher-cost sources.\nWe are subject to losses due to the errors or fraudulent behavior of employees or third parties.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by employees and outsiders, clerical recordkeeping errors and transactional errors. Our business is dependent on our employees as well as third-party service providers to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions. We could be materially adversely affected if an individual causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems or if one of our third-party service providers experiences an operational breakdown or failure. When we originate loans, we rely upon information supplied by loan applicants and third parties, including the information contained in the loan application, property appraisal and title information, if applicable, and employment and income documentation provided by third parties. If any of this information is misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. Any of these occurrences could result in a diminished ability of us to operate our business, potential liability to customers, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART I\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nWe have a deferred tax asset that may not be fully realized in the future.\nOur net deferred tax asset totaled $35.0 million as of December 31, 2016. The ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods that the related net operating losses and certain recognized built-in losses and net unrealized built-in losses, if any (collectively, \u201cpre-change losses\u201d), may be utilized and is also subject to the rules of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), described below. If our estimates and assumptions about future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies are not accurate, the value of our deferred tax asset may not be recoverable and our cash flow available to fund operations could be adversely affected. It is possible that we could ultimately not be able to use or could lose a portion of the net deferred tax asset.\nOur ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets may be materially impaired if we experience an ownership change under Sections 382 of the Code.\nOur ability to use our deferred tax assets to offset future taxable income will be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. Due to the complexity of Section 382, it is difficult to conclude with certainty at any given point in time whether an \u201cownership change\u201d has occurred. A Company that experiences an ownership change will generally be subject to an annual limitation on the use of its pre-change losses equal to the equity value of the Company immediately before the ownership change (in some cases, reduced by certain capital contributions received in the two years preceding the ownership change), multiplied by the applicable \u201clong-term tax-exempt rate\u201d (a rate that changes monthly and was 2.09% for ownership changes occurring in March 2017). While our certificate of incorporation includes provisions intended to prohibit transactions that would result in an ownership change, an ownership change nevertheless could occur in the future, which likely would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and stockholder value. Any change in applicable law may also result in an ownership change. Our tax preservation provisions may also limit our ability to raise capital by selling newly issued shares of our common stock.\nWe depend on our key officers and employees to continue the implementation of our business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services. Management\u2019s ability to retain key officers and employees may change.\nWe believe that our business strategy and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our current senior management team. We believe our senior management team possesses valuable knowledge about and experience in the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replace. Two members of our senior management team have entered into employment agreements with us, they may not complete the term of their employment agreements or renew them upon expiration. Our success also depends on the experience of our branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve.\nOur future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, financial, technical, marketing, sales and support personnel, particularly in respect of the implementation of our business strategy, which may require the recruitment of new personnel in new or expanded business areas. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions in the geographic markets we serve, and it may be increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. The loss of service of one or more of our key officers and employees, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results and the value of our common stock.\nOur allowance for losses on loans may not be adequate to cover probable incurred losses.\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense. Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when we believe that repayment of principal is unlikely. Any material declines in the creditworthiness of our customers, real estate market conditions and values, general economic conditions or changes in regulatory policies would likely result in a higher probability that principal on some loans will not be repaid and require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. Bank regulators also periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or further loan charge-offs. A material increase in the allowance for loan losses would adversely affect our results of operations and our capital.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART I\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nCentrue Bank\u2019s business is subject to liquidity risk, and changes in its source of funds may adversely affect our performance and financial condition by increasing its cost of funds.\nThe Bank\u2019s ability to make loans and fund expenses is directly related to its ability to secure funding. Retail and commercial deposits and core deposits are the Bank\u2019s primary source of liquidity. The Bank also relies on cash from payments received from loans and investments, as well as advances from the FHLB of Chicago as a funding source.\nPrimary uses of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits, originations of loans and payment of operating expenses. Core deposits represent a significant source of low-cost funds. Alternative funding sources such as large balance time deposits or borrowings are a comparatively higher-cost source of funds. Liquidity risk arises from the inability to meet obligations when they come due or to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding sources. Significant fluctuations in lower cost funding vehicles would cause the Bank to pursue higher cost funding which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s liquidity is largely dependent upon our ability to receive dividends from the Bank, which accounts for substantially all our revenue, could affect our ability to pay dividends, and we may be unable to generate liquidity from other sources.\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank subsidiary. We historically received dividends from the Bank, which we use as the principal source of funds to pay our expenses. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay us. Such limits are also tied to the earnings of the Bank. $2.4 million of the $76.0 million capital raised on March 31, 2015 was retained by the Company for the Company\u2019s use. These retained funds are believed to be sufficient to meet working capital obligations of the Company in the short term, but over time if the Company is unable to receive dividends from the Bank the Company will need an alternative source of working capital funding.\nIncreases in our level of non-performing assets would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf loans that are currently performing become non-performing, we may need to continue to increase our allowance for loan losses if additional losses are anticipated which would have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The increased time and expense associated with the work out of non-performing assets and potential non-performing assets also could adversely affect our operations.\nMaintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services.\nOur success depends, in part, on the ability to adapt products and services to evolving industry and regulatory standards. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. This can reduce net interest income and non-interest income from fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to modify or adapt existing products and services or develop new products and services. We may not be successful in introducing new products and services in response to industry trends or development in technology or those new products may not achieve market acceptance. As a result, we could lose business, be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, or be subject to cost increases.\nDeterioration in the real estate markets and economic conditions could lead to additional losses, which could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on general and local economic conditions, and real estate and business markets in which we do business. The commercial and residential real estate markets experienced weakness during the recent economic downturn. Any future declines in real estate values may reduce the value of collateral securing loans and impact the customer\u2019s ability to borrow or repay. Increases in delinquency levels or declines in real estate values could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nWhile we attempt to manage the risk from changes in market interest rates, interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. In addition, we may not be able to economically hedge our interest rate risk. A rapid or substantial increase or decrease in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest income and results of operations.\nOur earnings and cash flows depend to a great extent upon the level of our net interest income. The amount of interest income is dependent on many factors, including the volume of earning assets, the general level of interest rates, the dynamics of changes in interest rates and the level of non-performing loans. The cost of funds varies with the amount of funds required to support earning assets, the rates paid to attract and hold deposits, rates paid on borrowed funds and the levels of non-interest-bearing demand deposits and equity capital.\nWe are unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond our control including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, domestic and international events, changes in the United States and other financial markets and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the \u201cFederal Reserve Board\u201d). Net interest income is affected by the level and direction of interest rates, credit spreads,\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART I\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nclient loan and deposit preferences and other factors. Additionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, reduce the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans and decrease loan repayment rates. A decrease in the general level of interest rates may affect us through, among other things, increased prepayments on our loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios and increased competition for deposits. Accordingly, changes in the level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest earning assets, loan origination volume, loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios, and our overall results.\nWe attempt to manage our risk from changes in market interest rates through asset/liability management by adjusting the rates, maturity and balances of the different types of interest-earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. Interest rate risk management techniques are not precise and we may not be able to successfully manage our interest rate risk. As a result, a rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our net interest margin and results of operations.\nSince we engage in lending secured by real estate and may be forced to foreclose on the collateral property and own the underlying real estate, we may be subject to the increased costs and risks associated with the ownership of real property, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans, in which case we are exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. The amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including general or local economic conditions; environmental cleanup liabilities; interest rates; real estate taxes; supply and demand for rental units; occupancy rates for rental units and government regulation and fiscal policies. Certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes and maintenance costs, may also adversely affect our operating expenses.\nAn interruption in or breach in security of our information systems may result in a loss of customer business.\nWe rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruptions or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposits, servicing, or loan origination systems. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of information systems used to process customer transactions could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, we outsource portions of our data processing to third parties. If our third party provider encounters difficulties or if we have difficulty in communicating with such third party, it will significantly affect our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions, which would significantly affect our business operations. Furthermore, breaches of such third party\u2019s technology may also cause reimbursable loss to our consumer and business customers, through no fault of our own.\nAlthough management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur regional concentration makes us particularly at risk for changes in economic conditions in our primary market.\nEconomic conditions in Illinois, Missouri, and the Midwest affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects, where adverse economic developments, among other things, could affect the volume of loan originations, increase the level of non-performing assets, increase the rate of foreclosure losses on loans and reduce the value of our loans and loan servicing portfolio. Any regional or local economic downturn that affects Illinois or existing or prospective borrowers or property values in Illinois may affect us and our profitability more significantly and more adversely than our competitors whose operations are less geographically concentrated.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could harm our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhen we sell 1-4 family residential real estate loans we are required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. While we sell mortgage loans with no recourse, our whole loan sale agreements require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans in the event we breach any of these representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud. If the level of repurchase and indemnity activity becomes material, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART I\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nCertain provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation limit our likelihood of being acquired in a manner not approved by the Board.\nOur certificate of incorporation contains provisions intended to protect certain tax attributes of the Company. Unless approved by the board of directors in accordance with the procedures set forth in the certificate of incorporation and subject to certain exceptions for permitted transfers, any attempted transfer of the Company\u2019s common stock is prohibited and void to the extent that, as a result of such transfer (or any series of transfers of which such transfer is a part), either (i) any person or group of persons will own 4.95% or more of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company or (ii) the ownership interest in the Company of any of its existing 5% Stockholders will be increased.\nThe existence of the tax preservation provisions may make it more difficult, delay, discourage, prevent or make it more costly to acquire us or affect a change-in-control that is not approved by the board of directors. This, in turn, could prevent our stockholders from recognizing a gain in the event that a favorable offer is extended and could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nChanges in the valuation of our securities portfolio may impact our profits.\nOur securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and/or earnings. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis, with more frequent evaluation for selected issues. If this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities, a potential loss to earnings may occur. Changes in interest rates can also have an adverse effect on our financial condition, as our available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value, and therefore are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. We increase or decrease our stockholders\u2019 equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities, net of taxes. The declines in market value could result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels.\nOur use of appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan secured by real property does not ensure the value of the real property collateral.\nIn considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, we generally require an appraisal. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made. If the appraisal does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the property, we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. In deciding whether to extend credit, we may rely upon our customers\u2019 representations that their financial statements conform to generally accepted accounting principles and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of the customer. We also may rely on customer representations and certifications, or other audit or accountants\u2019 reports, with respect to the business and financial condition of our clients. Our financial condition, results of operations, financial reporting, and reputation could be negatively affected if we rely on materially misleading, false, inaccurate, or fraudulent information.\nAs a community bank, our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business, and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring, and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers, and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of our employees or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected. Further, negative public opinion can expose us to litigation and regulatory action as we seek to implement our growth strategy.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title.\nIn the course of our business, we may own or foreclose and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART I\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nrequired to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe completion of our pending merger with Midland States Bancorp, Inc. is dependent on a number of factors beyond our control.\nThe success of our pending merger with Midland States, whereby Centrue Financial Corporation would be merged with Midland States Bancorp., Inc. and Centrue Bank would be merged with Midland States Bank, is subject to a number of uncertain factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nobtaining the requisite regulatory approvals in order to consummate the transaction. Midland States Bancorp, Inc. must obtain approvals from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. Other approvals, waivers or consents from regulators may also be required. An adverse development in either party\u2019s regulatory standing or other factors could result in an inability to obtain approval or delay their receipt. These regulators may impose conditions on the completion of the transaction. It is a condition to each company\u2019s obligation to complete the merger that the requisite regulatory approvals be obtained without the imposition of any condition or restriction that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on, or materially and adversely affect the economic benefits to be realized by us (as the surviving corporation of the merger) and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the merger; and\n\u2022obtaining the requisite approval from the shareholders of Centrue Financial Corporation;\nWe and Midland States have operated and, until the completion of the merger, will continue to operate, independently. The success of the merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, will depend, in part, on the ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of our Company into Midland States. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company's ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company's ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger. The loss of key Centrue Bank employees could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business in the markets in which we now operate, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and the value of our common stock. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be business disruptions that cause us and/or Midland States to lose customers or cause customers to close their accounts with us and/or Midland States and move their business to competing financial institutions. Integration efforts between the two companies will also divert management attention and resources. In addition, the actual cost savings of the merger could be less than anticipated.\nWe will incur significant transaction and merger-related costs in connection with the Midland States merger.\nWe expect to continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with completing the Midland States merger. These fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in connection with the Midland States merger.\nAn active, liquid and orderly trading market for our common stock may not develop and the stock price may be volatile.\nSince our common stock is not widely traded, its market value could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various risk factors including: changes in laws or regulations applicable to our industry, products or services; price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market; volatility in the market value and trading volume of companies in our industry or companies that investors consider comparable; share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares; sales of our common stock by us or by our stockholders, including sales as contractual lock-ups expire; litigation involving us or the financial services industry generally; global economic and political changes; competitive activities and loss of customers; catastrophic events; and general economic and market conditions.\nThe cost of additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls in order to satisfy our public company reporting requirements increases our expenses.\nThe obligations of being a public company, include substantial public reporting obligations, which require significant expenditures and place additional demands on our management team. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a stand-alone public company.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART I\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nHowever, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, starting with the second annual report that we will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. In addition, we may need to hire additional compliance, accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical knowledge, and we may not be able to do so in a timely fashion. These obligations will increase our operating expenses and could divert our management\u2019s attention from our operations.\nOur stock-based benefit plans increase our expenses and negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur stock-based benefit plans increase our annual compensation and benefit expenses related to the stock options and stock awards granted to participants under a stock-based benefit plan(s). The actual amount of these new stock-related compensation and benefit expenses depends on the number of options and stock awards actually granted, the fair market value of our stock or options on the date of grant, the vesting period, and other factors which we cannot predict at this time.\nWe recognize expense for our employee stock ownership plan when shares are committed to be released to participants\u2019 accounts, and we recognize expenses for restricted stock awards and stock options over the vesting period of awards made to recipients. Actual expenses depends on the price of our common stock.\nThe implementation of stock-based benefit plans may dilute your ownership interest. Historically, stockholders have approved these stock-based benefit plans.\nOur stock-based benefit plans will dilute the ownership interest in our outstanding shares to the extent newly issued shares are used for the stock-based benefits. Although the implementation of new stock-based benefit plans would be subject to stockholder approval, historically stock-based benefit plans adopted by financial institutions and their holding companies have been approved by stockholders.\n\u201cAnti-takeover\u201d provisions and the regulations to which we are subject may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as regulatory approvals that would be required under federal law, could make it more difficult for a third party to take control of us and may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares of our common stock. These provisions could adversely affect the market value of our common stock and could reduce the amount that stockholders might get if we are sold.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides for, among other things:\nA classified board of directors so that no more than one-third of the directors stand for election in any year;\nLimitations on the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\nThe approval by a super-majority of outstanding shares to approve certain change of control transactions and amend certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws; and\nThe tax preservation provisions of the certificate of incorporation.\nDelaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. We believe that these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board and by providing our board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be determined to be beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board determines is not in the best interest of our stockholders.\nFurthermore, banking laws impose notice, approval and ongoing regulatory requirements on any stockholder or other party that seeks to acquire direct or indirect \u201ccontrol\u201d of an FDIC-insured depository institution. These laws include the Federal Savings and Loan Holding Company Act, the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and the Change in Bank Control Act. These laws could delay or prevent an acquisition.\nA small number of institutional investors, including a stockholder affiliated with one of our directors, owns a significant percentage of our common stock and may vote their shares in a manner that you may consider inconsistent with your best interest or the best interest of our stockholders as a whole.\nCapital Z Partners III, L.P. (\u201cCapital Z\u201d), which is affiliated with one of our directors, currently beneficially owns, in the aggregate, approximately 23.55% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, Capital Z, in its capacity as a stockholder, will have the ability to vote a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock on all matters put to a vote of our stockholders, including the election of our board of directors and certain other significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or acquisition transaction.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART I\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nOn any such matter, the interests of Capital Z may not coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock and any such difference in interests may result in Capital Z voting its shares in a manner inconsistent with the interest of other stockholders of the Company. It is also possible that Capital Z may sell or otherwise dispose of all or a significant portion of the remaining shares it holds which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, accordingly the value of your investment in us may decrease. In addition to Capital Z, two other investment funds that acquired shares of our common stock in our recapitalization own, in the aggregate, approximately 19.54% of our outstanding common stock. The interests of these stockholders may not coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock and these holders may vote their shares in a manner inconsistent with the interest of other stockholders of the Company. These stockholders could also sell or otherwise dispose of all or a significant portion of the shares they hold which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and, accordingly the value of your investment in us may decrease. Capital Z, FJ Capital Management, LLC, and Stieven Capital Advisors, L.P. have made passivity commitments to the Federal Reserve Board with regard to their ownership interest in the Company.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur business may be adversely affected by the slow economic recovery, current conditions in the financial markets, the real estate market and economic conditions generally.\nThe slow economic recovery has continued to result in decreased lending by some financial institutions to their customers and to each other. This has continued to result in a lack of customer confidence, increased market volatility and a widespread reduction in general business activity. Competition among financial institutions for deposits and loans continues to be high, and access to deposits or borrowed funds remains lower than average.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Transactions with other financial institutions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk is likely to be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us. Any losses resulting from such defaults by us, our counterparties or our clients could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nCompetition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in losing business or reducing margins.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes, and continued consolidation. We face aggressive competition from other lending institutions and from numerous other providers of financial services. The ability of non-banking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition. Because non-banking financial institutions are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies, they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures.\nSecurities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions. This may significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business. As a result of these various sources of competition, we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, either of which would adversely affect our profitability.\nWe continually encounter technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Recent Market, Legislative and Regulatory Events\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.\nWe and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and legal requirements that govern almost all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum regulatory capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage, limit the dividends or distributions that the Bank can pay to us, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt, and impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART I\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nmore restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than generally accepted accounting principles. Changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies, including interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, or policies, could affect us adversely, including limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer and/or increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nFederal banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations, and our failure to comply with any supervisory actions to which we are or become subject as a result of such examinations may adversely affect us.\nFederal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board and the IDFPR, periodically conduct examinations and inspections of our business, including compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal or state banking agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we or the Bank or its management were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our or the Bank\u2019s capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against us, our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate the Bank\u2019s deposit insurance.\nExpansion plans may require regulatory approvals, and failure to obtain them may restrict our growth.\nWe must generally receive federal regulatory approval before we can acquire an institution or business. In determining whether to approve a proposed acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on the competition, our financial condition, and our future prospects. The regulators also review current and projected regulatory capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience, and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served (including the acquiring institution\u2019s record of compliance under the Community Reinvestment Act (\u201cCRA\u201d)), the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities, and the existence of any outstanding enforcement actions. Such regulatory approvals may not be granted on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. The failure to obtain required regulatory approvals may impact our business plans and restrict our growth.\nFinancial institutions, such as the Bank, face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Freedom Act of 2015, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements, and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the sanctions programs and rules administered and enforced by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. In order to comply with regulations, guidelines and examination procedures in this area, we have dedicated significant resources to the development of our anti-money laundering program, adopting enhanced policies and procedures and implementing a robust automated anti-money laundering software solution. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we could be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plans.\nWe are subject to the CRA and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nThe CRA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, and restrictions on expansion activity. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART I\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III Capital Rules will increase regulatory capital requirements\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies to establish stricter risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits to apply to banks and certain bank and savings and loan holding companies. In July 2013, the federal banking agencies published the Basel III Capital Rules that revised their risk-based and leverage capital requirements and their method for calculating risk-weighted assets to implement, in part, agreements reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Capital Rules apply to banking organizations, including the Bank. As a small bank holding company (i.e., one with less than $1.0 billion in total assets and meeting certain other criteria), the Basel III Capital Rules do not apply to the Company.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules became effective as applied to the Bank on January 1, 2015, with a phase in period that generally extends from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019. Since the effective date of Basel III the Bank has not experienced any material impact involving the new rules. Subsequent potential rules adjustment by the regulatory governing bodies could still impact the Company or the Bank when they become effective. In 2015, the Bank elected to opt-out of including the impact of certain unrealized capital gains and losses in its calculation of regulatory capital.\nThe fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nThe Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect the net interest margin. The resultant changes in interest rates can also materially decrease the value of certain financial assets we hold, such as debt securities. Its policies can also adversely affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in Federal Reserve Board policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict.\nCENTRUE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nPART I\n(TABLE AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE DATA)", "PERMNO": 84140, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CFCB"}
