{"cik": "1578735", "company": "National General Holdings Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The following discussion of risk factors includes forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in such forward-looking statements. See \u201cNote on Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nIf we are unable to accurately underwrite risks and charge competitive yet profitable rates to our policyholders, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn general, the premiums for our insurance policies are established at the time a policy is issued and, therefore, before all of our underlying costs are known. Like other insurance companies, we rely on estimates and assumptions in setting our premium rates. Establishing adequate premiums is necessary, together with investment income, to generate sufficient revenue to offset losses, LAE and other underwriting costs and to earn a profit. If we do not accurately assess the risks that we assume, we may not charge adequate premiums to cover our losses and expenses, which would negatively affect our results of operations and our profitability. Alternatively, we could set our premiums too high, which could reduce our competitiveness and lead to lower revenues.\nPricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical loss data, and the projection of future trends, loss costs and expenses, and inflation trends, among other factors, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. In order to accurately price our policies, we:\n\u2022collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data from our insureds;\n\u2022develop, test and apply appropriate actuarial projections and rating formulas;\n\u2022closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends; and\n\u2022project both frequency and severity of our insureds\u2019 losses with reasonable accuracy.\nWe seek to implement our pricing accurately in accordance with our assumptions. Our ability to undertake these efforts successfully and, as a result, accurately price our policies, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022insufficient or unreliable data;\n\u2022incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data;\n\u2022uncertainties generally inherent in estimates and assumptions;\n\u2022our failure to implement appropriate actuarial projections and rating formulas or other pricing methodologies;\n\u2022regulatory constraints on rate increases;\n\u2022unexpected escalation in the costs of ongoing medical treatment;\n\u2022our failure to accurately estimate investment yields and the duration of our liability for loss and LAE; and\n\u2022unanticipated court decisions, legislation or regulatory action.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain accurate loss reserves, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts that our insurance subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims, as of the date of the financial statements. The process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both internal and external events, such as: changes in claims handling procedures, adverse changes in loss cost trends, economic conditions (including general inflation), legal trends and legislative changes, and varying judgments and viewpoints in the estimation process, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate loss reserves is difficult to estimate.\nAs a result of these uncertainties, the ultimate paid LAE may deviate, perhaps substantially, from the point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. To the extent that loss and LAE exceed our estimates, we will be required to immediately recognize the unfavorable development and increase loss reserves, with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified. Consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic could materially impact our business, our future results of operations and our overall financial condition.\nIn March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a novel strain of the coronavirus was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The outbreak has become increasingly widespread in the United States, including in the markets in which we operate. Because of the size and breadth of this pandemic, all of the direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 are not yet known and may not emerge for some time.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has had a notable adverse impact on general economic conditions, including adverse impacts on automobile sales and new home sales and increased unemployment, which may decrease customer demand for our insurance products, negatively impact our premium volume, and otherwise adversely impact our future results of operations. For a further discussion of risks that can impact us as a result of an economic downturn, see \u201cGeneral economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business, our liquidity and financial condition.\u201d included in this section.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has caused, and will continue to cause, substantial disruption to our employees, distribution channels and customers through self-isolation, travel limitations, business restrictions, and otherwise. Though most of our employees are able to work remotely, these closures have nevertheless affected many of our customers and certain channels through which we sell our products and services. In addition, an interruption of our system capabilities could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions. Having shifted to remote working arrangements, we also face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents and are more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities. These effects, individually or in the aggregate, could adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, and such adverse impacts may be material.\nThe disruption in the financial markets due to the continuing impact of COVID-19 could result in net realized and unrealized investment losses, including potential impairments in our fixed income portfolio. For further discussion of the risks related to our investment portfolio see \u201cPerformance of our investment portfolio is subject to a variety of investment risks that may adversely affect our financial results.\u201d included in this section. In the event that these market conditions recur or result in a prolonged economic downturn, our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nFederal, state, and local government actions to address and contain the impact of COVID-19 may adversely affect us. For example, regulatory actions seek to retroactively mandate coverage for losses which various types of insurance policies were not designed or priced to cover or seek to require premium refunds. Regulatory restrictions or requirements also impact pricing, risk selection and our rights and obligations with respect to our policies and insureds, including our ability to cancel policies or our right to collect premiums or fees. This may also result in an increased charge for uncollected premium and lower service and fee income. It is also possible that changes in economic conditions and steps taken by federal, state, and local governments in response to COVID-19 could require an increase in taxes at the federal, state, and local levels, which would adversely impact our results of operations.\nAny of the foregoing effects, individually or in the aggregate, or other cascading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could adversely impact our business, operating results and our overall financial condition, and such adverse impacts may be material. The duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted.\nGeneral economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business, our liquidity and financial condition.\nGeneral economic factors beyond our control that affect our business include unemployment rates, consumer spending, residential and commercial real estate prices, U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns, tax rates and policies, changes in interest rates and the availability of credit. Such conditions may potentially affect (among other aspects of our business) the demand for and claims made under our products, the ability of customers, counterparties and others to establish or maintain their relationships with us, our ability to access and efficiently use internal and external capital resources and our investment performance. In the event that these conditions result in a prolonged period of economic uncertainty, our results of operations, our financial condition and/or liquidity, our prospects and competitor landscape could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is dependent on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to attract, train and retain qualified executive officers and key employees, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nOur success has developed from, and will continue to depend on, the efforts of our executive officers because of their industry expertise, knowledge of our markets, and relationships with our independent agents and distribution partners. Should any of our executive officers cease working for us, we may be unable to find acceptable replacements with comparable skills and experience in the specialty P&C and A&H sectors that we target. In addition, our business is also dependent on skilled underwriters and other skilled employees. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract, train and retain, on a timely basis and on anticipated economic and other terms, experienced and capable senior management, underwriters and support staff. We intend to pay competitive salaries, bonuses and equity-based rewards in order to attract and retain such personnel, but we may not be successful in such endeavors. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. We do not currently maintain life insurance policies with respect to our executive officers or other employees.\nRevenues and operating profits from our P&C segment depend on our production in several key states and adverse developments in these key states could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our P&C segment derived 72.7% of its gross premium written from the following ten states: North Carolina (15.9%), California (14.2%), New York (11.8%), Florida (11.6%), Texas (4.0%), Virginia (3.5%), Louisiana (3.4%), Alabama (2.9%), New Jersey (2.9%), and Connecticut (2.5%). As a result, our financial results are subject to prevailing regulatory, legal, economic, demographic, competitive, and other conditions in these states. Adverse developments relating to any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we cannot sustain our business relationships, including our relationships with independent agents, agencies and other parties, we may be unable to compete effectively and operate profitably.\nWe market our products primarily through a network of independent agents and distribution partners. Our relationships with our agents are generally governed by agreements that may be terminated on short notice. Independent agencies generally are not obligated to promote our products and may sell insurance offered by our competitors. As a result, our ability to compete and remain profitable depends, in part, on our maintaining our business relationship with our independent agents and agencies, the marketing efforts of our independent agents and agencies and on our ability to offer insurance products and maintain financial strength ratings that meet the requirements and preferences of our independent agents and agencies and their policyholders.\nIn connection with our lender-placed insurance business, we also have relationships with certain mortgage lenders and servicers, and we insure properties securing mortgages serviced by the mortgage loan servicers with whom we do business. If such lenders terminate important business arrangements with us, or renew contracts on terms less favorable to us, our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely\naffected. For example, in our lender-placed insurance business, restrictions imposed by state regulators on us or by federal regulators on our customers could affect our ability to do business with certain mortgage loan servicers or the volume or profitability of such business. Furthermore, the transfer by mortgage servicer clients of loan portfolios to other carriers or the new participation by other carriers in insuring or reinsuring lender-placed insurance risks could materially reduce our revenues and profits from this business.\nAny failure on our part to be effective in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur affinity channel depends on a relatively small number of affinity partner relationships for a significant percentage of the net premium revenue that it generates, and the loss of one of these significant affinity partner relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur affinity channel operates primarily through relationships with affinity partners, which include major retailers and membership organizations. Our top two affinity relationships collectively represent 63% of our affinity channel written premium. Although our relationships with these and most of our other affinity partners are long-standing with long-term contracts, in the event of the termination of any of our significant affinity partner relationships, our net earned premium could be adversely affected.\nIf we, together with our affiliates and the other third parties that we contract with, are unable to maintain our technology platform or our technology platform fails to operate properly, or we fail to meet the technological demands of our customers with respect to the products and services we offer, our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed.\nWe use our own policy administration system. We also use technology systems to more accurately evaluate specific risk exposures in order to assist us in profitably underwriting our P&C products.\nIf we are unable to properly maintain our policy administration system and other technology systems or if our technology systems otherwise fail to perform in the manner we currently contemplate, our ability to effectively underwrite and issue policies, process claims and perform other business functions could be significantly impaired and our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed. In addition, the success of our business is dependent on our ability to resolve any issues identified with our technology arrangements during operations and make any necessary improvements in a timely manner. Further, we will need to match or exceed the technological capabilities of our competitors over time. We cannot predict with certainty the cost of such integration, maintenance and improvements, but failure to make such improvements could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAlso, we use e-commerce and other technology to provide, expand and market our products and services. Accordingly, we believe that it will be essential to continue to invest resources in maintaining electronic connectivity with customers and, more generally, in e-commerce and technology. Our business may suffer if we do not maintain these arrangements or keep pace with the technological demands of customers.\nIf we experience security breaches or other disruptions involving our technology, our ability to conduct our business could be adversely affected, we could be liable to third parties and our reputation could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is dependent upon the uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunication systems. We rely upon our systems, as well as the systems of our vendors, for all our business operations, including underwriting and issuing policies, processing claims, providing customer service, complying with insurance regulatory requirements and performing actuarial and other analytical functions necessary for underwriting, pricing and product development. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to timely and efficiently maintain and improve our information and telecommunications systems and protect them from physical loss, telecommunications failure or other similar catastrophic events, as well as from security breaches. A shut-down of, or inability to access, one or more of our facilities, a power outage or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on\na timely basis. In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, terrorist attack or industrial accident, or due to a computer virus or other form of cyberattacks, our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time. While we have implemented business contingency plans and other reasonable and appropriate internal controls to protect our systems from interruption, loss or security breaches, a sustained business interruption or system failure could adversely impact our ability to process our business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions.\nOur operations depend on the reliable and secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Computer viruses, hackers, phishing attempts, e-mail fraud, employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches, cyberattacks or other disruptions. In addition, we routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by electronic means. Despite security measures that we have implemented, we cannot assure you that our or third party systems and networks will not be subject to breaches or interference. Any such event may result in operational disruptions, cause payments to be made to an unintended recipient, or result in unauthorized access to or the disclosure or loss of our proprietary information or our customers\u2019 information, which in turn may result in legal claims, regulatory scrutiny and liability, reputational damage, the incurrence of costs to eliminate or mitigate further exposure, the loss of customers or affiliated advisors or other damage to our business. In addition, the trend toward broad consumer and general public notification of such incidents could exacerbate the harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could suffer harm to our business and reputation if attempted security breaches are publicized. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, discovery of new vulnerabilities, attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in our systems, data thefts, physical system or network break-ins or inappropriate access, or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology or other security measures protecting the networks and systems used in connection with our business.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. We are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our clients or employees. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number and change frequently. If any person, including any of our employees or those with whom we share such information, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to our client or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions.\nIf our businesses, including businesses we have acquired, do not perform well, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. We are required to perform goodwill impairment tests at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows. If we determine that the goodwill has been impaired, we would be required to write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income. Such write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIntangible assets represent the amount of fair value assigned to certain assets when we acquire a subsidiary or a book of business. Intangible assets are classified as having either a finite or an indefinite life. We test the recoverability of our intangible assets at least annually. We test the recoverability of finite life intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a finite life intangible may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment if the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value, in which circumstances we must write down the intangible asset by the amount of the impairment with a corresponding charge to net income. We own two management companies that are attorneys-in-fact for two reciprocal exchanges. If the reciprocal business does not perform well or the reciprocal exchanges are downgraded, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our intangible assets. Such write downs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA downgrade in the A.M. Best rating of our insurance subsidiaries would likely reduce the amount of business we are able to write and could materially adversely impact the competitive positions of our insurance subsidiaries.\nRating agencies evaluate insurance companies based on their ability to pay claims. A.M. Best has currently assigned our insurance subsidiaries a group rating of \u201cA-\u201d (Excellent). On July 9, 2020, following the announcement of our agreement to be acquired by Allstate, A.M. Best placed us and our subsidiaries under review with positive implications. The ratings of A.M. Best are subject to periodic review using, among other things, proprietary capital adequacy models, and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. Our competitive position relative to other companies is determined in part by the A.M. Best rating of our insurance subsidiaries. A.M. Best ratings are directed toward the concerns of policyholders and insurance agencies and are not intended for the protection of investors or as a recommendation to buy, hold or sell securities.\nThere can be no assurances that our insurance subsidiaries will be able to maintain their current ratings. Any downgrade in ratings would likely adversely affect our business through the loss of certain existing and potential policyholders and the loss of relationships with independent agencies that might move to other companies with higher ratings. We are not able to quantify the percentage of our business, in terms of premiums or otherwise, that would be affected by a downgrade in our A.M. Best ratings.\nPerformance of our investment portfolio is subject to a variety of investment risks that may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur results are affected, in part, by the performance of our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive investments, such as fixed-income securities. As of December 31, 2020, our investment in fixed-income securities was approximately $4,497.1 million, or 90.5% of our total investment portfolio. Increases in market interest rates may have an adverse impact on the value of our investment portfolio by decreasing the value of fixed-income securities. Conversely, declining market interest rates could have an adverse impact on our investment income as we invest positive cash flows from operations and as we reinvest proceeds from maturing and called investments in new investments that could yield lower rates than our investments have historically generated. Defaults in our investment portfolio may produce operating losses and adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur investment portfolio also contains floating rate instruments, which typically bear interest based on LIBOR. Regulatory and industry initiatives to eliminate LIBOR as an interest rate benchmark may create uncertainty in our LIBOR-based instruments, which may adversely impact both pricing and liquidity of such instruments.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to manage interest rate sensitivity effectively. Despite our efforts to maintain a high quality portfolio and manage the duration of the portfolio to reduce the effect of interest rate changes, a significant change in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the performance of our investment portfolio generally is subject to other risks, including the following:\n\u2022the risk of decrease in value due to a deterioration in the financial condition, operating performance or business prospects of one or more issuers of our fixed-income securities;\n\u2022the risk that our portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors or industries;\n\u2022the risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on a timely basis; and\n\u2022general movements in the values of securities markets.\nIf our investment portfolio were to suffer a substantial decrease in value due to market, sector or issuer-specific conditions, our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. A decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary\u2019s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary\u2019s ability to write new business.\nOur holding company structure and certain regulatory and other constraints, including adverse business performance, could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations.\nWe are a holding company and conduct our business operations through our various subsidiaries. Our principal sources of funds are dividends and other payments from our insurance subsidiaries and other operating subsidiaries, income from our investment portfolio and funds that may be raised from time to time in the capital markets. We will be largely dependent on amounts from our insurance subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on any indebtedness that we may incur, to pay holding company operating expenses, to make capital investments in our other subsidiaries and to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock. In addition, our credit agreement contains covenants that limit our ability to pay cash dividends to our stockholders under certain circumstances.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions imposed on insurance companies by their states of domicile, which limit the amount of cash dividends or distributions that they may pay to us unless special permission is received from the insurance regulator of the relevant domiciliary state. In general, the maximum amount of dividends that US-domiciled insurance subsidiaries may pay in any 12-month period without regulatory approval is the greater of adjusted statutory net income or 10% of statutory policyholders\u2019 surplus as of the preceding calendar year end. Adjusted statutory net income is generally defined for this purpose to be statutory net income, net of realized capital gains, for the calendar year preceding the date of the dividend. In addition, other states may limit or restrict our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay stockholder dividends generally or as a condition to issuance of a certificate of authority. The aggregate amount of cash dividends and distributions that could be paid by our insurance subsidiaries without prior approval by the various domiciliary states of our insurance subsidiaries was approximately $156.4 million as of December 31, 2020, taking into account dividends paid in the prior twelve month period.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements. Our failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action.\nThe laws of the states of domicile of our insurance subsidiaries impose risk-based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements. Failure to meet applicable risk-based capital requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements could subject us to further examination or corrective action imposed by state regulators, including limitations on our writing of additional business, state supervision or liquidation. Any changes in existing risk-based capital requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements may require us to increase our statutory capital levels, which we may be unable to do. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Regulation - State Insurance Regulation - Financial Oversight-Risk-Based Capital Regulations.\u201d\nThe insurance industry is subject to extensive regulation, which may affect our ability to execute our business plan and grow our business.\nWe are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in each of the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or commercially domiciled, as well as all states in which they are licensed, sell insurance products, issue policies, or handle claims. Some states impose restrictions or require prior regulatory approval of specific corporate actions, which may adversely affect our ability to operate, innovate, obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner or grow our business profitably. These regulations provide safeguards for policyholders and are not intended to protect the interests of stockholders. Our ability to comply with these laws and regulations, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is, and will continue to be, critical to our success. Some of these regulations include:\n\u2022Required Licensing. We operate under licenses issued by the insurance department in the states in which we sell insurance. If a regulatory authority denies or delays granting a new license, our ability to enter that market quickly or offer new insurance products in that market may be substantially impaired. In addition, if the insurance department in any state in which we currently operate suspends, non-renews, or revokes an existing license, we would not be able to offer affected products in that state.\n\u2022Transactions Between Insurance Companies and Their Affiliates. Transactions between us or other of our affiliates and our insurance companies generally must be disclosed, and prior approval is required before any material or extraordinary transaction may be consummated. Approval may be refused or the time required to obtain approval may delay some transactions, which may adversely affect our ability to innovate or operate efficiently.\n\u2022Regulation of Insurance Rates and Approval of Policy Forms. The insurance laws of most states in which we conduct business require insurance companies to file insurance rate schedules and insurance policy forms for review and approval. If, as permitted in some states, we begin using new rates before they are approved, we may be required to issue refunds or credits to the policyholders if the new rates are ultimately deemed excessive or unfair and disapproved by the applicable insurance department. In most of the states in which we operate, prior approval of rate changes is required and there may be long delays in the approval process or the rates may not be approved. Accordingly, our ability to respond to market developments or increased costs in that state could be adversely affected and our ability to operate in a profitable manner may be limited.\n\u2022Restrictions on Cancellation, Non-Renewal or Withdrawal. Many of the states in which we operate have laws and regulations that limit our ability to exit a market. For example, some states limit a private passenger auto insurer\u2019s ability to cancel and refuse to renew policies and some prohibit insurers from withdrawing one or more lines of insurance business from the state unless prior approval is received. In some states, these regulations extend to significant reductions in the amount of insurance written, not just to a complete withdrawal. Laws and regulations that limit our ability to cancel and refuse to renew policies in some states or locations and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable markets, which may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Lender-placed insurance products. State departments of insurance and regulatory authorities may choose to review the appropriateness of our premium rates for our lender-placed insurance products. If the reviews by state departments of insurance lead to significant decreases in premium rates for our lender-placed insurance products, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022Other Regulations. We must also comply with regulations involving, among other matters:\n\u2022the use of non-public consumer information and related privacy issues;\n\u2022the use of credit history in underwriting and rating policies;\n\u2022limitations on the ability to charge policy fees;\n\u2022limitations on types and amounts of investments;\n\u2022restrictions on the payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries;\n\u2022the acquisition or disposition of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company;\n\u2022involuntary assignments of high-risk policies, participation in reinsurance facilities and underwriting associations, assessments and other governmental surcharges for guaranty funds, second-injury funds, catastrophe funds and other mandatory pooling arrangements;\n\u2022reporting with respect to financial condition; and\n\u2022periodic financial and market conduct examinations performed by state insurance department examiners.\nThe failure to comply with these laws and regulations may also result in regulatory actions, fines and penalties, and in extreme cases, revocation of our ability to do business in a particular jurisdiction. In the past we have been fined by state insurance departments for failing to comply with certain laws and regulations. In addition, we may face individual and class action lawsuits by insured and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations.\nOur failure to accurately and timely pay claims could adversely affect our business, financial results and liquidity.\nWe must accurately and timely evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies. Many factors affect our ability to pay claims accurately and timely, including the training and experience of our claims representatives, our claims department\u2019s culture and the effectiveness of our management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support our claims functions and other factors. Our failure to pay claims accurately and timely could lead to material litigation, undermine our reputation in the marketplace and materially adversely affect our financial results and liquidity.\nIn addition, if we do not train new claims employees effectively or lose a significant number of experienced claims employees, our claims department\u2019s ability to handle an increasing workload could be adversely affected. In addition to potentially requiring that growth be slowed in the affected markets, our business could suffer from decreased quality of claims work which, in turn, could lower our operating margins.\nReform of the health insurance industry could materially reduce the profitability of our A&H segment.\nThe PPACA was signed into law in 2010. In recent years there have been several judicial and congressional challenges and proposed amendments to PPACA, and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 repealed certain aspects of the PPACA. Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or replace elements of the PPACA.\nDue to the complexity and continued uncertainty surrounding healthcare legislation, the impact from the PPACA or any amendments to the PPACA remains difficult to predict and could significantly affect the health insurance industry. We continue to review our product offerings and make changes to adapt to the current environment and the opportunities presented. However, we could be adversely affected if our plans for operating in the current environment are unsuccessful or if there is less demand than we expect for our A&H products.\nIf we are unable to adapt our A&H business to current and/or future requirements of the PPACA, or if significant uncertainty continues with respect to implementation of the PPACA or other healthcare reform legislation, our A&H business could be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, should Congress extend the scope of or repeal parts of or all of the PPACA, such a development could have a material adverse effect on our A&H business. For more information on the PPACA and its impact on our A&H segment, see Item 1, \u201cBusiness - A&H Segment.\u201d\nOur operations and business activities outside of the United States are subject to a number of risks, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently conduct a limited amount of business outside the United States, primarily in Bermuda. In this jurisdiction, we are subject to a number of significant risks in conducting such business. These risks include restrictions such as capital controls and other restrictive government actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our reputation. Investments outside the United States also subject us to additional domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in other countries that prohibit the making of improper payments to foreign officials. In addition, some countries have laws and regulations that lack clarity and, even with local expertise and effective controls, it can be difficult to determine the exact requirements of the local laws. Failure to comply with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our business in that market but also on our reputation generally.\nChanges in accounting standards issued by the FASB or other standard-setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the FASB. The anticipated impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is\ndisclosed in our reports filed with the SEC. See Note 2, \u201cSignificant Accounting Policies,\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. An assessment of proposed standards, including standards on insurance contracts and accounting for financial instruments, is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and official positions of the FASB are determined only after extensive due process and deliberations. Therefore, the effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. The required adoption of future accounting standards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, including on our net income.\nRisks Relating to Our Insurance Operations\nThe insurance industry is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively against larger companies.\nThe insurance industry is highly competitive and, except for regulatory considerations, there are relatively few barriers to entry. We compete with both large national insurance providers and smaller regional companies on the basis of price, coverages offered, claims handling, customer service, agent commissions, geographic coverage and financial strength ratings. Some of our competitors have more capital, higher ratings and greater resources than we have, and may offer a broader range of products than we offer.\nMany of our competitors invest heavily in advertising and marketing efforts and/or expanding their online service offerings. Many of these competitors have better brand recognition than we have and have a significantly larger market share than we do. As a result, these larger competitors may be better able to offer lower rates to consumers, to withstand larger losses, and to more effectively take advantage of new marketing opportunities. Our ability to compete against these larger competitors depends on our ability to deliver superior service and maintain our relationships with independent agents, distribution partners and affinity groups.\nIn our lender-placed insurance business, we use a proprietary insurance-tracking system to monitor the clients\u2019 mortgage portfolios to verify the continuation of insurance on each mortgaged property. If, in addition to our current competitors, others in this industry develop a competing system or equivalent administering capabilities, this could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe write a significant amount of business in the nonstandard auto insurance market, which could make us more susceptible to unfavorable market conditions which have a disproportionate effect on that customer base.\nA significant amount of our P&C premium currently is written in the nonstandard auto insurance market. As a result, adverse developments in the economic, competitive or regulatory environment affecting the nonstandard customer base or the nonstandard auto insurance industry in general may have a greater effect on us as compared to a more diversified auto insurance carrier with a larger percentage of its business in other types of auto insurance products. Adverse developments of this type may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe generate significant revenue from service fees generated from our P&C and A&H policyholders, which could be adversely affected by additional insurance or consumer protection regulation.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we generated $760.4 million in service and fee revenue from our P&C and A&H policyholders, which included, among others, origination fees, installment fees relating to installment payment plans, late payment fees, policy cancellation fees and reinstatement fees. The revenue we generate from these service fees could be reduced by changes in consumer protection or insurance regulation that restrict or prohibit our ability to charge these fees. If our ability to charge fees for these services were to be restricted or prohibited, there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain rate increases or take other action to offset the lost revenue and the direct and indirect costs associated with providing the services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe insurance industry is cyclical in nature, which may affect our overall financial performance.\nHistorically, the financial performance of the insurance industry has tended to fluctuate in cyclical periods of price competition and excess capacity (known as a soft market) followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity (known as a hard market). The profitability of most insurance companies tends to follow this cyclical market pattern. We cannot predict with certainty the timing or duration of changes in the market cycle because the cyclicality is due in large part to the actions of our competitors and general economic factors beyond our control. These cyclical patterns, the actions of our competitors, and general economic factors could cause our revenues and net income to fluctuate, which may adversely affect our business.\nCatastrophic losses or the frequency of smaller insured losses may exceed our expectations as well as the limits of our reinsurance, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur P&C insurance business is subject to claims arising from catastrophes, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, floods, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, and fires, non-catastrophic weather and water losses or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, and hazardous material releases. The incidence and severity of such events are inherently unpredictable, and our losses from catastrophes could be substantial.\nLonger-term weather trends are changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that may be associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, including effects on global weather patterns, sea, land and air temperature, sea levels, rain and snow. Climate change could increase the frequency and severity of catastrophe losses we experience in both coastal and non-coastal areas.\nIn addition, it is possible that we may experience an unusual frequency of smaller losses in a particular period. In either case, the consequences could be substantial volatility in our financial condition or results of operations for any fiscal quarter or year, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and our ability to write new business. For example, our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2020, have been negatively impacted by losses resulting from severe weather-related events. Losses related to P&C weather-related events, excluding the Reciprocal Exchanges, were $150.2 million in 2020, compared to $51.2 million in 2019, an increase of $99.0 million year over year. Although we believe that our geographic and product mix creates limited exposure to catastrophic events and we attempt to manage our exposure to these types of catastrophic and cumulative losses, including through the use of reinsurance, catastrophic events are inherently unpredictable and the severity or frequency of these types of losses may exceed our expectations as well as the limits of our reinsurance coverage.\nWe rely on the use of credit scoring in pricing and underwriting our auto insurance policies and any legal or regulatory requirements which restrict our ability to access credit score information could decrease the accuracy of our pricing and underwriting process and thus lower our profitability.\nWe use credit scoring as a factor in pricing and underwriting decisions where allowed by state law. Consumer groups and regulators have questioned whether the use of credit scoring unfairly discriminates against some groups of people and are calling for laws and regulations to prohibit or restrict the use of credit scoring in underwriting and pricing. Laws or regulations that significantly curtail or regulate the use of credit scoring, if enacted in a large number of states in which we operate, could impact the integrity of our pricing and underwriting process, which could, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and make it harder for us to be profitable over time.\nIf market conditions cause our reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable, we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.\nAs part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase excess of loss catastrophic and casualty reinsurance for protection against catastrophic events and other large losses. We also rely on quota share insurance agreements to cede a portion of the risk on the policies that we write. Market conditions beyond our\ncontrol, in terms of price and available capacity, may affect the amount of reinsurance we acquire and our profitability.\nWe may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance arrangements or to obtain other reinsurance in adequate amounts and at favorable rates. Increases in the cost of reinsurance would adversely affect our profitability. In addition, if we are unable to renew our expiring arrangements or to obtain new reinsurance on favorable terms, either our net exposure to risk would increase, which would increase our costs, or, if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net risk exposures, we would have to reduce the amount of risk we underwrite, which would reduce our revenues.\nWe may not be able to recover amounts due from our reinsurers, which would adversely affect our financial condition.\nReinsurance does not discharge our obligations under the insurance policies we write; it merely provides us with a contractual right to seek reimbursement on certain claims. The applicable insurance company remains liable to our policyholders even if we are unable to make recoveries that we are entitled to receive under our reinsurance contracts. As a result, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. Losses are recovered from our reinsurers after underlying policy claims are paid. The creditworthiness of our reinsurers may change before we recover amounts to which we are entitled. Therefore, if a reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations to us, we would be responsible for claims and claim settlement expenses for which we would have otherwise received payment from the reinsurer. If we were unable to collect these amounts from our reinsurers, our costs would increase and our financial condition would be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate amount of approximately $1,218.9 million of reinsurance recoverable, net of the allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance.\nOur largest reinsurance recoverables are from the North Carolina Reinsurance Facility (\u201cNCRF\u201d) and the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (\u201cMCCA\u201d). The NCRF is a non-profit organization established to provide automobile liability reinsurance to those insurance companies that write automobile insurance in North Carolina. The MCCA is a Michigan reinsurance mechanism that covers no-fault first party medical losses of retentions in excess of $0.6 million in 2020. At December 31, 2020, the amount of reinsurance recoverable from the NCRF and the MCCA was approximately $193.3 million and $545.7 million, respectively. If any of our principal reinsurers were unable to meet its obligations to us, our financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nThe effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain and negative developments in this area could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAs industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until after we have issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of our liability under an insurance policy may not be known until many years after the policy is issued. For example, medical costs associated with permanent and partial disabilities may increase more rapidly or be higher than we currently expect. Changes of this nature may expose us to higher claims than we anticipated when we wrote the underlying policy. Unexpected increases in our claim costs many years after policies are issued may also result in our inability to recover from certain of our reinsurers the full amount that they would otherwise owe us for such claims costs because certain of the reinsurance agreements covering our business include commutation clauses that permit the reinsurers to terminate their obligations by making a final payment to us based on an estimate of their remaining liabilities. In addition, the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue, to remove limitations on recovery, to deem by statute the existence of a covered occurrence, to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business. The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict and could be harmful to our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe effects of litigation on our business are uncertain and could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may from time to time be subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our current and past business operations including, but not limited to, disputes over coverage or claims adjudication, including claims alleging that we have acted in bad faith in the administration of claims by our policyholders, disputes with our agents or producers over compensation and termination of contracts and related claims, disputes relating to certain business acquired or disposed of by us and disputes with former employees. We also cannot determine with any certainty what new theories of recovery may evolve or what their impact may be on our business.\nClass action claims present additional exposure to substantial economic, non-economic or punitive damage awards. The loss of even one of these claims, if it results in a significant damage award or a judicial ruling that was otherwise detrimental, could create a precedent in the industry that could have an adverse effect on our business.", "PERMNO": 14464, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "NGHC"}
