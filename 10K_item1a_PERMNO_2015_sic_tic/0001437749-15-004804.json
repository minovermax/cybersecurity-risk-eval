{"cik": "1460198", "company": "Kips Bay Medical, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following information about risks, together with the other information contained in this report before making an investment in our common stock. If any of the circumstances or events described below actually arises or occurs, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Strategy\nWe have a limited operating history, expect future losses, and may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe were founded on May 1, 2007 and to date have engaged primarily in the development of and initial clinical trials of our eSVS Mesh. Accordingly, we have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $41.5 million. We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. These losses, among other things, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing medical devices, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all. To date, we have not generated sufficient product sales to fund our operations and we have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through public common stock offerings completed in January 2014, December 2012 and February 2011 and private placements of equity securities and convertible promissory notes. We may not be successful in addressing the risks we will encounter, and our failure to do so would likely harm our business and our ability to continue to operate.\nIf the data from our current eMESH I clinical feasibility trial is not positive enough for us to proceed with our planned pivotal trial, we likely will cease operations and liquidate our company, which will likely result in our stockholders losing their entire investment in our company.\nWe are currently conducting a feasibility trial for the FDA. This trial is a multi-center, randomized study of external saphenous vein support using our eSVS Mesh in CABG surgery and is titled the \u201ceMESH I\u201d clinical feasibility trial. The objective of this trial is to demonstrate the initial safety and performance of the eSVS Mesh for use as an external saphenous vein graft support device during CABG surgery and to support a future pivotal trial. The pivotal study is required to demonstrate clinical effectiveness and support a premarket approval application filing with the FDA seeking approval to sell the eSVS Mesh in the United States. Patients in the eMESH I clinical feasibility trial will be followed through hospital discharge, with additional follow-up visits at 30 days, three months, six months, one year and yearly thereafter through five years. However, only the results through the six-month follow-up visit will be submitted to the FDA as part of an application for an IDE to conduct a pivotal trial in the United States.\nIn March 2014, the FDA approved a combination of changes in the application of the eSVS Mesh to the SVG and to the surgical implant technique for the eSVS Mesh treated graft. These changes were based upon our consultations with medical advisors and several of the cardiac surgeons participating in the eMESH I clinical feasibility trial and our initial review of early results from the eMESH I trial. The changes are intended to reduce the variables in the study and the risk of early graft occlusion. We also believe these changes will simplify the process of applying and implanting the eSVS Mesh thereby reducing procedural costs. No assurance can be provided, however, that these changes will reduce the variables in the study and the risk of early graft occlusion or that the feasibility trial for the FDA will be successful. Due to our concern that the results of our feasibility trial prior to the change in the implant technique would not be adequate to allow us to obtain an IDE to perform a pivotal study and based upon our discussions with the FDA, we believe that the success of the feasibility trial is completely dependent upon the results from patients implanted with the eSVS Mesh using the new implant technique. Since enrollment using the new implant technique did not commence in earnest until October 2014, we do not expect to receive a meaningful number of follow-up angiographic results from the new implant technique patients until May or June 2015.\nEnrollment in the eMESH I clinical feasibility trial has reached our targeted goal of 45 to 50 patients treated with the new surgical technique. As of March 5, 2015, 105 patients have been enrolled in the feasibility trial, including 49 patients enrolled with the new technique. No assurance can be provided that our eMESH I clinical feasibility trial will be successful, that the FDA will approve an IDE for a pivotal study or that once these studies are concluded, we will receive U.S. marketing approval for the eSVS Mesh. If these events do not occur, we may be forced to cease operations since we do not have any other products in development. In addition, we will need additional financing to continue our operations, and in particular, to complete our eMESH I clinical feasibility trial. If we do not receive such additional financing, we may be forced to cease operations and liquidate our company. If a decision is made to cease operations and liquidate our company our stockholders likely will lose their entire investment in our company.\nOur data from our clinical trials may not be sufficient for us to proceed with our planned filing of our pre-market application for regulatory approval in the United States or application for regulatory approval in other major markets, which could delay or curtail our ability to commercialize our eSVS Mesh and could curtail our ability to remain in business.\nOur time and financial resources since our inception have largely been devoted to the development of our eSVS Mesh. We are currently conducting a feasibility trial for the FDA. If the data from our eMESH I clinical feasibility trial is not adequate, we may not proceed with our planned future pivotal trial and the future filing of our pre-market application for regulatory approval in the United States or for regulatory approvals in other major markets in which the application is dependent upon us having received regulatory approval from the United States, or we may be forced to delay these filings. Even if we file an application for approval with favorable clinical data, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may not accept our filing, or may request additional information, including data from additional clinical trials. No assurance can be provided that our current feasibility trial or our anticipated larger pivotal trial will be successful, or that once these studies are concluded, we will ever receive U.S. marketing approval for our eSVS Mesh. We have no other products ready for clinical testing or commercialization; therefore, our ability to remain in business would be doubtful if our eSVS Mesh is not proven to be safe and effective. If our current feasibility trial or our anticipated larger pivotal trial is not successful, we may need to consider other strategic alternatives, including ceasing our operations and liquidating our company. If a decision is made to cease operations and liquidate our company, our stockholders likely will lose their entire investment.\nThe results of our initial human trial were inconclusive with respect to the efficacy of our eSVS Mesh and if we are unable to conclusively demonstrate the efficacy of our eSVS Mesh through additional human trials, including our current feasibility trial or anticipated future pivotal trial, we may be unable to commercialize our eSVS Mesh in the United States or other major markets or may experience significant delays in doing so.\nWe have only completed one prospective, randomized, human clinical trial of 90 patients for our eSVS Mesh, which was conducted outside of the United States. The safety data from this trial has indicated that our eSVS Mesh and implant procedure do not result in an increase in patient complications during or in the 30 days after surgery. However, the effectiveness data from the trial is inconclusive primarily due to two complicating factors. First, one of the centers participating in the trial used implant methods incompatible with our eSVS Mesh. Second, the amount of reduction in the diameter of the saphenous vein grafts, or downsizing, prescribed in our instructions for use and sizing tool was too aggressive, resulting in a higher than anticipated closure rate in saphenous vein grafts, or SVGs, utilizing our eSVS Mesh, particularly when our smallest device, 3.0 millimeters, was used. As a result, based on angiographic studies nine to 12 months following surgery, 49% (36 of 73) of the eSVS Mesh vessels were patent, or open, and 81% (59 of 73) of the untreated vessels were patent.\nNo assurance can be provided that our current feasibility trial or our anticipated larger pivotal trial will be successful, or that once these studies are concluded, we will ever receive U.S. marketing approval for our eSVS Mesh. Due to our concern that the results of our feasibility trial prior to the change in the implant technique would not be adequate to allow us to obtain an IDE to perform a pivotal study and based upon our discussions with the FDA, we believe the success of the feasibility trial is entirely dependent upon the performance of our eSVS Mesh in the new technique patients. If we are unable to demonstrate with human clinical data that our eSVS Mesh is safe and improves the long-term patency of saphenous vein grafts as compared to traditional CABG surgery, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our eSVS Mesh in the United States or in other countries which require us to first obtain FDA approval. We have no other products ready for clinical testing or commercialization; therefore, our ability to remain in business would be doubtful if our eSVS Mesh is not proven to be safe and effective. If our current feasibility trial or our anticipated larger pivotal trial is not successful, we may need to consider other strategic alternatives, including ceasing operations and liquidating our company. If a decision is made to cease operations and liquidate our company, our stockholders likely will lose their entire investment in our company.\nOur sales of the eSVS Mesh to date have been limited and we expect sales to continue to be limited until additional positive clinical study data is available.\nOur sales of the eSVS Mesh to date have been limited and we do not expect them to increase in the near future, especially since we have focused our efforts on clinical activities and not sales activities. Our net sales for the full year 2014 were $84,000 compared to $130,000 for the full year 2013. We believe that our sales have been adversely impacted by the limited amount of clinical data on the performance of the eSVS Mesh, limited reimbursements available to hospitals and the effects of budget difficulties in certain European countries. We do not expect our sales to be other than limited until additional positive clinical study data is available. If we do not receive additional positive clinical study data, then we may need to cease our sales activities and consider other strategic alternatives, including ceasing operations and liquidating our company.\nWe anticipate future losses and likely will require additional financing. Our failure to obtain additional financing when needed could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future and to require future additional financing in order to satisfy our capital requirements. In particular, we will need additional capital in order to continue to conduct the research and development and obtain regulatory clearances and approvals necessary to bring our eSVS Mesh to market in the United States and any future products to market and to establish effective marketing and sales capabilities for our eSVS Mesh or any future products. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2014 will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through December 2015. However, we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to continue our feasibility trial for the FDA and plan for and conduct our anticipated larger pivotal trial.\nWe may seek to raise additional funds through various sources, such as equity and debt financings, or through strategic collaborations and license agreements. We can give no assurances that we will be able to secure additional sources of funds to support our operations, or if such funds are available to us, that such additional financing will be sufficient to meet our needs or on terms acceptable to us. This is particularly true if investors are not confident in the future value of our company, the continued trading of our common stock on the OTCQB marketplace of the OTC Markets Group and/or economic and market conditions deteriorate. If adequate funds are not available on a timely basis, we may terminate or delay the further development of our eSVS Mesh and terminate commercial sales of the eSVS Mesh. If we terminate the commercialization of our eSVS Mesh, Medtronic, Inc. may cause the core intellectual property and patent rights related to our eSVS Mesh to revert to Medtronic. If the core intellectual property and patent right related to our eSVS Mesh revert to Medtronic or if we terminate the development of our eSVS Mesh, we may be forced to explore other strategic alternatives, such as selling or merging our company or ceasing operations and liquidating our company. In such case, our stockholders could lose some or all of their investment in our company.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nthe progress of clinical trials required to support our applications for regulatory approvals, including our human clinical trials in the United States and Europe;\n\u25cf\nour ability to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our eSVS Mesh;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain FDA approval of our eSVS Mesh and other required regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf\nthe market acceptance and level of future sales of our eSVS Mesh;\n\u25cf\nthe rate at which physicians adopt our eSVS Mesh for use in CABG surgery;\n\u25cf\nthe selling price of our eSVS Mesh to distributors and the price that distributors charge hospitals;\n\u25cf\nthe rate of progress in establishing reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors;\n\u25cf\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u25cf\nthe cost and delays in product development that may result from changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our eSVS Mesh;\n\u25cf\nthe costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending patent claims;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of commercial operations, including selling and marketing efforts; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to establish and maintain effective relationships with independent distributors.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of our stockholders could be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect their rights as stockholders. If we issue preferred stock, it could affect the rights of our stockholders or reduce the value of our common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, sinking fund provisions, and restrictions on our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our product development and commercialization goals and harm our business.\nPrior to issuing any capital stock with rights, preferences or limitations equal or superior to our common stock owned by Kips Bay Investments, LLC, one of our principal stockholders, or debt securities convertible into capital stock with rights, preferences or limitations equal or superior to our common stock owned by Kips Bay Investments, LLC, we must obtain the consent of Kips Bay Investments, LLC and no assurance can be provided that Kips Bay Investments, LLC would provide such consent, which could limit our ability to raise additional financing.\nIf adequate funds are not available, we may be required to terminate, significantly modify or delay our clinical programs, reduce our planned commercialization efforts, obtain funds through collaborators that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently or consider other strategic alternatives, including ceasing our operations and liquidating our company.\nWe recently streamlined and scaled back our operations to focus our efforts and resources on regulatory and clinical activities which further the clinical development of the eSVS Mesh and to position us to limit our non-clinical operating expenses . This scale back, including in particular the termination of our sales personnel, may harm our business.\nOn January 5, 2015, we announced that we streamlined and scaled back our operations to focus our efforts and resources on regulatory and clinical activities which further the clinical development of the eSVS Mesh. As part of this reorganization, we reduced our personnel from thirteen to eight employees. These reductions included our two sales directors, two administrative positions and one operations position. In addition, our officers agreed to accept temporary salary reductions. We believe that these actions will reduce our monthly cash operating expenses, excluding costs related to our eMESH I clinical feasibility trial, to approximately $200,000. This scale back, including in particular the termination of our sales personnel, may harm our business, especially if we are unable to ramp up if needed in the future and unable to find a sufficient number of qualified personnel at that time. In addition, this scale back, including the temporary salary reductions, may cause us to lose personnel, which may harm our business.\nIf we are unable to commercialize our eSVS Mesh in the United States or other major markets or experience significant delays in doing so, our ability to generate sales will be significantly delayed and our business will be harmed.\nIf we are unable to demonstrate with human clinical data that our eSVS Mesh is safe and improves the long-term patency of SVGs as compared to traditional CABG surgery, we will be unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our eSVS Mesh. We have no other products ready for clinical testing or commercialization; therefore, our ability to remain in business would be doubtful if our eSVS Mesh is not proven to be safe and effective.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval, our eSVS Mesh may only be approved for very limited purposes with many restrictions on its use. Such restrictions would limit our ability to successfully commercialize our eSVS Mesh and our ability to generate sales would be significantly impaired.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval of our eSVS Mesh, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may only approve our eSVS Mesh for very limited purposes with many restrictions on its use or in limited sizes. Although we have obtained CE Mark approval in Europe, and even if we receive FDA or additional foreign regulatory approval, we may be unable to successfully commercialize our eSVS Mesh in Europe, the United States or other major markets, and our ability to generate sales would be significantly impaired.\nOur success depends on the coronary bypass graft market and the superior outcomes of coronary bypass surgery over competitive treatments or procedures, and such superior outcomes may not continue.\nPhysicians treat coronary artery disease with methods other than CABG surgery, including pharmaceutical therapy, balloon angioplasty, stenting with bare metal or drug-eluting stents, atherectomy catheters and lasers. Several of these alternative treatments are widely accepted in the medical community and have a long history of use. In addition, technological advances may result in improvements in these alternative treatments or new therapies that produce superior treatment outcomes as compared to CABG surgery. The medical device industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and profound technological change. Our success depends, in part, upon physicians continuing to perform a significant number of CABG procedures and our ability to achieve and maintain a competitive position in the development of technologies and products in the coronary artery bypass field. If physicians, patients or hospitals opt to use methods other than CABG procedures or use our competitors\u2019 products, our commercial opportunity will be reduced and our potential sales will suffer.\nThe market acceptance of new medical technologies is uncertain, and we may be unable to obtain market acceptance of our eSVS Mesh.\nEven if our clinical trials demonstrate that the use of our eSVS Mesh provides equivalent or more effective results as compared to coronary bypass operations using only the unsupported saphenous vein grafts and even if all regulatory approvals are obtained, the success of our eSVS Mesh will depend upon the acceptance by cardiovascular and cardiothoracic surgeons of our eSVS Mesh as equivalent or better than the current procedure using unsupported saphenous veins and other available treatments. We believe that physicians\u2019 recommendations will be essential for the development and successful marketing of our eSVS Mesh, and physicians will not begin to use our eSVS Mesh unless they determine that it is a safe and effective alternative to current treatment methods. The degree of physician and market acceptance of our eSVS Mesh will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nthe perceived effectiveness of our eSVS Mesh relative to its cost;\n\u25cf\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u25cf\npotential advantages over alternative treatments;\n\u25cf\npublication in peer-reviewed medical journals of data regarding the successful use and longer term clinical benefits of our eSVS Mesh;\n\u25cf\ndevelopment of new products and technologies by our competitors or new alternative treatments;\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments related to manufacturing, marketing and selling our eSVS Mesh both within and outside the United States;\n\u25cf\nperceived liability risks arising out of the use of new products;\n\u25cf\nthe willingness of physicians to adopt new technologies and the ability of physicians to acquire the skills necessary to use our eSVS Mesh;\n\u25cf\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u25cf\nthe adequacy of third-party coverage or reimbursement.\nIf our eSVS Mesh does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, healthcare payors and patients, we may not generate meaningful sales and we may not become profitable. In addition, we have not yet determined pricing for our eSVS Mesh in the United States and our pricing policies could adversely impact market acceptance of our eSVS Mesh as compared to competing products and treatments. Any of the foregoing factors, or other factors, could limit or detract from market acceptance of our eSVS Mesh. If our eSVS Mesh is not accepted by the market, our business would be harmed.\nWe expect to face intense competition and the risk of obsolescence if our competitors develop products superior to our eSVS Mesh.\nWe face competition from established medical technology, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions in the United States and abroad. Companies that have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than us may be working on products similar to our eSVS Mesh. Our eSVS Mesh may not replace current surgical techniques and other products or techniques may render our eSVS Mesh obsolete. In addition, our distributors face competition from established companies with significantly greater financial and marketing resources. Our competitors may produce more advanced products than ours or demonstrate superior safety of their products. Our ability to effectively compete depends on our ability to innovate successfully. Demand for our eSVS Mesh could be diminished by equivalent or superior products and technologies offered by competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with, or mergers with or acquisitions by, large and established companies or through the development of novel products and technologies.\nWe are aware of three companies that have developed support devices to be used on the outside of SVGs, one of which has begun sales activities and is a direct competitor to our eSVS Mesh. See \u201cBusiness-Competition\u201d for additional information.\nOur competitive position also depends on:\n\u25cf\nobtaining any necessary U.S. or foreign marketing approvals;\n\u25cf\nwidespread awareness, acceptance and adoption by the cardiovascular and cardiothoracic markets of our eSVS Mesh;\n\u25cf\nproduct coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, insurance companies and others;\n\u25cf\npublished studies supporting the effectiveness and safety and long-term clinical benefit of our eSVS Mesh;\n\u25cf\nproperly identifying customer needs and delivering new products or product enhancements to address those needs;\n\u25cf\nlimiting the time required from proof of feasibility to routine production;\n\u25cf\nlimiting the timing and cost of regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf\nour ability to attract and retain qualified personnel;\n\u25cf\nthe extent of our patent protection or our ability to otherwise develop proprietary products and processes;\n\u25cf\nour ability to maintain adequate manufacturing capacity and to source the materials and equipment required to manufacture our eSVS Mesh; and\n\u25cf\nsecuring sufficient capital resources to expand our research and development, sales and marketing efforts, and manufacturing capacity.\nIf our eSVS Mesh is not competitive based on these or other factors, our business would be harmed.\nThe market for our eSVS Mesh is rapidly changing and competitive, and new treatments which may be developed by others could impair our ability to maintain and grow our business and remain competitive.\nThe industry in which we operate has undergone, and is expected to continue to undergo, rapid and significant technological change, and we expect competition to intensify as technical advances are made. Our competitors may develop and commercialize medical devices that are safer or more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than coronary artery bypass surgery. For example, we are aware of companies that are developing various other technologies for treating cardiovascular disease which are less invasive than coronary artery bypass surgery which could render our technology obsolete. We also compete in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials. All of these factors could impair our ability to maintain our technology.\nWe have limited manufacturing resources and experience, and if our manufacturing facilities are unable to provide an adequate supply of our eSVS Mesh, our growth could be limited and our business could be harmed.\nWe have limited experience in manufacturing our eSVS Mesh and rely on outside vendors for several materials and processes. We currently manufacture our eSVS Mesh for our clinical trials, research and development purposes and commercialization at our manufacturing facility in Minnesota. If our existing manufacturing facility experiences a disruption, we would have no other means of manufacturing our eSVS Mesh until we are able to restore the manufacturing capability at our current facility or develop alternative manufacturing facilities.\nIf we are unable to produce sufficient quantities of our eSVS Mesh for use in our current and planned clinical trials or for commercialization, or if our manufacturing process yields a substandard product, our regulatory, development and commercialization efforts would be delayed.\nIn order to produce our eSVS Mesh in the quantities that will be required for commercialization, we will have to increase, or \u201cscale up,\u201d the production process over the current level of production. Manufacturers often encounter difficulties in scaling up production, including problems involving yields, controlling and anticipating costs, quality control and assurance, supply and shortages of qualified personnel. If the scaled-up production process is not efficient or produces a product that does not meet quality and other standards, we may be unable to meet market demand and our sales, business and financial prospects would be adversely affected. The contract vendors with which we are and will be developing relationships may not have the ability to produce the quantities of the materials needed for human clinical trials or commercial sales or may not do so at prices that allow our eSVS Mesh to compete successfully in the market. Additionally, any damage to or destruction of our facilities or our equipment, prolonged power outage or contamination at our facilities would significantly impair our ability to produce our eSVS Mesh.\nWe depend upon third-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers to provide us certain components of our eSVS Mesh. We depend on these suppliers to provide us with materials in a timely manner that meet our quality, quantity and cost requirements. These suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including unanticipated demand from larger customers, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, failure to comply with applicable regulations, equipment malfunction, quality or yield problems, and environmental factors, any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand. Our reliance on these outside suppliers also subjects us to other risks that could harm our business, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\ninterruption of supply resulting from modifications to, or discontinuation of, a supplier\u2019s operations;\n\u25cf\ndelays in product shipments resulting from defects, reliability issues or changes in components from suppliers;\n\u25cf\nprice fluctuations due to a lack of long-term supply arrangements for key components with our suppliers;\n\u25cf\nerrors in manufacturing components, which could negatively impact the effectiveness or safety of our eSVS Mesh or cause delays in shipment of our eSVS Mesh;\n\u25cf\ndiscontinued production of components, which could significantly delay our production and sales and impair operating margins;\n\u25cf\nan inability to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner or on commercially acceptable terms;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty locating and qualifying alternative suppliers for our sole-source supplies;\n\u25cf\ndelays in production and sales caused by switching components, which may require product redesign and new regulatory submissions;\n\u25cf\ndelays due to evaluation and testing of products from alternative suppliers and corresponding regulatory qualifications;\n\u25cf\nnon-timely delivery of components due to our suppliers manufacturing products for a range of customers; and\n\u25cf\nan inability of suppliers to fulfill orders and meet requirements because of supplier financial hardships.\nOther than existing, unfulfilled purchase orders, our suppliers have no contractual obligations to supply us with, and we are not contractually obligated to purchase from them, any of our supplies. Any supply interruption from our suppliers or failure to obtain additional suppliers for any of the components used in our eSVS Mesh would limit our ability to manufacture our eSVS Mesh and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we lost one of our suppliers and were unable to obtain an alternate source in a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, our production schedules could be delayed, our margins could be negatively impacted, and we could fail to meet our customers\u2019 demand. Our customers will rely upon our ability to meet committed delivery dates and any disruption in the supply of key components would adversely affect our ability to meet these dates and could result in legal action by our customers, cause us to lose customers or harm our ability to attract new customers, any of which could decrease our sales and negatively impact our growth. In addition, to the extent that our suppliers use technology or manufacturing processes that are proprietary, we may be unable to obtain comparable materials or components from alternative sources. Manufacturing operations are often faced with a supplier\u2019s decision to discontinue manufacturing a component, which may force us to make last time purchases, qualify a substitute part, or make a design change which may divert engineering time away from the development of new products.\nWe may experience future manufacturing difficulties, and our clinical trials and our commercialization could be delayed by quality control issues in our supply and manufacturing processes.\nAny difficulties in locating and hiring material manufacturers or in the ability of manufacturers to supply materials at the times and in the quantities we need, and at prices that allow us to compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Therefore, even if we are able to contract with manufacturers for key materials or supplies, we may experience future manufacturing difficulties.\nThe production of our eSVS Mesh must occur in a highly controlled, clean environment to minimize particles and other yield- and quality-limiting contaminants. In spite of stringent quality controls, weaknesses in process control or minute impurities in materials may cause a substantial percentage of defective products in a lot. In addition, we must meet certain lot release specifications before our eSVS Mesh can be shipped to our clinical trial sites or to commercial markets. If a particular lot fails to meet lot release specifications, we will not be able to ship that lot to our clinical trial sites or to commercial markets. If we are not able to maintain stringent quality controls, if contamination problems arise or if we are not able to meet our lot release specifications, our clinical trials or sales efforts could be delayed, which would harm our business and our results of operations.\nWe operate in foreign jurisdictions which exposes us to international business risks.\nAs part of our product development, regulatory and commercial strategy, we intend to continue to conduct clinical trials and market our eSVS Mesh internationally. There are a number of risks associated with conducting business internationally, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\npotential differences in treatment protocols and methods across the markets in which we expect to test or promote our eSVS Mesh;\n\u25cf\npotential differences in reimbursement levels and the requirements necessary to obtain such reimbursement;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and political conditions in the markets in which we operate;\n\u25cf\npotential international conflicts, including terrorist acts;\n\u25cf\npotential increased costs associated with overlapping tax structures;\n\u25cf\npotential trade restrictions, exchange controls and legal restrictions on the repatriation of funds into the United States;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations, including risks of violations of local laws or the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by employees overseas or the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions;\n\u25cf\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\nthe difficulties of compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations;\n\u25cf\nunfavorable regulations in foreign jurisdictions regarding distributors;\n\u25cf\nlonger accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries; and\n\u25cf\nimport and export licensing requirements.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our international operations or financial results, which would harm our business.\nWe could become subject to product liability claims, product recalls, other field actions and warranty claims that could be expensive, divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business.\nWe face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our eSVS Mesh results or is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects to a patient. In many jurisdictions, producers of medical products are strictly liable for personal injuries caused by medical devices. We may be held liable if our eSVS Mesh causes injury or death or is found otherwise unsuitable during usage. Because our eSVS Mesh is designed to be used in complex surgical procedures, defects could result in a number of complications, including serious injury or death. It is also possible that defects in the design, manufacture or labeling of our eSVS Mesh might necessitate a product recall or other field corrective action, which may result in warranty claims beyond our expectations and may harm our reputation. We believe potential disadvantages associated with our eSVS Mesh include the possibility of allergic reaction to the implant materials and the possibility of damage to the saphenous vein during placement of our eSVS Mesh. A product liability claim, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, and even if we are ultimately successful in defending it, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and reputation. For example, it could result in significant legal defense costs. The coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate to cover future claims. We may be unable to maintain product liability insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or with adequate amounts. A product liability claim, any product recalls or other field actions or excessive warranty claims, whether arising from defects in design or manufacture or otherwise, could divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and result in sizable damage awards against us, any of which could harm our reputation and business.\nIf third-party payors do not provide sufficient coverage or reimbursement to healthcare providers for the use of our eSVS Mesh, our acceptance in the marketplace would be harmed.\nThe availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement for newly approved medical devices and procedures is uncertain. Our success depends upon the use of our eSVS Mesh and whether third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement for the use of this product is available.\nOur success in international markets depends upon the eligibility of reimbursement for our eSVS Mesh through government-sponsored healthcare payment systems and third-party payors or the willingness of hospitals to allocate budgets to cover the cost of our eSVS Mesh. Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country and, within some countries, by region. In many international markets, payment systems may control reimbursement for procedures performed using new products as well as procurement of these products. As an example, we were denied government-sponsored supplemental reimbursement in Germany for our eSVS Mesh for 2014. In addition, as economies of emerging markets develop, these countries may implement changes in their healthcare delivery and payment or budget systems. Furthermore, healthcare cost containment efforts similar to those underway in the United States are prevalent in many of the countries in which we sell and intend to sell our eSVS Mesh and these efforts are expected to continue. Market acceptance of our eSVS Mesh in a particular country may depend on the availability and level of reimbursement or available budget in that country. In the event that our customers are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement for our eSVS Mesh in international markets in which we are seeking to sell our eSVS Mesh, market acceptance of our eSVS Mesh would be adversely affected.\nIn the United States, our eSVS Mesh would be purchased primarily by medical institutions, which would then bill various third-party payors, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, which administers the Medicare program, and other government programs and private insurance plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The process involved in applying for coverage and incremental reimbursement from CMS is lengthy and expensive. Even if our eSVS Mesh receives FDA and other regulatory approval, it may not be granted coverage and reimbursement in the foreseeable future, if at all. Moreover, many private payors look to CMS in setting their reimbursement policies and amounts. If CMS or other agencies limit coverage or decrease or limit reimbursement payments for doctors and hospitals, this may affect coverage and reimbursement determinations by many private payors.\nCMS may not provide coverage and reimbursement for our eSVS Mesh. If a medical device does not receive incremental reimbursement from CMS, then a medical institution would have to absorb the cost of our eSVS Mesh as part of the cost of the procedure in which the products are used. Acute care hospitals are now generally reimbursed by CMS for inpatient operating costs under a Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment system. Under the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment system, acute care hospitals receive a fixed payment amount for each covered hospitalized patient based upon the Diagnosis-Related Group, or DRG, to which the inpatient stay is assigned, regardless of the actual cost of the services provided. At this time, we do not know the extent to which medical institutions would consider insurers\u2019 payment levels adequate to cover the cost of our eSVS Mesh. Failure by hospitals and physicians to receive an amount that they consider to be adequate reimbursement for procedures in which our eSVS Mesh is used could deter them from purchasing our eSVS Mesh and limit our sales growth. In addition, pre-determined DRG payments may decline over time, which could deter medical institutions from purchasing our eSVS Mesh. If medical institutions are unable to justify the costs of our eSVS Mesh, they may refuse to purchase it, which would significantly harm our business.\nWe are dependent upon our founder and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the loss of his services or our inability to attract and retain required management, financial, technical, regulatory and sales personnel may divert management\u2019s attention and negatively impact our operations.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management, including in particular Manny Villafa\u00f1a, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. If the initial results from our current eMESH I clinical feasibility trial are positive, we anticipate that we would hire a new Chief Executive Officer and that Mr. Villafa\u00f1a would transition to the role of Executive Chairman. In the event Mr. Villafa\u00f1a does not agree to serve as Executive Chairman, the loss of his services could impair our ability to obtain required regulatory approvals of and commercialize our eSVS Mesh and develop new products and could harm our business. Our future success may depend on our ability to retain Mr. Villafa\u00f1a, hire a new Chief Executive Officer and retain our Chief Financial Officer and other senior management and attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Competition for senior management personnel, as well as clinical and regulatory specialists, engineers and sales personnel is intense and we may not be able to retain our personnel. The loss of a member of our senior management or our professional staff would require the remaining senior executive officers to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement. Each of our senior officers may terminate his employment at any time without notice and without cause or good reason. Because of our current regulatory position and financial position, including in particular the recent temporary decreases in base salaries to which our executive officers agreed, it is possible that one or more of our executive officers may choose to terminate their employment with us and secure alternative employment that may be more stable. We do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees. If we lose the services of any key personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions or to the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our markets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nBecause healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, numerous initiatives and reforms initiated by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to create new companies with greater market power, including hospitals. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services to industry participants has become and will continue to become more intense. This in turn has resulted and likely will continue to result in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions for some of our customers. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers, which may reduce competition, exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and may adversely impact our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization and we may experience difficulties managing growth. If we are unable to manage the anticipated growth of our business, our future sales and operating results may be adversely affected.\nIf our clinical trials our successful and we are successful in obtaining additional regulatory approvals for our eSVS Mesh and selling our eSVS Mesh, we would need to expand our sales support and marketing staff, and administrative and financial resources to meet anticipated growth in demand for our eSVS Mesh. We may face difficulties in recruiting, training, managing and retaining an adequate number of qualified personnel to support this growth. Expansion in personnel may mean that less experienced people could be providing clinical and sales and marketing support for our eSVS Mesh, and managing our administrative and financial functions, which could result in unanticipated costs and disruptions to our operations. If we cannot scale and manage our business appropriately, our anticipated growth may be impaired and our operating results will suffer.\nOur status as a public company causes us to incur significant costs, places demands on our management and diverts management\u2019s attention from our core business.\nThe obligations of being a U.S. public reporting company, including substantial public reporting, auditing and corporate governance obligations, require significant expenditures, place demands on our management and divert management\u2019s time and attention away from our core business. These obligations may require us to hire additional personnel in order to ensure compliance with the regulatory requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We are required to report on our internal controls, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our management may not be able to effectively and timely implement controls and procedures that adequately respond to the increased regulatory compliance and reporting requirements that are applicable to us as a public company. If we fail to staff our accounting and finance function adequately or maintain internal controls adequate to meet the demands that are placed upon us as a public company, we may be unable to report our financial results accurately or in a timely manner and our business and stock price may suffer. The costs of being a public company, as well as diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur competitive position is contingent upon the protection of our intellectual property.\nAs of January 1, 2015, we had 14 issued patents covering the eSVS Mesh, including seven issued in the United States, two each issued in Canada, Japan and South Africa, and one issued European patent. The European patent has been validated and is enforceable in eight European countries. In addition, we have two patent applications pending in the United States and five patent applications pending in countries outside the United States covering various aspects of our eSVS Mesh.\nAny patents we have or obtain in the future might be invalidated or circumvented by third parties. If any challenges are successful, competitors might be able to market products and use manufacturing processes that are substantially similar to ours. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by consultants, vendors or former or current employees, despite the existence generally of confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions. Monitoring unauthorized use and disclosure of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate. In addition, the laws of many foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If our intellectual property is not adequately protected against competitors\u2019 products and methods, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business.\nOur commercial success, if any, will be significantly harmed if we infringe the patent rights of third parties or if we breach any agreements that we have entered into with regard to our technology or business. The medical device industry is characterized by frequent and extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Many medical device companies with substantially greater resources than us have employed intellectual property litigation as a way to gain a competitive advantage. We may become involved in litigation, interference proceedings, oppositions, reexamination, protest or other potentially adverse intellectual property proceedings as a result of alleged infringement by us of the rights of others or as a result of priority of invention disputes with third parties. Third parties may also challenge the validity of any of our issued patents. Similarly, we may initiate proceedings to enforce our patent rights and prevent others from infringing our intellectual property rights. In any of these circumstances, we might have to spend significant amounts of money, time and effort defending our position and we may not be successful. In addition, any claims relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights or proprietary determinations, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, lengthy governmental proceedings, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements that are not advantageous to us. We may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against a challenge.\nBecause we operate in the highly technical field of medical technology development, we rely in part on trade secret protection in order to protect our proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect, and we cannot be certain that others will not develop the same or similar technologies on their own. We have taken steps, including entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties any confidential information developed by the party or made known to the party by us during the course of the party\u2019s relationship with us. We also typically obtain agreements from these parties which provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However, these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets or know-how is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets or know-how. The failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nClaims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others could prohibit us from protecting our rights to, or use and commercialization of, our eSVS Mesh, which could harm our business.\nThe medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and companies in the industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. We may become a party to patent infringement claims and litigation or interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine the priority of inventions. The defense and prosecution of these matters are both costly and time consuming.\nAdditionally, we may need to commence proceedings against others to enforce our patents, to protect our trade secrets or know-how or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. These proceedings would result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel.\nWe are aware of patents issued to third parties that contain subject matter related to our technology. These or other third parties may assert that our eSVS Mesh infringes the claims in their patents or seek to expand their patent claims to cover aspects of our eSVS Mesh. An adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to seek licenses. In addition, if we are found to willfully infringe third-party patents, we could be required to pay treble damages in addition to other penalties. Although patent and intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. We may be unable to obtain necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we do not obtain necessary licenses, we may be required to redesign our eSVS Mesh to avoid infringement, and it may not be possible to do so effectively. Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could cause us to incur significant costs, place significant strain on our resources, divert management\u2019s attention from our business and harm our reputation and prevent us from commercializing our eSVS Mesh or any other product we may develop, which would have a significant adverse impact on our business. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends upon compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nIf the core intellectual property relating to our eSVS Mesh reverts to Medtronic, our business will be adversely affected.\nThe core intellectual property relating to our eSVS Mesh, which constitutes most of our issued patents and our pending patent applications, was sold to us by Medtronic pursuant to an Assignment and License Agreement dated October 9, 2007. If we become insolvent, make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, go into liquidation or receivership or otherwise lose legal control of our business, all technology sold to us pursuant to our agreement with Medtronic, including the core intellectual property and patent rights related to our eSVS Mesh, may revert to Medtronic, upon notice by Medtronic. In addition, if we determine to cease commercializing our eSVS Mesh, Medtronic may cause the core intellectual property and patent rights related to our eSVS Mesh to revert to Medtronic.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval and Other Governmental Regulations\nThe sale of our eSVS Mesh is subject to regulatory approvals and our business is subject to extensive regulatory requirements. If we fail to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals, or are unable to obtain, or experience significant delays in obtaining, FDA and other regulatory approvals for our eSVS Mesh and any other future products or product enhancements, our ability to commercially distribute and market these products could suffer.\nOur eSVS Mesh and operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and various other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Government regulation of medical devices is meant to assure their safety and effectiveness, and includes regulation of, among other things:\n\u25cf\ndesign, development and manufacturing;\n\u25cf\ntesting, labeling, packaging, content and language of instructions for use, and storage;\n\u25cf\nclinical trials;\n\u25cf\nproduct safety;\n\u25cf\npremarket clearance and approval;\n\u25cf\nmarketing, sales and distribution (including making product claims);\n\u25cf\nadvertising and promotion;\n\u25cf\nproduct modifications;\n\u25cf\nrecordkeeping procedures;\n\u25cf\nreports of corrections, removals, enhancements, recalls and field corrective actions;\n\u25cf\npost-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;\n\u25cf\ncomplying with the new federal law and regulations requiring Unique Device Identifiers (UDI) on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA\u2019s Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID); and\n\u25cf\nproduct import and export.\nBefore a new medical device, or a new use of, or claim for, an existing product can be marketed in the United States, it must first receive either premarket clearance under Section 510(k) of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, a de novo approval or a pre-market approval, or PMA, from the FDA, unless an exemption applies. Our coronary eSVS Mesh has been designated a Class III product by the FDA and will be required to go through the PMA process. Other indications of our eSVS Mesh, including peripheral and arteriovenous fistula applications, have not been classified at this time.\nThe PMA pathway requires an applicant to demonstrate reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data including, but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. Products that are approved through a PMA application generally need FDA approval before they can be modified. The PMA pathway is much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and it generally takes from one to five years, or even longer, from the time the application is filed with the FDA until an approval is obtained. The process of obtaining a PMA and other regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and we may not be able to obtain approvals on a timely basis, if at all.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a device for many reasons, including:\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that our products are safe and effective for their intended uses;\n\u25cf\nthe data from our pre-clinical studies (bench and/or animal) and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval;\n\u25cf\nthe manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in FDA clearance or approval policies or the adoption of new regulations may require additional data.\nAny delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, approvals for our eSVS Mesh or other products could prevent us from generating sales in the United States.\nThe FDA may not approve future investigational device exemption applications for our eSVS Mesh, which would prevent us from conducting our clinical trials in the United States, and even if the FDA does grant such approval, our clinical trials may be more costly and burdensome than we currently anticipate, which would limit or delay our ability to complete clinical trials and ultimately market our eSVS Mesh in the United States.\nAssuming the results from our current feasibility trial are successful, we intend to submit an IDE application to conduct a larger pivotal trial. If the FDA approves an IDE application to conduct a pivotal trial, the clinical study we conduct may have unanticipated complications and delays and may be more costly than we currently anticipate. The FDA may approve our IDE application with conditions relating to the scope or design of our clinical trials for which we have not planned. These conditions may require us to collect additional data, enroll more patients, spend more time and expend more resources than we currently anticipate, and these conditions may make a clinical trial in the United States more costly and time consuming than we currently plan. Any unanticipated costs and length of U.S. clinical trials would delay our ability to market our eSVS Mesh in the United States, which would harm our business.\nIf the FDA does not approve our IDE application, we would be unable to conduct a pivotal trial of our eSVS Mesh in the United States. If we are unable to conduct a pivotal trial in the United States, we would not be able to submit a PMA application and we would be unable to market our eSVS Mesh in the United States, which would have an adverse effect on our business. We have no other products ready for clinical testing or commercialization; therefore, our ability to remain in business would be doubtful if our eSVS Mesh is not proven to be safe and effective and we are unable to obtain regulatory approval and market it in the United States. If our current feasibility trial or our anticipated larger pivotal trial is not successful, we may need to consider other strategic alternatives, including ceasing our operations and liquidating our company. If a decision is made to cease operations and liquidate our company, our stockholders likely will lose their entire investment.\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals from countries other than the United States, our ability to sell our products and generate sales will be materially harmed.\nWe currently market, and intend to continue to market, our eSVS Mesh outside the United States. To market and sell our eSVS Mesh in countries outside the United States, we must seek and obtain regulatory approvals, certifications or registrations and comply with the laws and regulations of those countries. These laws and regulations, including the requirements for approvals, certifications or registrations and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals, certifications or registrations are expensive, and we cannot be certain that we will receive regulatory approvals, certifications or registrations in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products. The regulatory approval process outside the United States may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval in addition to other risks.\nIn order to market our products in the Member States of the European Economic Area, or EEA, our devices are required to comply with the essential requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directives (Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices, as amended. Compliance with these requirements entitles us to affix the CE conformity mark to our medical devices, without which they cannot be commercialized in the EEA. In order to demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements and obtain the right to affix the CE conformity mark we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the Medical Devices Directives, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body, which is an organization accredited by a Member State of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments. The Notified Body would typically audit and examine the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices before issuing a certification demonstrating compliance with the essential requirements. Based on this certification we can draw up an EC Declaration of Conformity, which allows us to affix the CE mark to our products. We received authorization to apply the CE Mark to our eSVS Mesh in May 2010 and in November 2013, we received an updated CE Mark expanding our ability to promote the eSVS Mesh for use with sequential grafts. We received an updated CE Mark approval in August 2014 for the new implant technique approved by the FDA in March 2014.\nWe may not obtain other regulatory approvals or certifications outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval or certification by regulatory authorities or Notified Bodies in other countries, and approval or certification by one foreign regulatory authority or Notified Body does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or by the FDA. We may be required to perform additional pre-clinical or clinical studies even if FDA approval, or the right to bear the CE Mark, has been obtained. If we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals, certifications or registrations in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nEven if our eSVS Mesh is approved by regulatory authorities, if we fail to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our eSVS Mesh, it could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market and governmental authorities could take certain adverse actions against us.\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. Even if regulatory approval of our eSVS Mesh is granted in the United States, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or effectiveness of the product. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our eSVS Mesh, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturer or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recall, fines, suspension of regulatory approvals, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nOur sales will initially be dependent upon sales of our eSVS Mesh outside the United States. Foreign regulatory bodies have established varying regulations governing product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. We rely heavily upon independent foreign distributors to comply with such foreign regulatory requirements. Our inability or failure, or the inability or failure of such foreign distributors, to comply with varying foreign regulation or the imposition of new regulations could restrict the sale of our eSVS Mesh internationally and thereby harm our business.\nIn addition, although we do not provide healthcare services, submit claims for third-party reimbursement, or receive payments directly from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors for our eSVS Mesh, healthcare regulation by federal, state and foreign governments could significantly impact our business. Healthcare fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws potentially applicable to our operations include, among others:\n\u25cf\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Law, which constrains our marketing practices and those of our independent distributors, educational programs, pricing, bundling and rebate policies, grants for physician-initiated trials and CME, and other remunerative relationships with healthcare providers, by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, intended to induce the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs;\n\u25cf\nfederal false claims laws (such as the federal False Claims Act) which prohibit, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, this impacts and regulates the reimbursement advice we give to our customers as it cannot be inaccurate and must relate to on-label uses of our products;\n\u25cf\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and its implementing regulations, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u25cf\nstate laws analogous to each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of certain health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts; and\n\u25cf\nfederal, state and international laws that impose reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to prescribers and other healthcare providers.\nIf our past or present operations, or those of our distributors or agents, are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Similarly, if the healthcare providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could also have a negative impact on us. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our company being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Further, the 2010 U.S. healthcare law, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the 2010 U.S. healthcare law provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are required to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other benefits. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of \u201coff books\u201d slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. We also are subject to similar anticorruption legislation implemented in Europe under the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. We either operate or plan to operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential violations of the FCPA and other anticorruption laws, and we utilize a number of distributors for whose actions we could be held liable under the FCPA. We inform our personnel, distributors and agents of the requirements of the FCPA and other anticorruption laws, including, but not limited to their reporting requirements. We also have developed and will continue to develop and implement systems for formalizing contracting processes, performing due diligence on personnel, distributors and agents and improving our recordkeeping and auditing practices regarding these regulations. However, there is no guarantee that our personnel, distributors or agents have not or will not engage in conduct undetected by our processes and for which we might be held responsible under the FCPA or other anticorruption laws.\nIf our personnel, distributors or agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other remedial measures, including further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, as well as potential personnel changes and disciplinary actions. During the past few years, the SEC has increased its enforcement of violations of the FCPA against companies, including several medical device companies. Although we do not believe we are currently a target, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anticorruption laws by U.S. or foreign authorities also could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nCertain foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to prohibitions as strict as those under the FCPA or, even if subjected to strict prohibitions, such prohibitions may be laxly enforced in practice. If our competitors engage in corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft or other fraudulent practices, they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of some companies, giving our competitors an advantage in securing business, or from government officials, who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses, which would put us at a disadvantage.\nThe use, misuse or off-label use of our products may harm our image in the marketplace or result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business or result in sanctions if we are deemed to have engaged in improper promotion of our products.\nOur promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition on the promotion of a medical device for a use that has not been cleared or approved by the FDA. Use of a device outside of its cleared or approved indication is known as \u201coff-label\u201d use. We cannot prevent a surgeon from using our products or procedure for off-label use, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. However, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials, reimbursement advice or training of sales representatives or physicians constitute promotion of an off-label use, the FDA could request that we modify our training or promotional or reimbursement materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, disgorgement of profits, a civil fine and criminal penalties. Other federal, state or foreign governmental authorities also might take action if they consider our promotion or training materials to constitute promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products would be impaired.\nFurther, the advertising and promotion of our products is subject to EEA Member States laws implementing Directive 93/42/EEC concerning Medical Devices, or the EU Medical Devices Directive, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals. Our failure to comply with all these laws and requirements may harm our business and operating results.\nIf our eSVS Mesh is defective or otherwise poses safety risks, governmental authorities could require a recall, or we may initiate a recall of our products voluntarily.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities may require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture or in the event that a product poses an unacceptable risk to health. Manufacturers, on their own initiative, may recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of our eSVS Mesh or any future product of ours would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Any recall could impair our ability to produce our eSVS Mesh in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. We also may be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits.\nUnder the FDA medical device reporting regulations, or MDR, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our product has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. If we fail to report these events to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, the FDA could take enforcement action against us. Any adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection, mandatory recall or other enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nIn the EEA we must comply with the EU Medical Device Vigilance System, the purpose of which is to improve the protection of health and safety of patients, users and others by reducing the likelihood of reoccurrence of incidents related to the use of a medical device. Under this system, incidents must be reported to the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA. An incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectly, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient or user or of other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health. Incidents are evaluated by the EEA competent authorities to whom they have been reported, and where appropriate, information is disseminated between them in the form of National Competent Authority Reports, or NCARs. The Medical Device Vigilance System is further intended to facilitate a direct, early and harmonized implementation of Field Safety Corrective Actions, or FSCAs across the Member States of the EEA where the device is in use. An FSCA is an action taken by a manufacturer to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices.\nWe may initiate voluntary recalls involving our eSVS Mesh or any future product of ours in the future that we determine do not require notification to the FDA or other regulatory authorities. If the FDA or other regulatory authorities disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA or other regulatory authorities could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.\nOur manufacturing operations require us to comply with the FDA\u2019s and other governmental authorities\u2019 laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and production of medical devices, which is costly and could subject us to enforcement action.\nWe and certain of our third-party manufacturers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Program (cGMP) and Quality System Regulations, or QSR, which cover the methods of documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our products. We and certain of our suppliers also are subject to the regulations of foreign jurisdictions regarding the manufacturing process for our products marketed outside of the United States. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities The failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, could result in, among other things, any of the following enforcement actions:\n\u25cf\nuntitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, disgorgement of profits, criminal and civil penalties;\n\u25cf\ncustomer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u25cf\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u25cf\nrefusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products or modified products;\n\u25cf\nwithdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMAs that have already been granted;\n\u25cf\nrefusal to grant export approval for our products; or\n\u25cf\ncriminal prosecution.\nAny of these actions could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. We also may be required to bear other costs or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future revenue and our ability to generate profits. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could result in our failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nThe results of our clinical trials may not support our product claims or may result in the discovery of adverse side effects.\nOur ongoing research and development and clinical trial activities are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the United States and abroad. We are currently conducting clinical studies, including our feasibility trial in Europe and the United States, of our eSVS Mesh to gather additional information about our product\u2019s safety, efficacy or optimal use. In the future we may conduct additional clinical trials to support approval of new products. Clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations or the FDA may take enforcement action. The data collected from these clinical trials may ultimately be used to support market approval for these products. Even if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our product claims or that the FDA or foreign authorities will agree with our conclusions regarding them. Success in pre-clinical testing and early clinical trials does not always ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the later trials will replicate the results of prior trials and studies. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our products are safe and effective for the proposed indicated uses, which could cause us to abandon a product and may delay development of others. Any delay or termination of our clinical trials will delay the filing of our product submissions and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our products and generate sales. It is also possible that patients enrolled in clinical trials will experience adverse side effects that are not currently part of the product\u2019s profile.\nWe are and will continue to be highly dependent on third-party institutions to conduct our clinical testing, and the results of such testing may delay or prevent regulatory approval of our eSVS Mesh.\nWe rely on clinical investigators and clinical trial sites to enroll patients in our clinical trials and other third parties to manage our trials and to perform related data collection and analysis. However, we are not able to control the amount and timing of resources that clinical trial sites devote to our clinical trials. If these clinical investigators and clinical trial sites fail to enroll a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials or fail to ensure compliance by patients with clinical protocols, we will be unable to complete our planned trials, which could prevent us from obtaining regulatory approvals for our eSVS Mesh. Enrollment in our current eMESH I clinical feasibility trial has been slow and disappointing. Our agreements with clinical investigators and clinical trial sites for clinical testing place substantial responsibilities on these parties and, if these parties fail to perform as expected, our planned trials could be delayed or terminated. If these clinical investigators, clinical trial sites, or other third parties do not carry out their contractual duties or obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, the FDA\u2019s good clinical practice regulations or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, our eSVS Mesh. In addition, the data obtained from human clinical testing is subject to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval, and delays or rejection may be encountered based upon changes in FDA policy for device approval during the period of development.\nFuture regulatory actions may adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacture and marketing of a medical device. In addition, FDA and other regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted or regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.\nWe may never obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our eSVS Mesh, which would adversely affect our sales and harm our business.\nEven if third-party payors provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our eSVS Mesh, adverse changes in third-party payors\u2019 general policies toward reimbursement could preclude market acceptance for our eSVS Mesh and harm our potential sales and sales growth, which in turn would harm our business. Recently, healthcare reform legislation was signed into law in the United States and we expect that there will continue to be legislative proposals for governmental controls over healthcare in the United States and other countries. Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage or companies to demonstrate the superiority of their product before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such devices or procedures.\nThe trend toward managed healthcare in the United States and other countries and legislation intended to reduce the cost of government insurance programs will significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products, and could result in lower or no reimbursement for our eSVS Mesh. It is uncertain whether our eSVS Mesh will be viewed as sufficiently cost-effective to warrant adequate coverage and reimbursement levels.\nOur operations involve hazardous materials, and we must comply with environmental laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to a variety of state and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage, disposal and human exposure to hazardous and toxic materials. We currently generate small quantities of waste alcohol and acids, classifying us as a Very Small Quantity Generator with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, which requires us to comply with county and state registration requirements. We expect that compliance costs will be less than $5,000 for 2015. However, environmental laws could become more stringent over time, and we may increase the use of hazardous materials in our operations in the future, which could impose greater compliance costs on us and increase the risks and penalties associated with violations, any of which could harm our business. Compliance with future environmental and safety laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities, impair our research, development or production efforts, or require us to incur other significant expenses. We could incur costs, fines and civil and criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or could be required to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws. There can be no assurance that violations of environmental laws or regulations will not occur in the future as a result of the inability to obtain permits, human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes.\nU.S. healthcare reform legislation includes provisions that may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs the 2010 U.S. healthcare law continues to be phased in, we believe the law may have an impact on various aspects of our business operations. The law\u2019s Medicare payment reforms, such as accountable care organizations and bundled payments, may provide incentives for healthcare providers to reduce spending on our eSVS Mesh and reduce utilization of hospital procedures that use our eSVS Mesh if and when our eSVS Mesh receives FDA approval. Accordingly, while it is still too early to fully understand and predict the ultimate impact of the law on our business, ongoing implementation of this legislation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Associated With Our Common Stock\nOur common stock was delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market, now trades on the OTCQB and is considered a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which may result in difficulty for our stockholders to buy or sell shares of our common stock.\nAs a result of the delisting of our common stock from The NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock is subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules adopted under Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules generally apply to companies whose common stock is not listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market or other national securities exchange and trades at less than $5.00 per share, other than companies that have had average revenue of at least $6,000,000 for the last three years or that have tangible net worth of at least $5,000,000 ($2,000,000 if the company has been operating for three or more years). The penny stock rules require, among other things, that brokers who trade penny stock to persons other than \u201cestablished customers\u201d complete certain documentation, make suitability inquiries of investors and provide investors with certain information concerning trading in the security, including a risk disclosure document and quote information under certain circumstances. Many brokers have decided not to trade penny stocks because of the requirements of the penny stock rules and, as a result, the number of broker-dealers willing to act as market makers in such securities is limited. If we remain subject to the penny stock rules for any significant period, it could have an adverse effect on the market, if any, for our securities. If our securities are subject to the penny stock rules, our stockholders and investors will find it more difficult to buy or sell our securities.\nWe may experience volatility in our stock price, which may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock ranged from a low of $0.12 to a high of $0.99 per share during 2014, and it may continue to experience significant volatility from time to time. In addition to the risk factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following factors, many of which are outside of our control, could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly in the future:\n\u25cf\ninconclusive or failed clinical trial outcomes of our eSVS Mesh;\n\u25cf\na decision to cease operations and liquidate our company;\n\u25cf\nfailure to achieve required governmental approvals to market and sell our eSVS Mesh;\n\u25cf\nfailure to achieve market acceptance for and significant sales of our eSVS Mesh;\n\u25cf\ninability to manufacture our eSVS Mesh in adequate quantities or to commercial standards;\n\u25cf\nloss or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf\ninability to hire, train and retain necessary and qualified personnel;\n\u25cf\nvariations in our quarterly operating results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by our competitors of significant technological developments;\n\u25cf\nchanges in governmental regulations and standards;\n\u25cf\nlitigation related to patent infringement and product liability claims;\n\u25cf\nchanges to financial estimates by equity research analysts;\n\u25cf\nsales of common stock or other securities by us in the future;\n\u25cf\ndecreases in market valuations of similar companies; and\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in stock market prices and volumes.\nEach of these factors, among others, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly in the future.\nIn addition, the stock markets have been extremely volatile. Securities class action litigation is often initiated against a company following a period of volatility in the market price of the company\u2019s securities. If class action litigation is initiated against us, we would incur substantial costs and our management\u2019s attention would be diverted from our operations.\nOur outstanding options and warrants and the availability for resale of the underlying shares may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nAs of March 5, 2015, we had outstanding stock options to purchase 2,237,501 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $1.83 per share and outstanding warrants to purchase 940,625 shares of common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $1.85 per share. Our outstanding options and warrants could adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing or engage in certain mergers or other transactions, since the holders of these options and warrants can be expected to exercise them at a time when we may be able to obtain additional capital through an offering of securities on terms more favorable to us than the terms of outstanding options and warrants. For the life of the options and warrants, the holders have the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock without assuming the risk of ownership. The issuance of shares upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants will also dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.\nFuture sales of our common stock by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline and cause you to lose part or all of your investment.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly. The perception in the public market that our stockholders might sell shares of our common stock could also depress the market price of our common stock. We may file registration statements with the SEC covering shares available for future issuance under Kips Bay Medical, Inc. 2013 Equity Incentive Plan or other shares to be sold by us or our stockholders.\nOur directors, executive officers and significant stockholders have substantial control over us and could limit stockholders\u2019 ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including changes of control.\nAs of March 5, 2015, our directors and executive officers and their affiliated entities beneficially own 17.9% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, Kips Bay Investments, LLC beneficially owns 20.6% of our outstanding common stock. Manny Villafa\u00f1a, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns 15.9% of our outstanding common stock. Our directors, executive officers, significant stockholders and affiliated entities, if acting together, will able to control all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other significant corporate transactions. These stockholders may have interests that differ from other stockholders, and they may vote in a way with which other stockholders disagree and that may be adverse to the interests of other stockholders. The concentration of ownership of our common stock may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company, and may affect the market price of our common stock. This concentration of ownership of our common stock may also have the effect of influencing the completion of a change in control that may not necessarily be in the best interests of all of our stockholders.\nA large percentage of our outstanding common stock is held by insiders, and, as a result, the trading market for our common stock is not as liquid as the stock of other public companies.\nAs of March 5, 2015, 38.5% of our outstanding common stock was beneficially owned by directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and their respective affiliates. The stock of companies with a substantial amount of stock held by insiders is usually not as liquid as the stock of other public companies where insider ownership is not as concentrated. Thus, the trading market for shares of our common stock may not be as liquid as the stock of other public companies.\nOne of our principal stockholders has a right of first offer if we receive an acquisition proposal, which could have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company.\nUnder the terms of our investment agreement with Kips Bay Investments, LLC, we are obligated to give Kips Bay Investments notice within ten days after we receive any acquisition proposal that we intend to pursue, and to negotiate exclusively with Kips Bay Investments for terms under which it might acquire us for a period of twenty days after we provide notice. If we do not reach agreement with Kips Bay Investments, we have a period of 180 days to reach agreement with a third party on terms that are more favorable to us than were proposed by Kips Bay Investments. This right of first offer terminates if we complete an underwritten public offering that generates net proceeds to us of at least $20 million, if we are acquired, or if Kips Bay Investments, LLC no longer holds at least 10% of our voting stock. This right of first offer held by Kips Bay Investments, LLC could have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and applicable provisions of Delaware law may make it more difficult for or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions:\n\u25cf\nset limitations on the removal of directors;\n\u25cf\nlimit who may call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u25cf\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf\ndo not permit cumulative voting in the election of our directors, which would otherwise permit less than a majority of stockholders to elect directors;\n\u25cf\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent unless unanimous, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u25cf\nprovide our board of directors the ability to designate the terms of and issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally limits our ability to engage in any business combination with certain persons who own 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or any of our associates or affiliates who at any time in the past three years have owned 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive stockholders of the opportunity to sell their shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation allows us to authorize and issue preferred stock with rights and preferences superior to our common stock without stockholder approval, and the terms of any preferred stock issued may reduce the value of our common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our board of directors may determine the terms of future preferred stock offerings without further action by our stockholders, other than Kips Bay Investments, LLC. Prior to issuing any capital stock with rights, preferences or limitations equal or superior to our common stock owned by Kips Bay Investments, LLC or debt securities convertible into capital stock with rights, preferences or limitations equal or superior to our common stock owned by Kips Bay Investments, LLC, we must obtain the consent of Kips Bay Investments, LLC. If we issue preferred stock, it could affect your rights or reduce the value of our outstanding common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, sinking fund provisions, and restrictions on our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party.\nWe do not intend to declare dividends on our common stock and stockholders should not expect to receive dividends on their common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business and, therefore, do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, future prospects, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Therefore, our stockholders should not expect to receive dividend income from shares of our common stock.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, the price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nWe are required to establish and maintain appropriate internal controls over financial reporting. Failure to establish those controls, or any failure of those controls once established, could adversely impact our public disclosures regarding our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any failure of these controls could also prevent us from maintaining accurate accounting records and discovering accounting errors and financial fraud. Rules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act require annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.\nIn addition, management\u2019s assessment of internal controls over financial reporting may identify additional weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed or other potential matters that may raise concerns for investors. Any actual or perceived weaknesses and conditions that need to be addressed in our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure of management\u2019s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting may have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 12580, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "KIPS"}
