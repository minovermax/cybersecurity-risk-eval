Risk Factors\nListed below are some of the more critical or unique risk factors that we have identified as affecting or potentially affecting the Company. You should carefully consider these risks and the risks identified elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K and in the notes to the financial statements included in this report when evaluating our forward-looking statements and our Company. The effect of any one risk factor or a combination of several risk factors could materially affect our business and the accuracy of the forward-looking statements and other information provided in this annual report on Form 10-K. These risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence.\nWe have no operations and minimal assets, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to return any additional value to our stockholders.\nWe no longer have operations and as a result of the Sale, the repayment of our outstanding notes, the first and second cash distributions to our stockholders and the winding up of our operations in Kazakhstan, we have very limited assets. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern or to return any additional value to our stockholders. While we will continue to look for opportunities as time and financial resources allow, there is no guarantee that we will we be able to successful in our efforts. If we are not successful, our management and the board of directors may determine it to be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to liquidate the Company and terminate its existence, which would result in a complete loss in the value of the common stock of the Company.\nShareholders who hold unregistered shares of our common stock are subject to resale restrictions pursuant to Rule 144, due to our status as a \u201cshell company.\u201d\nPursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\u201cRule 144\u201d), a \u201cshell company\u201d is defined as a company that has no or nominal operations; and, either no or nominal assets; assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets. As such, we are a shell company pursuant to Rule 144, and as such, sales of our securities pursuant to Rule 144 are not able to be made until: 1) we have ceased to be a shell company; 2) we have filed all of our required periodic reports for at least the previous one year period prior to any sale pursuant to Rule 144; and 3) a period of at least twelve months has elapsed from the date \u201cForm 10 information\u201d (i.e., information similar to that which would be found in a Form 10 Registration Statement filing with the SEC) has been filed with the Commission reflecting the Company\u2019s status as a non-shell company. Because none of our non-registered securities can be sold pursuant to Rule 144, until at least a year after we cease to be a shell company, any non-registered securities we sell in the future or issue to management or service providers in consideration for services rendered or for any other purpose will have no liquidity until and unless such securities are registered with the Commission and/or until a year after we cease to be a shell company and have complied with the other requirements of Rule 144, as described above. As a result, it may be harder for us to pay management or other service providers with our securities instead of cash. Furthermore, it will be harder for us to raise funding through the sale of debt or equity securities unless we agree to register such securities with the Commission, which could cause us to expend additional resources in the future. Our status as a shell company could prevent us from raising additional funds, engaging service providers, and using our securities to pay for any acquisitions, which could cause the value of our securities, if any, to decline in value or become worthless.\nOur independent auditor has issued a report questioning our ability to continue as a going concern. This report may impair our ability to raise additional financing and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe report of our independent auditor contained in our financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 includes a paragraph that explains that we have no continuing operations that result in positive cash flow. This raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Reports of independent auditors questioning a company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern are generally viewed unfavorably by analysts and investors. This report may make it difficult for us to raise additional financing, if sought, to make an acquisition, or to pursue a new opportunity if one is identified. We urge you to review this report before making any investment decision.\nManagement and the board of directors may be unable to provide sufficient time to seeking a new business opportunity, which may adversely impact our ability to identify and exploit a new business opportunity to return additonal value to our stockholders.\nOur ability to successfully identify a new business opportunity to exploit will be dependent upon the efforts of our management and board of directors. As we no longer have sufficient funds to compensate our management and board members for their services, those individuals are involved in other business activities and they may have limited financial ability to devote significant time to the Company. If our management and board of directors have insufficient time to devote to identify and exploit a new business opportunity, the likelihood of our success in this endeavor will be adversely impacted which would likewise adversely impact our ability to return additonal value to our stockholders.\nThe board of directors may determine it to be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to liquidate and terminate the Company\u2019s existence.\nBased on the advice of management regarding potential business opportunities available to the Company, or the lack thereof, or the advice of the Company\u2019s tax, accounting, legal or other experts, our board of directors may, at any time, determine it to be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to liquidate the Company and terminate its existence. Such action would result in a complete loss in the value of the common stock of the Company.\nIf we are unsuccessful in obtaining a source of capital to meet our ongoing expenses, we may be forced to liquidate and terminate the Company\u2019s existence.\nWe have very limited capital to fund our efforts to identify new business opportunities. While we continue to incur expenses, we do not currently generate any revenue nor do we expect to do so until such time as we can make an acquisition or exploit an opportunity that would allow us to generate revenue. There is no guarantee we will be able to do so. Similarly, there is no guarantee that if we were to identify an opportunity we would have sufficient funds then available to us to enable us to make an acquisition or exploit such an opportunity. Given our current situation, economic conditions could materially adversely affect our ability to obtain credit or access the capital markets to fund an acquisition or exploit a new business opportunity, which would make it very difficult to pursue a new opportunity. If we are unable to pursue a new opportunity prior to expending the very limited funds we have remaining, we may be forced to liquidate and terminate the Company\u2019s existence which would result in a complete loss in the value of the common stock of the Company.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nIf the existence of the Company is terminated, our common stock will cease to exist or trade on any market.\nAt any time, management and the board of directors could determine that it is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to liquidate the Company and terminate its existence. In the event the Company\u2019s existence is terminated, our common stock will cease to exist and there will be no market for our common stock. This would result in a complete loss in the value of our common stock.\nOur common stock is subject to the Commission\u2019s penny stock rules, which may make it difficult for broker-dealers to complete customer transactions and adversely affect trading activity in our securities.\nAny time we have net tangible assets of $5.0 million or less and our common stock has a market price per share of less than $5.00, transactions in our common stock will be subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules promulgated under the Exchange Act. Under these rules, broker-dealers who recommend such securities to persons other than institutional accredited investors must:\n\u2022\nmake a special written suitability determination for the purchaser;\n\u2022\nreceive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to a transaction prior to sale;\n\u2022\nprovide the purchaser with risk disclosure documents that identify certain risks associated with investing in \u201cpenny stocks\u201d and that describe the market for the \u201cpenny stocks,\u201d as we as a purchaser\u2019s legal remedies: and\n\u2022\nobtain a signed and dated acknowledgement from the purchaser demonstrating that the purchaser has actually received the required risk disclosure document before a transaction in a \u201cpenny stock\u201d can be completed.\nWhen our common stock is subject to these rules, broker-dealers may find it difficult to effect customer transactions and trading activity in our securities may be adversely affected. As a result, the market price of our securities may be depressed, and you may find it more difficult to sell our securities.", "PERMNO": 91437, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "FRHC"}
