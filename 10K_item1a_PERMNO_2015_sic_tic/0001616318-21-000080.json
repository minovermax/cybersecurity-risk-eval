RISK FACTORS\nWe operate in a rapidly changing business environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The following discussion addresses risks and uncertainties that could cause, or contribute to causing, our actual results to differ from our expectations in material ways. These risks and uncertainties, or other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also may affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The trading price of our common stock could also decline due to any of these risks. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the financial statements and related notes included in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our business, revenues, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has severely impacted levels of economic activity around the world. In response to this pandemic, governments and public health officials of many countries, states, cities, and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions to mitigate the spread and severity of COVID-19, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations and advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes by imposing shelter-in-place orders. We cannot predict the ultimate scope and duration of the pandemic and related business shutdowns or disruptions to our business, but the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic and commercial shutdowns to date have negatively impacted our ability to conduct business in accordance with our plans. Disruptions to our business include restrictions on the ability of our sales and marketing personnel to travel, disruptions to our global supply chain, disruptions in manufacturing, and reduced demand and/or suspension of operations by our customers. A number of our retail customers have been forced to temporarily close their businesses, which has resulted in decreased orders for many of our products, which has negatively impacted our revenue.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending, and we cannot predict the degree to, or the time period over, which our business will continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although a number of vaccines are now available to treat the coronavirus, there are still numerous uncertainties associated with the pandemic, including the efficacy of the vaccines and their ability to protect against new strains of the virus, people\u2019s willingness to receive a vaccine, possible resurgences of the coronavirus and/or new strains of the virus, the duration of store closures or occupancy restrictions, the extent and duration of protective and preventative measures that may be adopted by local, state and/or the federal government in the future as a result of future outbreaks, the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. and world economy and consumer confidence, and various other uncertainties. Even if the virus is contained and our retail customers are able to resume normal operations, any significant reduction in consumer willingness to visit retail stores, the levels of consumer discretionary spending, or employee willingness to return to work would result in a further loss of revenues and cash flows.\nCompetition in our industry may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy, maintain profitability or maintain relationships with existing customers.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and we compete against other manufacturers that have well-established brand names and strong market positions. Given the diversity of our product portfolio, we have various significant competitors in each of our markets, including: Nikon and Vortex in the optics market; Hydro Flask, Contigo, Yeti, Osprey, and Nalgene in the hydration systems market; Traeger, Pit Boss, Blackstone, and Lodge in the outdoor cooking market; Schwinn, Bontrager, Smith, Specialized, and Shoei in the bike and snow helmet and accessories markets; Garmin and Nikon in the golf electronics market; Winchester Ammunition of Olin Corporation, and various smaller manufacturers and importers, including Black Hills Ammunition, CBC Group, Fiocchi Ammunition, Hornady, PMC, Rio Ammunition, and Wolf in the ammunition market.\nCompetition in the markets in which we operate is based on a number of factors, including price, quality, product innovation, performance, reliability, styling, product features and warranties, as well as sales and marketing programs. Competition could result in price reductions, reduced profits or losses or loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Certain of our competitors may be more diversified than us or may have financial and marketing resources that are substantially greater than ours, which may allow them to invest more heavily in intellectual property, product development and advertising. Since many of our competitors also source their products from third-parties, our ability to obtain a cost advantage through sourcing is reduced.\nCertain of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower profit margins to compete with us. Further, retailers often demand that suppliers reduce their prices on mature products, which could lead to lower margins.\nOur products typically face more competition internationally where foreign competitors manufacture and market products in their respective countries, which allows those competitors to sell products at lower prices, which could adversely affect our competitiveness.\nIn addition, our products compete with many other sporting and recreational products for the discretionary spending of consumers. Failure to effectively compete with these competitors or alternative products could have a material adverse effect on our performance.\nOur revenues and results of operations may fluctuate unexpectedly from quarter-to-quarter, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur revenues and results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future due to various factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022market acceptance of our products and services;\n\u2022general economic conditions;\n\u2022the timing of large domestic and international orders;\n\u2022cancellation of existing orders;\n\u2022the outcome of any existing or future litigation;\n\u2022adverse publicity surrounding our products, the safety of our products or the use of our products;\n\u2022changes in our sales mix;\n\u2022new product introduction costs;\n\u2022complexity in our integrated supply chain;\n\u2022increased raw material expenses;\n\u2022changes in amount and/or timing of our operating expenses;\n\u2022natural disasters and public health crises or other significant catastrophic events, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, in markets in which we, our customers, suppliers and manufacturers operate; and\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations that may affect the marketability of our products.\nAs a result of these and other factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful in the short term, and our performance in a particular period may not be indicative of our performance in any future period.\nOur results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to forecast demand for our products accurately.\nWe often schedule internal production and place orders for products with third-party suppliers before receiving firm orders from our customers. If we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products to deliver to our customers. Factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include:\n\u2022an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products or for the products of our competitors;\n\u2022our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance of new products;\n\u2022new product introductions by competitors;\n\u2022changes in our relationships with customers;\n\u2022changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers, including as a result of natural disasters and public health crises or other significant catastrophic events, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations governing the activities for which we sell products, such as hunting and shooting sports;\n\u2022weak economic conditions or consumer confidence, which could reduce demand for discretionary items such as our products; and\n\u2022the domestic political environment, including debate over the regulation of ammunition and related products.\nInventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If we underestimate demand for our products, our manufacturing facilities or third-party suppliers may not be able to create products to meet customer demand, and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues, as well as damage to our reputation and customer relationships. We may not be able to manage inventory levels successfully to meet future order and reorder requirements.\nWe may need to raise additional capital, and we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available.\nWe will need to fund our ongoing working capital, capital expenditures and financing requirements through cash flows from operations and new sources of financing. Our ability to obtain future financing will depend on, among other things, our financial condition and results of operations as well as on the condition of the capital markets or other credit markets at the time we seek financing. Increased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets, including as a result of natural disasters and public health crises or other significant catastrophic events, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain financing. We cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets or other credit markets on terms we find acceptable or at all.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our debt restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to incur debt that we may need to fund initiatives in response to changes in our business, the industries in which we operate, the economy and governmental regulations.\nOur sales are highly dependent on purchases by several large retail customers, and we may be adversely affected by the loss of, or any significant decline in sales to, one or more of these customers.\nThe U.S. retail industry serving the outdoor recreation market has become relatively concentrated. Sales to the top ten customers accounted for approximately 40% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal year 2021. Further consolidation in the U.S. retail industry could increase the concentration of our retail store customer base in the future.\nAlthough we have long-established relationships with many of our retail customers, as is typical in the markets in which we compete, we do not have long-term purchase agreements with our customers. As such, we are dependent on individual purchase orders. As a result, these retail customers would be able to cancel their orders, change purchase quantities from forecast volumes, delay purchases, change other terms of our business relationship or cease to purchase our products entirely. Our customers\u2019 purchasing activity may also be impacted by general economic conditions as well as natural disasters and public health crises or other significant catastrophic events, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic. For example, several large retail outdoor products retailers have recently closed many of their locations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in reduced orders from those customers and negatively impacted sales revenue for several of our brands. A continuation of such store closures, or further closures after reopening because of a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic, would have an adverse effect on our future sales revenue.\nThe loss of any one or more of our retail customers or significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in purchases or changes in business practices by our retail customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations including but not limited to reductions in sales volumes and profits, inability to collect receivables, and increases in inventory levels.\nWe rely on an outside supplier for certain of our ammunition products.\nBeginning on October 1, 2020, management and control of the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant transitioned to Olin Corporation\u2019s Winchester business, which is a competitor of our ammunition business. After expiration of our current two-year supply agreement with Winchester, we may not be able to purchase Lake City Army Ammunition Plant products from Winchester on favorable terms or at all, and we may not be able to purchase ammunition products to replace the products we currently purchase from the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant from another supplier. If we fail to maintain an adequate supply of such ammunition products, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSignificant supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality issues or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products.\nOur reliance on third-party suppliers for various product components and finished goods exposes us to volatility in the availability, quality and price of these product components and finished goods. A disruption in deliveries from our third-party suppliers, including as a result of natural disasters and public health crises or other significant catastrophic events, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. For example, the closure of certain of our suppliers' manufacturing operations in Asia in response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic temporarily affected the availability of new products for certain of our brands in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and first and second quarter of fiscal year 2021, which had a negative impact on our revenue. Future closures of our suppliers' manufacturing operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our revenue in future periods.\nOur inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components, parts, raw materials and other supplies from independent sources necessary for the production of our products could also result in reduced or delayed sales or lost orders. Any delay in or loss of sales or orders could adversely impact our results of operations. Many of the components, parts, raw materials and other supplies used in the production of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers. We do not have long-term supply contracts with some of these suppliers. As a result, we could be subject to increased costs, supply interruptions or orders and difficulties in obtaining materials. Our suppliers also may encounter difficulties or increased costs in obtaining the materials necessary to produce their products that we use in our products. The time lost in seeking and acquiring new sources could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nQuality issues experienced by third-party suppliers could also adversely affect the quality and effectiveness of our products and result in liability and reputational harm.\nWe face risks relating to our international business operations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new international markets is subject to risks associated with our doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022issues related to managing international operations;\n\u2022potentially adverse tax developments;\n\u2022lack of sufficient protection for intellectual property in some countries;\n\u2022currency exchange;\n\u2022import and export controls;\n\u2022social, political, and economic instability in the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022changes in economic conditions;\n\u2022the occurrence of natural disasters, public health crises or other significant catastrophic events, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, in countries in which we operate;\n\u2022local laws and regulations, including those governing labor, product safety and environmental protection;\n\u2022changes to international treaties and regulations; and\n\u2022limitations on our ability to efficiently repatriate cash from our foreign operations.\nAny one or more of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. and global trade policies, including new and potential tariffs on goods we import or on products we export to other countries, could increase our cost of goods or limit our access to export markets.\nIn recent years, protectionist trade policies have been increasing around the world, including in the U.S. It is unclear what additional tariffs, duties, border taxes or other similar assessments on imports might be implemented in the future and what effects these changes may have on retail markets or our operating performance. Additional protectionist trade legislation in either the U.S. or foreign countries, including changes in the current tariff structures, export or import compliance laws, or other trade policies, could reduce our ability to sell our products in foreign markets, the ability of foreign customers to purchase our products, and our ability to import components, parts, and products from foreign suppliers. In particular, increases in tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. could increase the cost to us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such merchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our business.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other applicable anti-corruption legislation, as well as export controls and trade sanctions, could result in fines or criminal penalties.\nThe international nature of our business exposes us to trade sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the U.S. and other governments. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, Treasury and other agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against companies for violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), export controls, anti-boycott provisions and other federal statutes, sanctions, and regulations and, increasingly,\nsimilar or more restrictive foreign laws, rules and regulations, which may also apply to us. In recent years, U.S. and foreign governments have increased their oversight and enforcement activities with respect to these laws and we expect the relevant agencies to continue to increase their enforcement efforts.\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the FCPA, or the laws and regulations of other countries, such as the UK Bribery Act. We maintain a policy, Code of Business Ethics, prohibiting such business practices. Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.\nBy virtue of these laws and regulations we may be obliged to limit our business activities, we may incur costs for compliance programs and we may be subject to enforcement actions or penalties for noncompliance. A violation of these laws, sanctions or regulations could result in restrictions on our exports, civil and criminal fines or penalties and could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSeasonality and weather conditions may cause our results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter.\nBecause many of the products we sell are used for seasonal outdoor sporting activities, our results of operations may be significantly impacted by unseasonable weather conditions. For example, our winter sport accessories sales are dependent on cold winter weather and snowfall, and can be negatively impacted by unseasonably warm or dry weather. Conversely, sales of our spring and summer products, such as golf accessories, can be adversely impacted by unseasonably cold or wet weather. Accordingly, our sales results and financial condition will typically suffer when weather patterns do not conform to seasonal norms.\nSales of our hunting accessories are highest during the months of August through December due to shipments around the fall hunting season and holidays. In addition, sales of our ammunition have historically been lower in our first fiscal quarter. The seasonality of our sales may change in the future. Seasonal variations in our results of operations may reduce our cash on hand, increase our inventory levels and extend our accounts receivable collection periods. This in turn may cause us to increase our debt levels and interest expense to fund our working capital requirements.\nOur success depends upon our ability to introduce new compelling products into the marketplace and respond to customer preferences.\nOur efforts to introduce new products into the marketplace may not be successful, and any new products that we introduce may not result in customer or market acceptance. We both develop and source new products that we believe will match customer preferences. The development of new products is a lengthy and costly process and may not result in the development of a successful product. In addition, the sourcing of our products is dependent, in part, on our relationships with our third-party suppliers. If we are unable to maintain these relationships, we may not be able to continue to source products at competitive prices that both meet our standards and appeal to our customers. Failure to develop or source and introduce new products that consumers want to buy could decrease our sales, operating margins and market share and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEven if we are able to develop or source new products, our efforts to introduce new products may be costly and ineffective. When introducing a new product, we incur expenses and expend resources to market, promote and sell the new product. New products that we introduce into the marketplace may be unsuccessful or may achieve success that does not meet our expectations for a variety of reasons, including failure to predict market demand, delays in introduction, unfavorable cost comparisons with alternative products and unfavorable performance. Significant expenses related to new products that prove to be unsuccessful for any reason will adversely affect our results of operations.\nCustomer preferences include the choice of sales channels. We may not be able to successfully respond to shifting preferences of the end consumer from brick and mortar retail to online retail. Our efforts to introduce new sales channels to respond to such a shift may be costly and ineffective.\nSome of our products contain licensed, third-party technology that provides important product functionality and features. The loss or inability to obtain and maintain any such licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSome of our products contain technology licensed from third-parties that provides important product functionality and features. We cannot assure you that we will have continued access to this technology. For example, if the licensing company ceases to exist, either as a result of bankruptcy, dissolution or purchase by a competitor, we may lose access to important third-\nparty technology and may not be able to obtain replacement technology on favorable terms or at all. In addition, legal actions, such as intellectual property actions, brought against the licensing company could impact our future access to the technology. Any of these actions could negatively affect our technology licenses, thereby reducing the functionality and features of our products, and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe manufacture and sell products that create exposure to potential product liability, warranty liability or personal injury claims and litigation.\nSome of our products are used in applications and situations that involve risk of personal injury and death. Our products expose us to potential product liability, warranty liability, and personal injury claims and litigation relating to the use or misuse of our products including allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product or activities associated with the product, negligence and strict liability. If successful, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDefects in our products could reduce demand for our products and result in a decrease in sales and market acceptance and damage to our reputation.\nComplex components and assemblies used in our products may contain undetected defects that are subsequently discovered at any point in the life of the product. In addition, we obtain many of our products and component parts from third-party suppliers and may not be able to detect defects in such products or component parts until after they are sold. Defects in our products may result in a loss of sales, recall expenses, delay in market acceptance and damage to our reputation and increased warranty costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAlthough we maintain product liability insurance in amounts that we believe are reasonable, we may not be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, in the future and product liability claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage. In addition, our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about our products.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and could incur fines, penalties and other costs and liabilities under such requirements.\nLike other global manufacturers and distributors of consumer products, we are required to comply with a wide variety of federal, state and international laws, rules and regulations, including those related to consumer products and consumer protection, advertising and marketing, labor and employment, data protection and privacy, intellectual property, workplace safety, the environment, the import and export of products, and tax. See Item 1 \u201cBusiness-Regulatory Matters\u201d of this Annual Report for a description of the various laws and regulations to which our business is subject. Our failure to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations may result in our being subject to claims, lawsuits, fines and adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. These laws, rules and regulations currently impose significant compliance requirements on our business, and more restrictive laws, rules and regulations may be adopted in the future.\nChanges in government policies and firearms and ammunition legislation could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe sale, purchase, ownership and use of firearms and ammunition are subject to numerous and varied federal, state and local governmental regulations. Sales of our ammunition products are heavily correlated with sales of firearms, and legislation restricting the sale or use of firearms could negatively affect sales of our ammunition products. Federal laws governing firearms and ammunition include the National Firearms Act, the Federal Firearms Act, the Arms Export Control Act and the Gun Control Act of 1968. These laws generally govern the manufacture, import, export, sale and possession of firearms and ammunition. We hold all necessary licenses to legally sell ammunition in the U.S.\nIn recent years, federal and state legislatures have increased their attention on the regulation of firearms and ammunition. The bills proposed to date are extremely varied. If enacted, such legislation could effectively ban or severely limit sale of certain categories of firearms, which would negatively impact sales of our related ammunition products. We cannot be assured that the regulation of our business activities will not become more restrictive in the future and that any such restrictions will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf our efforts to protect the security of personal information about our customers and consumers are unsuccessful and unauthorized access to that personal information is obtained, or we experience a significant disruption in our computer systems or a cybersecurity breach, we could experience an adverse effect on our operations, we could be subject to costly government enforcement action and private litigation and our reputation could suffer.\nOur operations, especially our retail operations, involve the storage and transmission of our customers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 proprietary information, such as credit card and bank account numbers, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, government enforcement action and litigation and possible liability. Our payment services may be susceptible to credit card and other payment fraud schemes, including unauthorized use of credit cards, debit cards or bank account information, identity theft or merchant fraud.\nIf our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to our customers\u2019 and consumers\u2019 data, our reputation may be damaged, our business may suffer, and we could incur significant liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose customers and consumers, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe also rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering, pricing, inventory replenishment and other processes. Our systems could be subject to damage or interruption from various sources, including power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber security breaches, vandalism, severe weather conditions, catastrophic events and human error, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with acquisitions, which could adversely affect our future financial results.\nOur business strategy includes growth through acquisitions or other transactions. The expected benefits of any future acquisitions or other transactions may not be realized. Costs could be incurred on pursuits or proposed acquisitions that may never close that could significantly impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, after any acquisition, unforeseen issues and/or costs could arise that adversely affect our anticipated returns or that are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after careful integration efforts, actual results of operations may vary significantly from initial estimates due to a variety of factors, including general economic conditions affecting the market for our products.\nFurthermore, if, due to declining market conditions or other factors, we determine that the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets associated with an acquired business exceeds the fair value of such assets, we may be required to record a significant impairment charge in the period during which such determination was made, which would negatively affect our results of operations. For example, in fiscal year 2020 we recorded impairment charges to the goodwill and identifiable indefinite-lived intangible assets associated with the Outdoor Recreation reporting unit.\nWe may engage in other strategic business transactions. Such transactions could result in unanticipated costs and difficulties, may not achieve intended results and may require significant time and attention from management, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks may also include potential delays in adopting our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures, greater than anticipated costs and expenses related to the integration of the acquired business with our business, potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired company, challenges inherent in effectively managing an increased number of employees in diverse locations and the challenge of creating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies, and information systems. These and other risks relating to our acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business is highly dependent upon our brand recognition and reputation, and the failure to maintain or enhance our brand recognition or reputation would likely have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur brand recognition and reputation are critical aspects of our business. We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands as well as our reputation are critical to retaining existing customers and attracting new customers. We also believe that the importance of our brand recognition and reputation will continue to increase as competition in the markets in which we compete continues to develop.\nOur future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our advertising, promotion, public relations and marketing programs. These brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue and the effectiveness of these activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022determine the appropriate creative message, media mix and markets for advertising, marketing and promotional initiatives and expenditures;\n\u2022identify the most effective and efficient level of spending in each market, medium and specific media vehicle; and\n\u2022effectively manage marketing costs, including creative and media expenses, in order to maintain acceptable customer acquisition costs.\nWe may implement new marketing and advertising strategies with significantly higher costs than our current channels, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Implementing new marketing and advertising strategies could also increase the risk of devoting significant capital and other resources to endeavors that do not prove to be cost effective. We also may incur marketing and advertising expenses significantly in advance of the time we anticipate recognizing revenue associated with such expenses, and our marketing and advertising expenditures may not generate sufficient levels of brand awareness or result in increased revenue. Even if our marketing and advertising expenses result in increased revenue, the increase in revenue might not offset our related marketing and advertising expenditures. If we are unable to maintain our marketing and advertising channels on cost-effective terms or replace or supplement existing marketing and advertising channels with similarly or more cost-effective channels, our marketing and advertising expenses could increase substantially, our customer base could be adversely affected and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, certain of our products and brands benefit from endorsements and support from particular sporting enthusiasts, athletes or other celebrities, and those products and brands may become personally associated with those individuals. As a result, sales of the endorsed products could be materially and adversely affected if any of those individuals\u2019 images, reputations or popularity were to be negatively impacted.\nUse of social media to disseminate negative commentary and boycotts may adversely impact our business.\nThere has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms, including blogs, social media websites, and other forms of internet-based communications, which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Negative commentary regarding us or our brands may be posted on social media platforms at any time and may have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, or relationships with third-parties, including suppliers, customers, investors, and lenders. Consumers value readily available information and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy or context. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.\nSocial media platforms also provide users with access to such a broad audience that collective action, such as boycotts, can be more easily organized. Such actions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and or cash flows.\nFurther, we serve the outdoor sports and recreation markets through a diverse portfolio of 34 brands that appeal to a broad range of end consumers. The perspectives of the broad range of consumers we serve are varied and can cause conflicting views across brands.\nWe may incur substantial litigation costs to protect our intellectual property, and if we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may lose our competitive advantage. We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which could cause us to incur litigation costs and divert management attention from our business.\nOur future success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. Our protective measures, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret protection and internet identity registrations, may prove inadequate to protect our proprietary rights and market advantage. The right to stop others from misusing our trademarks and service marks in commerce depends, to some extent, on our ability to show evidence of enforcement of our rights against such misuse in commerce. Our failure to stop the misuse by others of our trademarks and service marks may lead to our loss of trademark and service mark rights, brand loyalty and notoriety among our customers and prospective customers. The scope of any patent to which we have or may obtain rights may not prevent others from developing and selling competing products. In addition, our patents may be held invalid upon challenge, or others may claim rights in, or ownership of, our patents. Moreover, we may become subject to litigation with parties that claim, among other matters, that we infringed their patents or other intellectual property rights. The defense and prosecution of patent and other intellectual property claims are both costly and time-consuming and could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial position.\nAlso, any intellectual property infringement claims against us, with or without merit, could be costly and time-consuming to defend and divert our management's attention from our business. If our products were found to infringe a third-party's proprietary rights, we could be forced to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements in order to be able to continue to sell our products or discontinue use of the protected technology. Such royalty and licensing agreements may not be available on\nterms acceptable to us or at all. Rights holders may demand payment for past infringements or force us to accept costly license terms or discontinue use of protected technology or works of authorship.\nWe may become involved in litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Other companies, including our competitors, may develop intellectual property that is similar or superior to our intellectual property, duplicate our intellectual property or design around our patents, and may have or obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products. Effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries in which we sell products or from which competing products may be sold.\nUnauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise use aspects of our intellectual property and products that we regard as proprietary. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the U.S. or abroad may prove to be inadequate, and competitors may be able to develop similar intellectual property independently. If our intellectual property protection is insufficient to protect our intellectual property rights, we could face increased competition in the markets for our products.\nShould any of our competitors file patent applications or obtain patents that claim inventions also claimed by us, we may choose to participate in an interference proceeding to determine the right to a patent for these inventions because our business could be harmed if we fail to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights. Even if the outcome is favorable, an interference proceeding could result in substantial costs to us and disrupt our business.\nIn the future, we also may need to file lawsuits to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nShortages of, and price increases for, labor, components, parts and other supplies, as well as commodities used in the manufacture and distribution of our products, may delay or reduce our sales and increase our costs, thereby harming our results of operations.\nWe manufacture a significant portion of our products at plants that we own, including ammunition products. Shortages of, and cost increases for, labor and other inputs to the manufacturing process could delay or reduce our sales and reduce our gross margins and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we manufacture many of the components for our products, we purchase from third-parties finished goods, important components, and parts. The costs of these components and parts are affected by commodity prices and are, therefore, subject to price volatility caused by weather, market conditions and other factors that are not predictable or within our control, including natural disasters and public health crises or other significant catastrophic events, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic. We also use numerous commodity materials in producing and testing our products, including copper, lead, plastics, steel, wood, and zinc. Commodity prices could increase, and any such increase in commodity prices may harm our results of operations.\nHigher prices for electricity, natural gas, metals, and fuel increase our production and shipping costs. A significant shortage, increased prices or interruptions in the availability of these commodities would increase the costs of producing and delivering products to our customers and would be likely to negatively affect our earnings. Commodity costs have varied significantly during recent fiscal years and remain a volatile element of our costs.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nA disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, public health crisis (such as the global COVID-19 pandemic), cyber-attack, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services or performing other mission-critical functions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our results of operations.\nIn addition, damage or disruption to our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or those of our suppliers because of a major earthquake, weather event, public health crisis, cyber-attack, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could impair our ability or our suppliers' ability to manufacture or sell our products. If we do not take steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nSome of our products involve the manufacture or handling of a variety of explosive and flammable materials. From time to time, these activities have resulted in incidents that have temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupted some manufacturing processes, causing production delays and resulting in liability for workplace injuries and fatalities. We have safety and loss prevention programs that require detailed pre-construction reviews of process changes and new operations, along with routine\nsafety audits of operations involving explosive materials, to mitigate such incidents, as well as a variety of insurance policies. We cannot assure you, however, that we will not experience similar incidents in the future or that any similar incidents will not result in production delays or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions affect our results of operations.\nOur revenues are affected by economic conditions and consumer confidence worldwide, but especially in the U.S. In times of economic uncertainty, consumers tend to defer expenditures for discretionary items, which affects demand for our products. Moreover, our businesses are cyclical in nature, and their success is impacted by general economic conditions and specific economic conditions affecting the regions and markets we serve, the overall level of consumer confidence in the economy and discretionary income levels. Any substantial deterioration in general economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, that diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income could reduce our sales and adversely affect our financial results. Moreover, declining economic conditions create the potential for future impairments of goodwill and other intangible and long-lived assets that may negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations. The impact of weak consumer credit markets, corporate restructurings, layoffs, high unemployment rates, declines in the value of investments and residential real estate, higher fuel prices and increases in federal and state taxation can also negatively affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, in recent periods sluggish economies and consumer uncertainty regarding future economic prospects in our key markets have had an adverse effect on the financial health of certain of our customers, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We extend credit to our customers for periods of varying duration based on an assessment of the customer\u2019s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral, which increases our exposure to the risk of uncollectible receivables. In addition, we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. Our risk of uncollectible receivables and order cancellations has recently been elevated as a result of retail store closures in many locations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has adversely affected many of our customers. We may reduce our level of business with customers and distributors experiencing financial difficulties and may not be able to replace that business with other customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In times of uncertain economic conditions there is also increased risk that inventories may not be liquidated in an efficient manner and may result in us having excess levels of inventory.\nFailure to attract and retain key personnel could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur future success will depend in part on the continued service of key personnel and our ability to attract, retain and develop key managers, designers, sales and information technology professionals and others. We face intense competition for these individuals worldwide. We may not be able to attract qualified new employees or retain existing employees, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur results of operations could be impacted by unanticipated changes in tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities.\nOur business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose income taxes. Changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. In addition, audits by income tax authorities could result in unanticipated increases in our income tax expense.\nIn particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations in the U.S., including tax reform under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the '2017 Tax Act'), which includes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, and the state tax response to the 2017 Tax Act, including, but not limited to variability in our future tax rate.\nOur debt covenants may limit our ability to complete acquisitions, incur debt, make investments, sell assets, merge or complete other significant transactions.\nOur 2021 ABL Revolving Credit Facility contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and limits our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests, including restrictions on our, and our subsidiaries', ability to:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or sell disqualified or preferred stock;\n\u2022pay dividends on, make distributions in respect of, repurchase or redeem, capital stock;\n\u2022make investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of certain assets;\n\u2022create liens;\n\u2022enter into sale/leaseback transactions;\n\u2022enter into agreements restricting the ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transfers;\n\u2022consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our or our subsidiaries' assets;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022prepay, repurchase or redeem certain kinds of indebtedness;\n\u2022issue or sell stock of our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022significantly change the nature of our business.\nThe indenture governing our 4.5% Notes also contains many of these same restrictions. As a result of all of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022limited in how we conduct our business and pursue our strategy;\n\u2022unable to raise additional debt financing that we may require to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nA failure to comply with the covenants in the 2021 ABL Revolving Credit Facility could result in an event of default under the 2021 ABL Revolving Credit Facility, which could allow our creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and proceed against the collateral that secures such indebtedness. Similarly, a failure to comply with the covenants in the indenture governing our 4.5% Notes could result in an event of default thereunder, which could allow the holders of the 4.5% Notes to accelerate such notes. The 2021 ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the indenture governing the 4.5% Notes contain cross-default provisions so that noncompliance with the covenants of any of our other debt agreements could cause a default under these debt agreements as well. In the event our creditors accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay our indebtedness.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nOur indebtedness as of March 31, 2021 does not include any outstanding variable rate debt. However, any future borrowings against the 2021 ABL Revolving Credit Facility would be subject to interest rate variability. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness will increase even if the amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows will correspondingly decrease. Even if we enter into additional interest rate swaps in the future in order to reduce future interest rate volatility, we may not fully mitigate our future interest rate risk.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, approximately 14% of our revenue was generated from sales outside the U.S. Revenues from foreign operations (and the related expense) are often transacted in foreign currencies or valued based on a currency other than U.S. dollars. For the purposes of financial reporting, this revenue is translated into U.S. dollars. Resulting gains and losses from foreign currency fluctuations are therefore included in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, when the U.S. dollar strengthens against certain foreign currencies, including the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, and other major currencies, our reportable revenue in U.S. dollars generated from sales made in foreign currencies may decrease substantially. As a result, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the Spin-Off is found to be taxable under the Internal Revenue Code we may be obligated to indemnify Orbital ATK.\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement entered into by Orbital ATK and Vista Outdoor, we were prohibited from taking actions that could reasonably be expected to cause the Spin-Off to be taxable or to jeopardize the conclusions of the opinions of counsel received by Orbital ATK. We have not taken any such actions during the period specified in the Tax Matters Agreement, but if the Spin-Off does not qualify as a tax-free spin-off under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\"), then we may become subject to litigation regarding whether we are obligated to indemnify Orbital ATK under the Tax Matters Agreement.\nProvisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Amended and Restated Bylaws, and Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nSeveral provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable. These include provisions that:\n\u2022allow our Board of Directors to authorize for issuance, without stockholder approval, preferred stock, the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors and, if issued, could operate as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors does not approve;\n\u2022prohibit our stockholders from taking action by written consent and require that stockholder action must take place at a duly called annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022establish how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022mandate that stockholders may only remove directors for cause;\n\u2022grant exclusive privilege (subject to certain limited exceptions) to our directors, and not our stockholders, to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors;\n\u2022provide that only our Board of Directors, Chairman of our Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer or the President (in the absence of the Chief Executive Officer) are entitled to call a special meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u2022limit our ability to enter into business combination transactions with certain stockholders.\nThese and other provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or a threatened acquisition or change in control of us, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock at a price above the prevailing market price.", "PERMNO": 15168, "SIC": 3480, "TIC": "VSTO"}
