{"cik": "1237746", "company": "Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected by the following risks or uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but they are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, including overall economic and industry conditions, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. If any of such risks and uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could differ materially from the plans, projections and other forward-looking statements included in the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report and in our other public filings.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may be adversely affected due to a variety of factors, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below investor or analyst expectations.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may be adversely affected due to a variety of factors that could affect our revenue or our expenses in any particular period. You should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of future performance. Factors that may adversely affect our quarterly and annual operating results may include:\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new subscribers, and retain existing subscribers;\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire subscribers in a cost-effective way;\n\u2022\nour ability to increase revenue from our existing subscribers;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain a high level of subscriber satisfaction;\n\u2022\nour inability to raise the selling prices for our solutions or reductions in the selling prices for our solutions;\n\u2022\ncompetition in the market for our products and services, as well as competition for referral sources;\n\u2022\nrapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions, and evolving industry standards, including with respect to how our products and services are marketed to consumers, in how consumers find, purchase and use our products and services and in technology intended to block email marketing;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating technologies, products and employees from companies we have acquired or may acquire in the future or in migrating acquired subscribers from an acquired company\u2019s platforms to our platform;\n\u2022\nsystems, data center and Internet failures and service interruptions;\n\u2022\nnetwork security breaches or sabotage resulting in the unauthorized use or disclosure of, or access to, personally identifiable information or other confidential information;\n\u2022\nloss of key employees;\n\u2022\nour ability to drive growth through mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, or strategic investments;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions negatively affecting the SMB sector and changes in growth rate of SMBs;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs arising from our international operations and continued international expansion;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in distributing new products;\n\u2022\nshortcomings or errors in, or misinterpretations of, our metrics and data which cause us to fail to anticipate or identify trends in our market;\n\u2022\nterminations of, disputes with, or material changes to our relationships with third-party partners, including referral sources, product partners, data center providers, payment processors and landlords;\n\u2022\na shift in subscriber demand to lower margin solutions, which could increase our cost of revenue;\n\u2022\ncosts or liabilities associated with any past or future acquisitions, strategic investments or joint ventures that we may make or enter into;\n\u2022\nchanges in legislation that affect our collection of sales and use taxes or changes to our business that subject us to taxation in additional jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of capital expenditures, such as investments in our hardware and software systems, as well as extraordinary expenses, such as litigation or other dispute-related settlement payments;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulation or to regulatory bodies, such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, that could affect our business and our industry, or costs of or our failure to comply with such regulation; and\n\u2022\nlitigation or governmental enforcement actions against us, including due to failures to comply with applicable law or regulation.\nIt is possible that in one or more future quarters, due to any of the factors listed above, a combination of those factors or other reasons, our operating results may be below our expectations and the expectations of research analysts and investors. In that event, our stock price could decline substantially.\nThe acquisition of Constant Contact may not achieve the intended benefits or may disrupt our current plans and operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our business with Constant Contact\u2019s business or realize the anticipated synergies from the acquisition in the anticipated amounts or within the anticipated timeframes or cost expectations or at all. The difficulties and risks associated with the integration of Constant Contact, which is likely to be complex and time-consuming, include:\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of Constant Contact customers, or difficulties or higher than anticipated costs in adding new Constant Contact customers, due to the actual or perceived impact of the acquisition and integration of Constant Contact customers;\n\u2022\npossible aggressive targeting of existing and potential Constant Contact customers by Constant Contact\u2019s competitors seeking to capitalize on potential customer concerns about the acquisition;\n\u2022\npossible differences in the standards, controls, procedures, policies, corporate culture and compensation structures of our company and Constant Contact, which may lead to unanticipated delays, costs or inefficiencies, employee departures or difficulties consolidating the operations of the companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and delays in implementing our integration plan, which may result in us failing to achieve the anticipated synergies from the acquisition in a timely manner or at all;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees and the costs associated with our efforts to retain key employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulties successfully managing relationships with our combined partner and vendor base;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we, as a successor owner, may be responsible for actual or contingent liabilities of Constant Contact that we failed to discover during our due diligence investigation prior to our agreement to acquire Constant Contact;\n\u2022\nobligations that we may have to counterparties of Constant Contact that arise as a result of the change in control of Constant Contact;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to utilize Constant Contact\u2019s net operating loss carry-forwards to offset payments of future federal and state income tax liabilities; and\n\u2022\nthe potential that we or Constant Contact may be adversely affected by other economic, political, legislative, regulatory, business, competitive or other factors affecting our industry.\nThus, the integration may be unpredictable, or subject to delays or changed circumstances, and we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Constant Contact acquisition, such as:\n\u2022\ncost and revenue synergies,\n\u2022\noperational efficiencies,\n\u2022\nthe ability to cross-sell our products into Constant Contact\u2019s customer base and vice versa, and\n\u2022\nthe ability to adapt Constant Contact\u2019s products to different segments of the SMB market through our multi-brand strategy.\nThe anticipated benefits and synergies we expect from the acquisition are based on various projections and assumptions, which may not materialize as or when expected or may prove to be inaccurate. A failure to realize the expected cost and revenue synergies or operational efficiencies related to the acquisition could result in higher costs and lower combined revenue, adjusted revenue, adjusted EBITDA, unlevered free cash flow or free cash flow than expected and have an adverse effect on our financial results and prospects. Any such effect on our financial results may mean that we are not able to meet our expectations for combined adjusted revenue, adjusted EBITDA, unlevered free cash flow, free cash flow or other financial or operational metrics.\nOur business may be negatively impacted following the Constant Contact acquisition if we are unable to effectively manage our expanded operations. The implementation of our integration plans following the acquisition will be costly, complex and time consuming and will require significant time and focus from management and may divert attention from the day-to-day operations of the combined business. Additionally, consummation of the Constant Contact acquisition could disrupt our plans and operations, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives.\nWe may not be able to continue to add new subscribers, retain existing subscribers or increase sales to existing subscribers, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur growth is dependent on our ability to continue to attract and acquire new subscribers while retaining existing subscribers and expanding the products and services we sell to them. Growth in the demand for our products and services may be inhibited, and we may be unable to sustain growth in our subscriber base, for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour failure to develop or offer new or additional products and services in a timely manner that keeps pace with new technologies and the evolving needs of our subscribers;\n\u2022\nour inability to market our solutions in a cost-effective manner to new subscribers or to our existing subscribers and to increase our sales to existing subscribers, including due to changes in regulation, or changes in the enforcement of existing regulation that would impair our marketing practices, require us to change our sign-up processes or require us to increase disclosure designed to provide greater transparency as to how we bill and deliver our services;\n\u2022\nour inability to acquire or retain new subscribers through mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic investments;\n\u2022\nour inability to offer solutions that are adequately integrated and customizable to meet the needs of our highly diverse and fragmented subscriber base;\n\u2022\nchanges in search engine ranking algorithms or in search terms used by potential subscribers, either of which may have the effect of increasing our competitors\u2019 search engine rankings or increasing our marketing costs to offset lower search engine rankings;\n\u2022\nchanges in, or a failure to manage, technology intended to block email marketing;\n\u2022\nfailure of our third-party development partners, which provide a significant portion of our offerings, to continue to support existing products and to develop and support new products;\n\u2022\nthe inability of our subscribers to differentiate our solutions from those of our competitors or our inability to effectively communicate such distinctions;\n\u2022\nour inability to maintain awareness of our brands;\n\u2022\nour inability to maintain a consistent user experience and timely and consistent product upgrade schedule for all of our subscribers due to the fact that not all of our brands, products, or services operate from the same control panel or other systems;\n\u2022\nour inability to penetrate, or adapt to requirements of, international markets, including our inability to obtain or maintain the required licenses to operate in certain international markets;\n\u2022\nour inability to enter into automatically renewing contracts with our subscribers or increase subscription prices;\n\u2022\nthe decisions by our subscribers to move the hosting of their Internet sites and web infrastructure to their own IT systems, into co-location facilities or to our competitors if we are unable to effectively market the scalability of our solutions;\n\u2022\nsubscriber dissatisfaction causing our existing subscribers to stop referring prospective subscribers to us; and\n\u2022\nperceived or actual security, integrity, reliability, quality or compatibility problems with our solutions, including related to unscheduled downtime, outages or network security breaches.\nA substantial amount of our revenue growth historically has been derived from increased sales of products and services to existing subscribers and from introductory subscriptions renewing at regular rates. Our costs associated with increasing revenue from existing subscribers are generally lower than costs associated with generating revenue from new subscribers. Therefore, a reduction in the rate of revenue increase from our existing subscribers, even if offset by an increase in revenue from new subscribers, could reduce our operating margins, and any failure by us to continue to attract and acquire new subscribers or increase our revenue from existing subscribers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe expect to leverage our current marketing strategy for Constant Contact\u2019s products and services, but our strategy may not be as successful for Constant Contact\u2019s products and services as we expect. In particular, Constant Contact\u2019s strong brand awareness may be diminished if we reduce or discontinue television and radio advertising in order to pursue the more targeted or success-based marketing methods we typically use for the rest of our business. If this occurs, we may not acquire new Constant Contact customers at the rate that we expect or we may need to incur higher than anticipated marketing expenses to acquire new Constant Contact customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe rate of growth of the SMB market for our solutions could be significantly lower than our estimates. If demand for our products and services does not meet expectations, our ability to generate revenue and meet our financial targets could be adversely affected.\nAlthough we expect continued demand in the SMB market for our cloud-based solutions and online marketing tools, it is possible that the rate of growth may not meet our expectations, or the market may not continue to grow at all, either of which would adversely affect our business. Our expectations for future revenue growth are based in part on assumptions reflecting our industry knowledge and experience serving SMBs, as well as our assumptions regarding demographic shifts, growth in the availability and capacity of Internet infrastructure internationally and macroeconomic conditions. If any of these assumptions proves to be inaccurate, then our actual revenue growth could be significantly lower than our expected revenue growth.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on our ability to offer an integrated and comprehensive suite of products and services that enable our diverse base of subscribers to establish, manage and grow their businesses. Our web presence and commerce offerings are predicated on the assumption that an online presence is, and will continue to be, an important factor in our subscribers\u2019 abilities to establish, expand, manage and monetize their businesses quickly, easily and affordably. If we are incorrect in this assumption, for example due to the introduction of a new technology or industry standard that supersedes the importance of an online presence or renders our existing or future solutions obsolete, then our ability to retain existing subscribers and attract new subscribers could be adversely affected, which could harm our ability to generate revenue and meet our financial targets.\nOur business and operations have experienced rapid growth and organizational change in recent years, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management and infrastructure, especially our billing systems and operational infrastructure. We have also made significant investments to support our growth strategy, which may not succeed. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service, produce accurate financial statements and other disclosures on a timely basis or address competitive challenges adequately.\nAs a result of acquisitions and internal growth, we increased our revenue from $520.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 to $629.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2014 to $741.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. The acquisition of Constant Contact, which generated approximately $367.4 million in revenue in the year ended December 31, 2015, represents a significant expansion in the size and scope of our business.\nOur growth has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, engineering, network operations and security, sales and support, marketing, legal, compliance, finance and other resources. In particular, our growth has placed, and will continue to place, a significant strain on our ability to maintain effective internal financial and accounting controls and procedures. For example, as a result of our acquisitions, we have acquired multiple billing systems that we are in the process of integrating, and we may acquire and integrate additional billing systems with future acquisitions. Any delays or other challenges associated with billing system build-outs or integrations could lead to inaccurate disclosure, which could prevent us from producing accurate financial statements on a timely basis and harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and our investors\u2019 view of us. In addition, we have identified in the past, and may in the future identify, errors in our systems, including the business intelligence system, which we use to generate certain operational and performance metrics. For example, in the third quarter of 2015, we identified errors in our business intelligence system that impacted three of our performance metrics, as described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our operational and performance metrics, which we voluntarily disclose, historically have not been subject to the same level of reporting controls as our financial statements and other financial information that we are required to disclose. We are working to improve our controls for these operational and performance metrics, but further errors with respect to these metrics could still occur. Errors of this type could result in inaccurate disclosures, negatively impact our business decisions and harm investors\u2019 view of us.\nIn addition, as a result of our growth, the increase in the number of our total subscribers has required us to invest in and improve the security, scale and flexibility of our infrastructure and information technology systems, and the increase in the number of payment transactions that we process for our subscribers has increased the amount of customer data that we store. Any loss of data or disruption in our ability to provide our product offerings due to disruptions to, or the inflexibility or lack of scale of, our infrastructure or information technology systems could harm our business or our reputation.\nWe have also made significant investments in our growth strategy, which may not succeed. For example, we have incurred significant expenses relating to our increased investments in product marketing and other marketing efforts to acquire new subscribers and to sell additional products to existing subscribers, and we intend\nto continue investing in our product marketing and other marketing efforts. We have also incurred significant expenses and allocated significant resources, including finance, operational, legal and compliance resources, related to the growth and continued expansion of our international operations, and we expect that such expenses and resource allocation will increase in the future. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe intend to further expand our overall business, subscriber base, data center infrastructure, headcount and operations, both domestically and internationally with no assurance that our business or revenue will continue to grow. Creating an organization with expanded U.S. and overseas operations and managing a geographically dispersed workforce will require substantial management effort, the allocation of significant management resources and significant additional investment in our infrastructure, including our information technology, operational, financial and administrative infrastructure and systems. We will also have to continue to ensure that our operational, financial, compliance, risk and management controls and our reporting procedures are in effect throughout our organization, and make improvements as necessary. As such, we may be unable to manage our expenses effectively in the future, which may adversely affect our gross margins or operating expenses in any particular quarter. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth and organizational change in a manner that preserves the key aspects of our corporate culture, the quality of our solutions may suffer or fail to keep up with changes in the industry or technological developments, which could adversely affect our brands and reputation and harm our ability to retain and attract subscribers.\nOur recent or potential future acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic investments could be difficult to execute and integrate, divert the attention of key personnel, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and impair our financial results. We may not be able to complete anticipated acquisitions and may not realize the expected benefits from our acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic investments that we have completed or may complete in the future.\nAcquisitions are an important component of our growth strategy. We have in the past acquired, and expect in the future to acquire, businesses and assets of other companies to increase our growth, enhance our ability to compete in our core markets or allow us to enter new markets. We also regularly make strategic investments in, and enter into joint ventures with, third parties. These strategic investment and joint venture arrangements are typically with small companies focused on developing products that we believe may serve as effective new gateways to acquire new subscribers or that may appeal to our existing subscriber base. Our ability to execute these acquisitions, strategic investments and joint venture transactions depends on a number of factors, including the availability of target companies at prices and on terms acceptable to us, our ability to obtain the necessary equity, debt or other financing, and regulatory constraints. Our inability to complete anticipated acquisitions, strategic investments or joint ventures for these or other reasons may negatively impact our ability to achieve our long-term growth targets.\nIn addition, these transactions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in integrating the technologies, products, operations, billing systems, personnel or operations of an acquired business and realizing the anticipated benefits of the combined businesses;\n\u2022\nreliance on third parties for transition services prior to subscriber migration or difficulties in supporting and migrating acquired subscribers, if any, to our platform, causing potential loss of such subscribers and damage to our reputation;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our ongoing business and diversion of financial, management, operations and customer support resources from existing operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in applying our controls and risk management and compliance policies and practices to acquired companies;\n\u2022\nintegration and support of redundant solutions or solutions that are outside of our core capabilities;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of additional debt in order to fund an acquisition, or assumption of debt or other liabilities, including litigation risk or risks associated with other unforeseen or undisclosed liabilities, of the acquired company, or exposure to successor liability for any legal violations of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nto the extent an acquired company has a corporate culture or compensation arrangement different from ours, difficulty assimilating or integrating the acquired organization and its talent, which could lead to morale issues, increased turnover and lower productivity than anticipated, and could also adversely affect the culture of our existing organization;\n\u2022\nthe price we pay, or other resources that we devote, may exceed the value we realize, or the value we could have realized if we had allocated the purchase price or other resources to another opportunity, or unanticipated costs associated with pursuing acquisitions;\n\u2022\npotential loss of an acquired business\u2019 strategic alliances and key employees, including those employees who depart prior to transferring to us, or without otherwise documenting, knowledge and information that are important to the efficient operation of the acquired business;\n\u2022\npotential deployment by an acquired company of its top talent to other of its business units prior to our acquisition if we do not acquire the entirety of an acquired company\u2019s stock or assets;\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with governance, management and control matters in majority or minority investments and risk of loss of all or a substantial portion of our investment;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our business due to sellers, former employees, contractors or third-party service providers of an acquired company or business misappropriating our intellectual property, violating non-competition agreements, or otherwise causing harm to our company;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences, including exposure of our entire business to taxation in additional jurisdictions, exposure to substantial penalties, fees and costs if an acquired company failed to comply, or is alleged by regulatory authorities to have failed to comply, with relevant tax rules and regulations prior to our acquisition, or substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges; and\n\u2022\naccounting effects, including potential impairment charges related to long-lived assets and requirements that we record deferred revenue at fair value.\nWe rely heavily on the representations and warranties provided to us by the sellers in our acquisitions, including as they relate to creation, ownership and rights in intellectual property, existence of open source software and compliance with laws and contractual requirements. If any of these representations and warranties are inaccurate or breached, we may incur liability for which there may not be adequate recourse against such sellers, in part due to contractual time limitations and limitations of liability, or we may need to pursue costly litigation against the sellers. Moreover, acquisitions frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets which are subject to potential impairments in the future that could harm our financial results. We may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions, or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies, which may adversely affect our profitability. In addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted.\nIf we fail to properly conduct due diligence efforts, evaluate acquisitions or investments or identify liabilities or challenges associated with the companies, businesses or technologies we acquire, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate. The failure to successfully evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments or otherwise adequately address these risks could materially harm our business and financial results.\nThe international nature of our business and our continued international expansion expose us to business risks that could limit the effectiveness of our growth strategy and cause our operating results to suffer.\nWe currently maintain offices and conduct operations primarily in the United States, Brazil, India, Israel and the United Kingdom and have third-party support arrangements in India, the Philippines and China. In addition,\nwe have localized versions of our Bluehost and HostGator sites targeted to customers in several countries, including Brazil, Russia, India, China, Turkey and Mexico. We intend to continue to expand our international operations, including through mergers and acquisitions.\nAny international expansion efforts that we undertake may not be successful. In addition, conducting operations in international markets or establishing international locations subjects us to new risks that we have not generally faced in the United States. These risks include:\n\u2022\nlocalization of the marketing and deployment of our solutions, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nlack of familiarity with, burdens of, and increased expense relating to, complying with foreign laws, legal standards, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers, some of which may favor local competitors, including laws related to employment or labor, laws regarding liability of online service providers for activities of subscribers, such as defamation, infringement or other illegal activities, and more stringent laws in foreign jurisdictions relating to the privacy and protection of personal data, as well as potential damage to our reputation as a result of our compliance or non-compliance with such requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in identifying and managing local staff, systems integrators, technology partners, and other third-party vendors and service providers;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources to explore, negotiate, or close acquisitions and to integrate, staff and manage geographically remote operations and employees;\n\u2022\nlonger than expected lead times for, or the failure of, an SMB market for our solutions to develop in the countries and regions in which we are opening offices and conducting operations;\n\u2022\nour inability to effectively market our solutions to SMBs due to our failure to adapt to local cultural norms, technology standards, billing and collection standards or pricing models;\n\u2022\ndiffering technology practices and needs that we are not able to meet, including an increased demand from our international subscribers that our cloud-based solutions be easily accessible and operational on smartphones and tablets;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting payments from subscribers or in automatically renewing their contracts with us, especially due to the more limited availability and popularity of credit cards in certain countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in attracting new subscribers, especially in developing countries and regions and those where the Internet infrastructure is still in its early stages;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in enforcing contracts, including our terms of service and other agreements;\n\u2022\nmanagement, communication and integration problems resulting from cultural or language differences and geographic dispersion;\n\u2022\nsufficiency of qualified labor pools and greater influence of organized labor in various international markets;\n\u2022\ncompetition from companies with international operations, including large international competitors and entrenched local companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in global currency systems or fluctuations in exchange rates that may increase the volatility of or adversely affect our foreign-based revenue;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, economic sanction laws and regulations, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, export controls including the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s Export Administration Regulations and other U.S., non-U.S. and local laws and regulations regarding international and multi-national business operations;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax (or sales, use or other tax) systems, our inadvertent failure to comply with all relevant foreign tax rules and regulations due to our lack of familiarity with the jurisdiction\u2019s tax laws, and restrictions and withholdings on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\nuncertain political and economic climates; and\n\u2022\nreduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries.\nThese factors have caused our international costs of doing business to exceed our comparable domestic costs and have caused the time and expense required to close our international acquisitions to exceed our comparable domestic costs. A negative impact from our international business efforts could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition as a whole.\nIn addition, our ability to expand internationally and attract and retain non-U.S. subscribers may be adversely affected by concerns about the extent to which U.S. governmental and law enforcement agencies may obtain data under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and Patriot Act and similar laws and regulations. Such non-U.S. subscribers may decide that the privacy risks of storing data with a U.S.-based company outweigh the benefits and opt to seek solutions from a company based outside of the United States. In addition, certain foreign governments are beginning to require local storage of their citizens\u2019 data. If we become subject to such requirements, it may require us to increase the number of non-U.S. data centers or servers we maintain, increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to attract, retain or cost-effectively serve non-U.S. subscribers.\nWe have experienced system, software, Internet, data center and customer support center failures and have not yet implemented a complete disaster recovery plan, and any interruptions, delays or failures in our services could harm our reputation, cause our subscribers to seek reimbursement for services paid for and not received, cause our subscribers to stop referring new subscribers to us, or cause our subscribers to seek to replace us as a provider of their cloud-based and online marketing solutions.\nWe must be able to operate our applications and systems without interruption. Since our ability to retain and attract subscribers depends on the performance, reliability and availability of our services, as well as in the delivery of our products and services to subscribers, even minor interruptions in our service or losses of data could harm our reputation. Our applications, network, systems, equipment, power supplies, customer support centers and data centers are subject to various points of failure, including:\n\u2022\nhuman error or accidents;\n\u2022\npower loss;\n\u2022\nequipment failure;\n\u2022\nInternet connectivity downtime;\n\u2022\nimproper building maintenance by the landlords of the buildings in which our co-located data centers are located;\n\u2022\nphysical or electronic security breaches (see also \u201c-Security and privacy breaches may harm our business\u201d);\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses;\n\u2022\nfire, hurricane, flood, earthquake, tornado and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\nwater damage;\n\u2022\nterrorism;\n\u2022\nintentional bad acts, such as sabotage and vandalism;\n\u2022\npandemics; and\n\u2022\nfailure by us or our vendors to provide adequate service to our equipment.\nWe have experienced system failures, delays and periodic interruptions in service, or outages, due to factors including power and network equipment failures; storage system failures; power outages; and network configuration failures. In addition, because our cloud-based platform is complex, we have experienced outages when new versions, enhancements and updates to applications, software or systems are released by us or third parties.\nWe will likely experience future outages that disrupt the operation of our solutions and harm our business due to factors such as these or other factors, including the accidental or intentional actions of Internet users, current and former employees and others; cooling equipment failures; other computer failures; or other factors not currently known to us or that we consider immaterial. While we have experienced increases in subscriber cancellations and decreases in our NPS following such outages in the past, we cannot be certain these outcomes are entirely attributable to the outages, and we do not believe that such outages have had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur systems are not fully redundant, and we have not yet implemented a complete disaster recovery plan or business continuity plan. Although the redundancies we do have in place will permit us to respond, at least to some degree, to failures of applications and systems, our data centers are vulnerable in the event of failure. Most of our subscribers are hosted across six U.S.-based data centers, one of which is owned by us and the rest of which are co-located. Our owned data center hosts approximately 40% of our subscribers (excluding Constant Contact customers). Accordingly, any failure or downtime in these data center facilities would affect a significant percentage of our subscribers. We do not yet have adequate structures or systems in place to recover from a data center\u2019s severe impairment or total destruction, and recovery from the total destruction or severe impairment of any of these data centers would be extremely difficult and may not be possible at all. Closing any of these data centers without adequate notice could result in lengthy, if not permanent, interruptions in the availability of our solutions and loss of vast amounts of subscriber data.\nOur data centers are also susceptible to impairment resulting from electrical power outages due to the amount of power and cooling they require to operate. Since we rely on third parties to provide our data centers with power sufficient to meet our needs, we cannot control whether our data centers will have an adequate amount of electrical resources necessary to meet our subscriber requirements. We attempt to limit exposure to system downtime due to power outages by using backup generators and power supplies. However, these protections may not limit our exposure to power shortages or outages entirely. We also rely on third parties to provide Internet connectivity to our data centers and any discontinuation or disruption to our connectivity could affect our ability to provide services to our subscribers.\nOur customer support centers are also vulnerable in the event of failure caused by total destruction or severe impairment. When calling our customer support services, most of our subscribers reach our customer support teams located in one of our six U.S.-based call centers. Our teams in each call center are trained to provide support services for a discrete subset of our brands, and they do not currently have complete capability to route calls from one call center to another call center. Accordingly, if any one of these call centers were to become non-operational due to severe impairment or total destruction, our ability to re-route calls to operational call centers or to provide customer support services to any subscribers of the brand or brands that the non-operational call center had formerly managed would be compromised. A significant portion of our email and chat-based customer support is provided by an India-based support team, which is employed by a third-party service provider. Although our email and chat-based customer support can be re-routed to our own centers, a disruption at our India customer support center could adversely affect our business.\nAny of these events could materially increase our expenses or reduce our revenue, damage our reputation, cause our subscribers to seek reimbursement for services paid for and not received, cause our subscribers to stop\nreferring new subscribers to us, and cause us to lose current and potential subscribers, which would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Moreover, the property and business interruption insurance we carry may not have coverage adequate to compensate us fully for losses that may occur.\nIf we are unable to maintain a high level of subscriber satisfaction, demand for our solutions could suffer.\nWe believe that our future revenue growth depends on our ability to provide subscribers with quality service that meets our stated commitments, meets or exceeds our subscribers\u2019 expectations and is conducive to our ability to continue to sell new solutions to existing subscribers. We are not always able to provide our subscribers with this level of service, and our subscribers occasionally encounter interruptions in service and other technical challenges, including as a result of outages or human error. If we are unable to provide subscribers with quality service, this may result in subscriber dissatisfaction, billing disputes and litigation, lower than expected renewal rates and impairments to our efforts to sell additional products and services to our subscribers, and we could face damage to our reputation, claims of loss, negative publicity or social media attention, decreased overall demand for our solutions and loss of revenue, any of which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, we may from time to time fail to meet the needs of specific subscribers in order to best meet the service expectations of our overall subscriber base. For example, we may suspend a subscriber\u2019s website when it breaches our terms of service, harms other subscribers\u2019 websites or disrupts servers supporting those websites, such as when a cyber criminal installs malware on a subscriber\u2019s website without that subscriber\u2019s authorization or knowledge. Although such service interruptions are not uncommon in a cloud-based or online environment, we risk subscriber dissatisfaction by interrupting one subscriber\u2019s service to prevent further attacks on or data breaches for other subscribers, and this could damage our reputation and have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe face significant competition for our solutions in the SMB market, which we expect will continue to intensify and which could require us to reduce our selling prices. As a result of such competitive pressures, we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position or market share.\nThe SMB market for cloud-based technologies and online marketing tools is highly competitive and constantly evolving. We expect competition to increase from existing competitors, who are also expanding the variety of solution-based services that they offer to SMBs, as well as potential new market entrants and competitors that may form strategic alliances with other competitors. Some of our competitors may have greater resources, more brand recognition and consumer awareness, more diversified product offerings, greater international scope and larger subscriber bases than we do. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully against them. If these companies decide to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services, if the products and services offered by these companies are more attractive to or better meet the evolving needs of SMBs, or if these companies respond more quickly to changing technologies, greater numbers of SMBs may choose to use these competitors for creating an online presence and as a general platform for running online business operations. There are also relatively few barriers to entry in this market, especially for providers of niche services, which often have low capital and operating expenses and the ability to quickly bring products to market that meet specific subscriber needs. Accordingly, as this market continues to develop, we expect the number of competitors to increase. The continued entry of competitors into the markets for cloud-based technologies and online marketing tools, and the rapid growth of some competitors that have already entered these markets, may make it difficult for us to maintain our market position.\nIn addition, in an attempt to gain market share, competitors may offer aggressive price discounts or alternative pricing models, such as so-called \u201cfreemium\u201d pricing in which a basic offering is provided for free with advanced features provided for a fee, on the services they offer, bundle several services at reduced prices, or increase commissions paid to their referral sources. These pricing pressures may require us to match these discounts and commissions in order to remain competitive, which would reduce our margins or cause us to fail to\nattract new subscribers that decide to purchase the discounted service offerings of our competitors. As a result of these factors, it is difficult to predict whether we will be able to maintain our average selling prices, pricing models and commissions paid to our referral sources. If we reduce our selling prices, alter our pricing models or increase commissions paid to our referral sources, it may become increasingly difficult for us to compete successfully, our profitability may be harmed and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe must keep up with rapid and ongoing technological change, marketing trends and shifts in consumer demand to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving industry.\nThe cloud-based technology and online marketing tool industries are characterized by rapid and ongoing technological change, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards. Our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, to adapt our solutions to evolving industry standards and consumer needs and to improve the performance and reliability of our applications and services. We must anticipate subscriber needs, commit significant resources to anticipating those needs and offer solutions that meet changing subscriber demands quickly and effectively. We may fail to accurately predict market demand or subscriber preferences, or subscribers may require features and functionality that our current applications and services do not have or that our platform is not able to support. If we fail to develop solutions that satisfy subscriber preferences in a timely and cost-effective manner, our ability to retain existing subscribers and attract new subscribers will be adversely affected, our competitive position will be impaired and we may not achieve our anticipated revenue growth. In order to develop new solutions or enhancements to existing solutions that satisfy subscriber preferences, we may be required to incur significant technology, development, marketing and other expenses, and our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the manner in which we market to our subscribers and potential subscribers must keep pace with technological change, marketing trends and shifts in how our solutions are found, purchased and used by subscribers and potential subscribers. For example, application marketplaces, mobile platforms and new search engines and search methods are changing the way in which consumers find, purchase and use our solutions. If we are not able to take advantage of such technologies or anticipate such trends, if existing technologies or systems, such as the domain name system which directs traffic on the Internet, become obsolete, or if we fail to anticipate and manage technologies that prevent or harm our offerings, such as technology intended to block email marketing, we may be unable to continue to attract new subscribers or sell additional solutions to our existing subscribers.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to continue to identify and partner with or acquire third parties who offer and are able to adapt to new technologies and to develop compelling and innovative solutions that can be integrated with our platform and brought to market. If we or our third-party partners are unable to adapt to rapidly changing technologies and develop solutions that meet subscriber requirements, our revenue and operating results may be adversely affected.\nIf the delivery of Constant Contact\u2019s customers\u2019 emails is limited or blocked or its customers\u2019 emails are directed to an alternate or \u201ctabbed\u201d section of the recipient\u2019s inbox, customers may cancel their accounts.\nInternet Service Providers, or ISPs, can block emails from reaching the intended recipients. While Constant Contact continually improves its technology and works closely with ISPs to maintain its deliverability rates, the implementation of new or more restrictive policies by ISPs may make it more difficult to deliver Constant Contact\u2019s customers\u2019 emails. In addition, some ISPs have started to categorize as \u201cpromotional\u201d emails that originate from email service providers and, as a result, direct them to an alternate or \u201ctabbed\u201d section of the recipient\u2019s inbox. If ISPs materially limit or halt the delivery of Constant Contact\u2019s customers\u2019 emails, or if Constant Contact fails to deliver its customers\u2019 emails in a manner compatible with ISPs\u2019 email handling or authentication technologies or other policies, or if the open rates of its customers\u2019 emails are negatively impacted by the actions of ISPs to categorize emails, then customers may question the effectiveness of Constant Contact\u2019s products and cancel their accounts. This, in turn, could harm our business and financial performance.\nSecurity and privacy breaches may harm our business.\nWe store and transmit large amounts of sensitive, confidential, personal and proprietary information, including payment card information. Any security breach, virus, accident, employee error, criminal activity or malfeasance, fraudulent service plan order, impersonation scam perpetrated against us, intentional misconduct by cyber criminals or similar intrusion, breach or disruption could result in unauthorized access to, usage or disclosure of, or loss of, confidential information, damage to our platform, and interruptions, delays or cessation of service to our subscribers, each of which may cause damage to our reputation and result in increased security costs, litigation, regulatory investigations or other liabilities. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of technology solutions and services that we offer and expand our operations in foreign countries.\nIn addition, many states and countries in which we have subscribers have enacted regulations requiring us to notify subscribers in the event that certain subscriber information is accessed, or believed to have been accessed, without authorization, and in some cases also develop proscriptive policies to protect against such unauthorized access. Such notifications can result in private causes of action being filed against us. Should we experience a loss of protected data, efforts to enhance controls, assure compliance and address penalties imposed by such regulatory regimes could increase our costs.\nOrganizations generally, and Internet-based organizations in particular, remain vulnerable to targeted attacks aimed at exploiting network and system applications or weaknesses. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, networks and systems often are not recognized until launched against a target. Cyber criminals are increasingly using powerful new tactics including evasive applications, proxies, tunneling, encryption techniques, vulnerability exploits, buffer overflows, distributed denial of service attacks, or DDoS attacks, botnets and port scans. For example, we and Constant Contact are frequently the targets of DDoS attacks in which attackers attempt to block subscribers\u2019 access to our websites. If we are unable to avert a DDoS or other attack for any significant period, we could sustain substantial revenue loss from lost sales and subscriber dissatisfaction. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Moreover, we may not be able to immediately detect that such an attack has been launched, if, for example, unauthorized access to our systems was obtained without our knowledge in preparation for an attack contemplated to commence in the future. Cyber attacks may target us, our subscribers, our partners, banks, credit card processors, delivery services, e-commerce in general or the communication infrastructure on which we depend.\nOur support agents are often targeted by, and may be vulnerable to, e-mail scams, phishing, social media or similar attacks, as well as social engineering tactics used to perpetrate fraud. We have experienced and may in the future experience security attacks that cause our support agents to divulge confidential information about us or our subscribers, or to introduce viruses, worms or other malicious software programs onto their computers, allowing the perpetrators to, among other things, gain access to our systems or our subscribers\u2019 accounts. Our subscribers may also use weak passwords, accidentally disclose their passwords or store them on a mobile device that is lost or stolen, or otherwise compromise the security of their data, creating the perception that our systems are not secure against third-party access. In addition, if third parties with which we work, such as vendors or developers, violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put our information and our subscribers\u2019 information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nIf an actual or perceived security breach occurs, the market\u2019s perception of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and current and potential subscribers. We might also be required to expend significant capital and resources to investigate, protect against or address these problems. Any significant violations of data privacy could result in the loss of business, litigation and regulatory investigations and penalties that could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, if a high profile security breach occurs with respect to another provider of cloud-based technologies or online marketing tools, our subscribers and potential subscribers may lose trust in the security of these\nbusiness models generally, which could harm our ability to retain existing subscribers or attract new ones. We cannot guarantee that our backup systems, regular data backups, security protocols, network protection mechanisms and other procedures currently in place, or that may be in place in the future, will be adequate to prevent network and service interruption, system failure, damage to one or more of our systems or data loss in the event of a security breach or attack on our network.\nThe success of Constant Contact\u2019s email marketing product depends on the continued growth and acceptance of email as a communications tool and the related expansion and reliability of the Internet infrastructure. If consumers do not continue to use email or alternative communications tools, such as social media or text messaging, gain popularity, demand for this email marketing product may decline.\nThe future success of Constant Contact\u2019s email marketing product depends on the continued and widespread adoption of email as a primary means of communication. Security problems such as \u201cviruses,\u201d \u201cworms\u201d and other malicious programs or reliability issues arising from outages and damage to the Internet infrastructure could create the perception that email is not a safe and reliable means of communication, which could discourage businesses and consumers from using email. Use of email by businesses and consumers also depends on the ability of ISPs to prevent unsolicited bulk email, or \u201cspam,\u201d from overwhelming consumers\u2019 inboxes. In recent years, ISPs have developed new technologies to filter unwanted messages before they reach users\u2019 inboxes. In response, spammers have employed more sophisticated techniques to reach consumers\u2019 inboxes. Although companies in the anti-spam industry have started to address the techniques used by spammers, if security problems become widespread or frequent or if ISPs cannot effectively control spam, the use of email as a means of communication may decline as consumers find alternative ways to communicate. In addition, if alternative communications tools, such as social media or text messaging, gain widespread acceptance, the need for email may lessen. Any decrease in the use of email would reduce demand for Constant Contact\u2019s email marketing product and harm our business.\nIf we do not maintain a low rate of credit card chargebacks and protect against breach of the credit card information we store, we will face the prospect of financial penalties and could lose our ability to accept credit card payments from subscribers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nA majority of our revenue is processed through credit card transactions. Under current credit card industry practices, we are liable for fraudulent and disputed credit card transactions because we do not obtain the cardholder\u2019s signature at the time of the transaction, even though the financial institution issuing the credit card may have authorized the transaction. Although we focus on keeping our rate of credit card refunds and chargebacks low, if our refunds or chargebacks increase, our credit card processors could require us to maintain or increase reserves, terminate their contracts with us or decline to serve as credit card processors for new joint ventures or brands, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe could also incur significant fines or lose our ability to give subscribers the option of using credit cards to fund their payments or pay their fees to us if we fail to follow payment card industry data security standards, even if there is no compromise of subscriber information. Although we believe we are in compliance with payment card industry data security standards and do not believe that there has been a compromise of subscriber information, we have not always been in full compliance with these standards. Accordingly, we could be fined, or our services could be suspended, for such failure to comply with payment card industry data security standards, which would cause us to not be able to process payments using credit cards. If we are unable to accept credit card payments, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nOur failure to limit fraudulent transactions conducted on our websites, such as through the use of stolen credit card numbers, could also subject us to liability or require us to increase reserves with our credit card processors. Under credit card association rules, penalties may be imposed at the discretion of the association. Any such potential penalties would be imposed on our credit card processor by the association. Under our\ncontract with our processor, we are required to reimburse our processor for such penalties. Our current level of fraud protection, based on our fraudulent and disputed credit card transaction history, is within the guidelines established by the credit card associations. However, we face the risk that we may fail to maintain an adequate level of fraud protection or that one or more credit card associations may, at any time, assess penalties against us or terminate our ability to accept credit card payments from subscribers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, we could be liable if there is a breach of the credit card or other payment information we store. Online commerce and communications depend on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. We rely on encryption and authentication technology that we have developed internally, as well as technology that we license from third parties, to provide security and authentication for the transmission of confidential information, including subscriber credit card numbers. However, we cannot ensure that this technology can prevent breaches of the systems that we use to protect subscriber credit card data. Although we maintain network security insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, some of our third-party partners also collect information from transactions with our customers, and we may be subject to litigation or our reputation may be harmed if our partners fail to protect our subscribers\u2019 information or if they use it in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices.\nData breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues. Under our contracts with our card processors, if there is unauthorized access to, or disclosure of, credit card information that we store, we could be liable to the credit card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses.\nOur growing operations in India, use of an India-based service provider and India-based workforce may expose us to risks that could have an adverse effect on our costs of operations and harm our business.\nWe currently use India-based third-party service providers to provide certain outsourced services to support our U.S.-based operations, including email- and chat-based customer and technical support, billing support, network monitoring and engineering and development services. As our operations grow, we expect to increase our use of these and other India-based outsourced service providers. Although there are cost advantages to operating in India, significant growth in the technology sector in India has increased competition to attract and retain skilled employees and has led to a commensurate increase in compensation costs. In the future, we or our third-party service providers may not be able to hire and retain such personnel at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure in India. In addition, we employ our own India-based workforce. Our use of a workforce in India exposes us to disruptions in the business, political and economic environment in that region. Our operations in India require us to comply with local laws and regulatory requirements, which are complex and burdensome and of which we may not always be aware, and expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our Indian operations may also subject us to trade restrictions, reduced or inadequate protection for intellectual property rights, security breaches and other factors that may adversely affect our business. Negative developments in any of these areas could increase our costs of operations or otherwise harm our business.\nWe have a history of losses and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have had a net loss in each year since inception. We had a net loss of $159.2 million for fiscal year 2013, a net loss of $42.8 million for fiscal year 2014 and a net loss of $25.8 million for fiscal year 2015 and we may incur losses in the future. In connection with our acquisitions, we have recorded long-lived assets at fair value. We record amortization expense in each reporting period related to the long-lived assets, which impacts the amount of net loss or income we record in each reporting period.\nWe do not know if we will be able to achieve and maintain profitability in the near future or at all. We have made and expect to continue to make significant expenditures to develop and expand our business. Our recent\ngrowth in revenue and number of subscribers may not be sustainable, and our revenue may be insufficient to maintain profitability. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including interest expense related to our substantial indebtedness, and the other risks described in this report, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown events.\nWe may need additional equity, debt or other financing in the future, which we may not be able to obtain on acceptable terms, or at all, and any additional financing may result in restrictions on our operations or substantial dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may need to raise funds in the future, for example, to develop new technologies, expand our business, respond to competitive pressures, acquire businesses, or respond to unanticipated situations. We may try to raise additional funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements. Although our credit agreement limits our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and our credit agreement may be amended with the consent of our lenders.\nOur ability to obtain debt or equity funding will depend on a number of factors, including market conditions, interest rates, our operating performance and investor interest. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to reduce expenditures, including curtailing our growth strategies, foregoing acquisitions or reducing our product development efforts. If we succeed in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities, then the issuance could result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, these new securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock. In addition, any preferred equity issuance or debt financing that we may obtain in the future could have restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Further, to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations, the risks associated with our substantial leverage described elsewhere in this report, including our possible inability to service our debt, would increase.\nOur business depends on establishing and maintaining strong brands. If we are not able to effectively promote our brands, or if the reputation of our brands is damaged, our ability to expand our subscriber base will be impaired and our business and operating results will be harmed.\nWe market our solutions through various brands, including Bluehost, HostGator, iPage, Domain.com, A Small Orange, MOJO Marketplace, BigRock, ResellerClub, and, with the acquisition of Constant Contact, Constant Contact and SinglePlatform, among others.\nWe believe that establishing and maintaining our brands is critical to our efforts to expand our subscriber base. If we do not continue to build awareness of our brands, we could be placed at a competitive disadvantage to companies whose brands are, or become, more recognizable than ours. To attract and retain subscribers and to promote and maintain our brands in response to competitive pressures, we may have to substantially increase our financial commitment to creating and maintaining distinct brand loyalty among subscribers or eliminate certain of our brands. If subscribers, as well as our third-party referral marketing, distribution and reseller partners, do not perceive our existing solutions to be reliable and of high quality, if we introduce new services or enter into new business ventures that are not favorably received by such parties, or if our brands become associated with any fraudulent or deceptive conduct on the part of our subscribers, the value of our brands could be diminished, thereby decreasing the attractiveness of our solutions to such parties. As a result, our operating results may be adversely affected by decreased brand recognition and harm to our reputation.\nOur success depends in part on our strategic relationships and joint ventures or other alliances with third parties on whom we rely to acquire subscribers and to offer solutions to our subscribers and from which we license intellectual property to develop our own solutions.\nIn order to expand our business, we plan to continue to rely on third-party relationships and alliances, such as with referrers and promoters of our brands and solutions, as well as with our providers of solutions and services that we offer to subscribers. Identifying, negotiating, documenting and managing relationships with third parties in certain cases requires significant time and resources, and it is possible that we may not be able to devote the time and resources we expect to such relationships. Integrating and customizing third parties\u2019 solutions with our platform also requires us to expend significant time and resources to ensure that each respective solution works with our platform, as well as with our other products and services. If any of the third parties on which we rely fails to perform as expected, breaches or terminates their agreement with us, or becomes engaged in a dispute with us, our reputation could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed.\nWe rely on third-party referral partners to acquire subscribers. If our third-party referral partners fail to promote our brands or to refer new subscribers to us, fail to comply with regulations, are forced to change their marketing efforts in response to new or existing regulations or cease to be viewed as credible sources of information by our potential subscribers, we may face decreased demand for our solutions and loss of revenue. Our third-party reseller partners purchase our solutions and resell them to their customer bases. These partners have the direct contractual relationships with our ultimate subscribers and, therefore, we risk the loss of both our third-party partners and their customers if our services fail to meet expectations or if our partners fail to perform their obligations or deliver the level of service to the ultimate subscriber that we expect.\nOur ability to offer domain name services to our subscribers depends on certain third-party relationships. For example, certain of our subsidiaries are accredited by ICANN and various other registries as a domain name registrar. If we fail to comply with domain name registry requirements or if domain name registry requirements change, we could lose our accreditation, be required to increase our expenditures, comply with additional requirements or alter our service offerings, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe also have relationships with product partners whose solutions, including site builders, shopping carts and security tools, we offer to our subscribers. A majority of our offerings are provided by third parties. We may be unable to continue our relationship with any of these partners if, for example, they decline to continue to work with us or are acquired by third parties. In such an event, we may not be able to continue to offer these third-party tools to our subscribers or we may be forced to find an alternative that may be inferior to the solution that we had previously offered, which could harm our business and our operating results.\nWe also rely on software licensed from or hosted by third parties to offer our solutions to our subscribers. In addition, we may need to obtain future licenses from third parties to use intellectual property associated with the development of our solutions, which might not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any software or other intellectual property required for the development and maintenance of our solutions could result in delays in the provision of our solutions until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated. Any errors or defects in third-party software could result in errors or a failure of our solutions which could harm our business and operating results. Further, we cannot be certain that the owners\u2019 rights in their technologies will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented.\nConstant Contact relies on some of its partners to create integrations with third-party applications and platforms used by Constant Contact\u2019s customers. If we fail to encourage these partners to create such integrations or if we do not adequately facilitate these integrations from a technology perspective, demand for Constant Contact products could decrease, which could harm our business and operating results.\nWe rely on a limited number of data centers to deliver most of our services. If we are unable to renew our data center agreements on favorable terms, or at all, our operating margins and profitability could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed. In addition, our recent purchase of our largest data center subjects us to potential costs and risks associated with real property ownership.\nWe currently serve most of our subscribers from six data center facilities located in Massachusetts (three), Texas, Utah and California. We own one of our data centers and occupy the remaining data centers pursuant to co-location service agreements with third-party data center facilities which have built and maintain the co-located data centers for us and other parties. Although we own the servers in these six data centers and engineer and architect the systems upon which our platform runs, we do not control the operation of the facilities we do not own.\nThe terms of our existing co-located data center agreements vary in length and expire over a period ranging from 2016 through 2018. The owners of these or our other co-located data centers have no obligation to continue such arrangements beyond their current terms, nor are they obligated to renew their agreements with us on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nOur existing co-located data center agreements may not provide us with adequate time to transfer operations to a new facility in the event of early termination or if we were unable to negotiate a short-term transition arrangement or renew these agreements on terms acceptable to us. If we were required to move our equipment to a new facility without adequate time to plan and prepare for such migration, we would face significant challenges due to the technical complexity, risk and high costs of the relocation. Any such migration would result in significant costs for us and significant downtime for large numbers of our subscribers. This could damage our reputation and cause us to lose current and potential subscribers, which would harm our operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are able to renew the agreements on our existing co-located data center facilities, we expect that the lease rates will be higher than those we pay under our existing agreements. If we fail to increase our revenue by amounts sufficient to offset any increases in lease rates for these facilities, our operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe currently intend to continue to contract with third-party data center operators, but we could be forced to re-evaluate those plans depending on the availability and cost of data center facilities, the ability to influence and control certain design aspects of the data center, and economic conditions affecting the data center operator\u2019s ability to add additional facilities.\nWith respect to the data center facility that we own, we are subject to risks, and may incur significant costs, related to our ownership of the facility and the land on which it is located, including costs or risks related to building repairs or upgrades and compliance with various federal, state and local laws applicable to real property owners, including environmental laws.\nIf our solutions and software contain serious errors or defects, then we may lose revenue and market acceptance and may incur costs to defend or settle claims.\nComplex technology platforms, software applications and systems such as ours often contain errors or defects, such as errors in computer code or other systems errors, particularly when first introduced or when new versions, enhancements or updates are released. Because we also rely on third parties to develop many of our solutions, our products and services may contain additional errors or defects as a result of the integration of the third party\u2019s product. Despite quality assurance measures, internal testing and beta testing by our subscribers, we cannot guarantee that our current and future solutions will not be free of serious defects, which could result in lost revenue or a delay in market acceptance.\nSince our subscribers use our solutions to maintain an online presence for their business, errors, defects or other performance problems could result in damage to our subscribers and their businesses. They could elect to cancel or not to renew their agreements, delay or withhold payments to us, or seek significant compensation from us for the losses they or their businesses suffer. Although our subscriber agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to certain claims, existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate or diminish these limitations. Even if not successful, a claim brought against us could be time-consuming and costly and could seriously damage our reputation in the marketplace, making it harder for us to acquire and retain subscribers.\nBecause we are required to recognize revenue for our subscription-based services over the term of the applicable subscriber agreement, changes in our sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results. In addition, we may not have adequate reserves in the event that our historical levels of refunds increase, which could adversely affect our liquidity and profitability.\nWe recognize revenue from our subscribers ratably over the respective terms of their agreements with us in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These contracts are generally for service periods of up to 36 months. Accordingly, increases in sales during a particular period do not translate into corresponding increases in revenue during that same period, and a substantial portion of the revenue that we recognize during a quarter is derived from deferred revenue from our agreements with subscribers that we entered into during previous quarters. As a result, we may not generate net earnings despite substantial sales activity during a particular period, since we are not allowed under applicable accounting rules to recognize all of the revenue from these sales immediately, and because we are required to record a significant portion of our related operating expenses during that period. Conversely, the existence of substantial deferred revenue may prevent deteriorating sales activity from becoming immediately apparent in our reported operating results.\nIn connection with our domain registration services, as a registrar, we are required under our agreements with domain registries to prepay the domain registry for the term for which a domain is registered. We recognize this prepayment as an asset on our consolidated balance sheet and record domain revenue and the domain registration expense ratably over the term that a domain is registered. This cash payment to the domain registry may lead to fluctuations in our liquidity that is not immediately reflected in our operating results.\nIn addition, our standard terms of service permit our subscribers to seek refunds from us in certain instances, and we maintain reserves to provide such refunds. The amount of such reserves is based on the amount of refunds that we have provided in the past. If our actual level of refund claims exceeds our estimates and our refund reserves are not adequate to cover such claims, our liquidity or profitability could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if we experience an unexpected decline in our revenue, we may not be able to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for such shortfall, and any significant shortfall in revenue relative to planned expenditures could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe depend on the experience and expertise of our senior management team, and the loss of any member of our senior management team could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur success and future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our senior management team, particularly Hari Ravichandran, our founder and chief executive officer. The members of our senior management team are not contractually obligated to remain employed by us. Accordingly, and in spite of our efforts to retain our senior management team with long-term equity incentives, any member of our senior management team could terminate his or her employment with us at any time and go to work for one of our competitors after the expiration of his or her non-compete period. The replacement of members of our senior management team likely would involve significant time and expense, and the loss of any member of our senior management team could significantly delay, prevent the achievement of or make it more difficult for us to\npursue and execute on our business objectives, and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur growth will be adversely affected if we cannot continue to successfully retain, hire, train and manage our key employees.\nOur ability to successfully pursue our growth strategy will depend on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees across our business. In particular, we are dependent on our platform and software engineers, those who manage our sales and service employees, and, as we grow internationally, those employees managing our operations outside of the United States. We face intense competition for these and other employees from numerous technology, software and manufacturing companies, and we cannot ensure that we will be able to attract, integrate or retain additional qualified employees in the future or at compensation levels consistent with our existing compensation and salary structure. In particular, candidates making employment decisions, particularly in high-technology industries, often consider the value of any equity they may receive in connection with their employment. As a result, any significant volatility in the market price of our common stock may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain highly skilled engineers and marketing personnel. In addition, we invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them.\nIf we are unable to attract new employees and retain our current employees, we may not be able to develop and maintain our services at the same levels as our competitors, and we may therefore lose subscribers and market share. Our failure to attract and retain qualified individuals could have an adverse effect on our ability to execute on our business objectives and, as a result, our ability to compete could decrease, our operating results could suffer and our revenue could decrease.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and information security, and we are subject to consumer protection laws that regulate our marketing practices and prohibit unfair or deceptive acts and practices. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business. Compliance with such laws could also impair our efforts to maintain and expand our subscriber base and provide certain of our product offerings, and thereby decrease our revenue.\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and various state and local governments and agencies regularly use their authority under laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive marketing and trade practices to investigate and penalize companies for practices related to the collection, use, handling, disclosure, and security of personal data of U.S. consumers. In addition, in connection with the marketing and advertisement of our products and services by us or our affiliates, we could be the target of claims relating to false or deceptive advertising or marketing practices, including under the auspices of the FTC and state consumer protection statutes.\nIn the European Union, or EU, and in other jurisdictions outside of the United States, we could be the target of similar claims under consumer protection laws, regulation of cloud services, ecommerce and distance selling regulation, advertising regulation, unfair competition rules or similar legislation. Online digital services may be subject to increased scrutiny in the near future given their rapid growth in recent years. For example, on December 1, 2015, the UK Competition and Markets Authority, or the CMA, announced that it is conducting a review of compliance with UK consumer protection laws in the cloud storage sector. As part of that effort, the CMA contacted a number of cloud storage companies, including our UK subsidiary, JDI Backup Ltd, or JDI, requesting information be provided on a voluntary basis. The CMA\u2019s review could result in enforcement action, requests for voluntary change in marketing and business practices and/or new guidance for the cloud storage industry, among others.\nIf we are found to have breached any consumer protection, ecommerce and distance selling, advertising, unfair competition laws or similar legislation in any country or any laws regulating cloud services, we may be\nsubject to enforcement actions that require us to change our business practices in a manner which may negatively impact revenue, as well as litigation, fines, penalties and adverse publicity that could cause our subscribers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business in a manner that harms our financial position. We also rely on third parties to provide marketing and advertising of our products and services, and we could be liable for, or face reputational harm as a result of, their marketing practices if, for example, they fail to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.\nWe collect personally identifiable information and other data from our subscribers and prospective subscribers. We use this information to provide services to our subscribers, to support, expand and improve our business and, subject to each subscriber\u2019s or prospective subscriber\u2019s right to decline or opt out, we may use this information to market other products and services to them. We may also share subscribers\u2019 personally identifiable information with certain third parties as authorized by the subscriber or as described in the applicable privacy policy.\nThe U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed guidelines or rules for the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information of individuals, and the FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use and dissemination of data. However, these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other requirements or our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws, policies, legal obligations or industry standards or any security incident that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other subscriber data may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties and/or adverse publicity and could cause our subscribers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nIn addition, several foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the countries of the EU and Canada, have laws and regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal data obtained from their residents, which are often more restrictive than those in the United States. Laws and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, disclosure and security of personal information that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, contact information, and, in some jurisdictions, certain unique identifiers.\nThe data privacy regime in the EU includes certain directives which, among other things, require EU member states to regulate the processing and movement of personal data, marketing and the use of cookies. Each EU member state has transposed the requirements of these directives into its own national data privacy regime, and therefore the laws differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nFuture laws or regulations, or modifications to existing laws or regulations, could impair our ability to collect and/or use user information that we use to provide targeted advertising to our users, thereby impairing our ability to maintain and grow our subscriber base and increase revenue. Future restrictions on the collection, use, sharing or disclosure of our subscribers\u2019 data or additional requirements for obtaining the consent of subscribers for the use and disclosure of such information could require us to modify our solutions and features, possibly in a material manner, and could limit our ability to develop new services and features.\nFor example, within the EU, legislators agreed upon the text of a new EU-wide General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, in December 2015 that is expected to come into effect in early 2018 and will replace the data protection laws of each EU member state. The GDPR will implement more stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements to erase an individual\u2019s information upon request, mandatory data breach notification requirements and higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. It also significantly increases penalties for non-compliance. If our privacy or data security measures fail to comply with applicable current or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations,\nenforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data or our marketing practices, fines or other liabilities, as well as negative publicity and a potential loss of business. Moreover, if future laws and regulations limit our subscribers\u2019 or prospective subscribers\u2019 ability to use and share personal data or our ability to store, process and share personal data, demand for our solutions could decrease, our costs could increase, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nIn recent years, U.S. and European lawmakers and regulators have expressed concern over the use of third-party cookies, web beacons and similar technology for online behavioral advertising. In the EU, informed consent is required for the placement of a cookie on a user\u2019s device. Any failure by us to comply with applicable requirements may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Regulation of cookies and web beacons may lead to broader restrictions on our research activities, including efforts to understand users\u2019 Internet usage. Such regulations may have a chilling effect on businesses, such as ours, that collect and use online usage information in order to attract and retain customers and may increase the cost of maintaining a business that collects or uses online usage information, increase regulatory scrutiny and increase the potential for civil liability under consumer protection laws. In response to marketplace concerns about the usage of third-party cookies and web beacons to track user behaviors, providers of major browsers have included features that allow users to limit the collection of certain data in general or from specified websites, and some regulatory authorities have been advocating the development of browsers that block cookies by default. These developments could impair our ability to collect user information that helps us provide more targeted advertising to our users. If such technology is widely adopted, it could adversely affect our business, given our use of cookies and similar technologies to target our marketing.\nFurthermore, the U.S. Controlling the Assault of Non Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, or CAN SPAM Act, establishes certain requirements for commercial email messages and specifies penalties for the transmission of commercial email messages that are intended to deceive the recipient as to source or content. The CAN SPAM Act, among other things, obligates the sender of commercial emails to provide recipients with the ability to opt out of receiving future emails from the sender. In addition, some states have passed laws regulating commercial email practices that are significantly more punitive and difficult to comply with than the CAN SPAM Act, particularly Utah and Michigan, which have enacted do-not-email registries listing minors who do not wish to receive unsolicited commercial email that markets certain covered content, such as adult or other harmful products. Some portions of these state laws may not be pre-empted by the CAN SPAM Act. The ability of our subscribers\u2019 customers to opt out of receiving commercial emails may minimize the effectiveness of our products, particularly Constant Contact\u2019s email marketing product. Moreover, non-compliance with the CAN SPAM Act carries significant financial penalties. If we were found to be in violation of the CAN SPAM Act, applicable state laws not pre-empted by the CAN SPAM Act, or similar foreign laws regulating the distribution of commercial email, whether as a result of violations by our subscribers or if we were deemed to be directly subject to and in violation of these requirements, we could be required to pay penalties, which would adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business, and our reputation would suffer. We also may be required to change one or more aspects of the way we operate our business, which could impair our ability to attract and retain subscribers or could increase our operating costs.\nWe rely on third parties to carry out a number of services for us, including processing personal data on our behalf, and while we enter into contractual arrangements to ensure that they only process such data according to our instructions and have sufficient security measures in place, any security breach or non-compliance with our contractual terms or breach of applicable law by such third parties could result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause our subscribers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation and business.\nNew laws, regulations or standards or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or standards, including those in the areas of data security, data privacy, consumer protection and regulation of ISPs, could require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations. In addition, there is a risk that we could be held subject to legislation in countries where we reasonably thought the laws did not apply to us. Failure by us\nto comply with applicable requirements may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nFailure to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nWe have devoted substantial resources to the development of our intellectual property, proprietary technologies and related processes. In order to protect our intellectual property, proprietary technologies and processes, we rely upon a combination of trademark, patent and trade secret law, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions. These afford only limited protection, may not prevent disclosure of confidential information, may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure, and may not now or in the future provide us with a competitive advantage. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties, including employees, subscribers and third parties, may make unauthorized or infringing use of our products, services, software and other functionality, in whole or in part, or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary.\nPolicing our proprietary rights and protecting our brands and domain names is difficult and costly and may not always be effective. In addition, we may need to enforce our rights under the laws of countries that do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States and any changes in, or unexpected interpretations of, the intellectual property laws in any country in which we operate may compromise our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our trademarks, products and proprietary information may increase.\nWe have registered, or applied to register, the trademarks associated with several of our leading brands in the United States and in certain other countries. Competitors may have adopted, and in the future may adopt, service or product names similar to ours, which could impede our ability to build our brands\u2019 identities and possibly lead to confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of the terms or designs of one of our trademarks.\nLitigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation or proceedings could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to our management, result in a diversion of resources, the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property, and have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. There can be no assurance that our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights on the Internet are uncertain and still evolving. Our failure to meaningfully establish and protect our intellectual property could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nWe could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement of another party\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States and abroad involving patents and other intellectual property rights. Companies providing Internet-based products and services are increasingly bringing and becoming subject to suits alleging infringement of proprietary rights, particularly patent rights, and to the extent we face increasing competition and become increasingly visible as a publicly-traded company, or if we become more successful, the possibility of intellectual property infringement claims may increase. In addition, our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may increase as a result of acquisitions that we make or our use of software licensed from or hosted by third parties, as we have less visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against\ninfringement risks. Third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired or licensed technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition or license.\nMany companies are devoting significant resources to obtaining patents that could affect many aspects of our business. Since we do not have a significant patent portfolio, this may prevent us from deterring patent infringement claims, and our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have.\nWe have filed several patent applications in the United States and foreign counterpart filings for some of those applications. Although some of these applications have issued to registration, we cannot assure you that patents will issue from every patent application, or that we will prosecute every application to registration, that patents that issue from our applications will give us the protection that we seek, or that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Any patents that may issue in the future from our pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection and may not be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers.\nThe risk of patent litigation has been amplified by the increase in certain third parties, so-called \u201cnon-practicing entities,\u201d whose sole business is to assert patent claims and against which our own intellectual property portfolio may provide little deterrent value. We could incur substantial costs in prosecuting or defending any intellectual property litigation and we have incurred such costs in the past. If we sue to enforce our rights or are sued by a third party that claims that our solutions infringe its rights, the litigation could be expensive and could divert our management\u2019s time and attention. Even a threat of litigation could result in substantial expense and time.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure. In addition, during the course of any such litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nAny intellectual property litigation to which we might become a party, or for which we are required to provide indemnification, may require us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\ncease selling or using solutions that incorporate the intellectual property that our solutions allegedly infringe;\n\u2022\nmake substantial payments for legal fees, settlement payments or other costs or damages;\n\u2022\nobtain a license or enter into a royalty agreement, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, to sell or use the relevant technology; or\n\u2022\nredesign the allegedly infringing solutions to avoid infringement, which could be costly, time-consuming or impossible.\nIf we are required to make substantial payments or undertake any of the other actions noted above as a result of any intellectual property infringement claims against us, our business or operating results could be harmed.\nIn addition, some of our agreements with partners and others require us to indemnify those parties for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us resulting from an adverse ruling on any such claim.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software could adversely affect our ability to sell our services and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe use open source software, such as MySQL and Apache, in providing a substantial portion of our solutions, and we may incorporate additional open source software in the future. Such open source software is\ngenerally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. If we fail to comply with these licenses, we may be subject to certain conditions, including requirements that we offer our solutions that incorporate the open source software for no cost; that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software; and/or that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. In addition, if a third-party software provider has incorporated open source software into software that we license from such provider, we could be required to disclose any of our source code that incorporates or is a modification of such licensed software. If an author or other third party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending such allegations and could be subject to significant damages, enjoined from the sale of our solutions that contained the open source software, and required to comply with the foregoing conditions, which could disrupt the distribution and sale of some of our solutions. In addition, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Such litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products.\nWe could face liability, or our reputation might be harmed, as a result of the activities of our subscribers, the content of their websites or the data they store on our servers.\nOur role as a provider of cloud-based solutions, including website hosting services and domain registration services, may subject us to potential liability for the activities of our subscribers on or in connection with their websites or domain names or for the data they store on our servers. Although our subscriber terms of use prohibit illegal use of our services by our subscribers and permit us to take down websites or take other appropriate actions for illegal use, subscribers may nonetheless engage in prohibited activities or upload or store content with us in violation of applicable law or the subscriber\u2019s own policies, which could subject us to liability.\nSeveral U.S. federal statutes may apply to us with respect to various subscriber activities:\n\u2022\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, or DMCA, provides recourse for owners of copyrighted material who believe that their rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed on the Internet. Under the DMCA, based on our current business activity as an online service provider that does not monitor, own or control website content posted by our subscribers, we generally are not liable for infringing content posted by our subscribers or other third parties, provided that we follow the procedures for handling copyright infringement claims set forth in the DMCA. Generally, if we receive a proper notice from, or on behalf of, a copyright owner alleging infringement of copyrighted material located on websites we host, and we fail to expeditiously remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material or otherwise fail to meet the requirements of the safe harbor provided by the DMCA, the copyright owner may seek to impose liability on us. Technical mistakes in complying with the detailed DMCA take-down procedures could subject us to liability for copyright infringement.\n\u2022\nThe Communications Decency Act of 1996, or CDA, generally protects interactive computer service providers such as us, from liability for certain online activities of their customers, such as the publication of defamatory or other objectionable content. As an interactive computer services provider, we do not monitor hosted websites or prescreen the content placed by our subscribers on their sites. Accordingly, under the CDA, we are generally not responsible for the subscriber-created content hosted on our servers. However, the CDA does not apply in foreign jurisdictions and we may nonetheless be brought into disputes between our subscribers and third parties which would require us to devote management time and resources to resolve such matters and any publicity from such matters could also have an adverse effect on our reputation and therefore our business.\n\u2022\nIn addition to the CDA, the Securing the Protection of our Enduring and Established Constitutional Heritage Act, or the SPEECH Act, provides a statutory exception to the enforcement by a U.S. court of\na foreign judgment that is less protective of free speech than the United States. Generally, the exception applies if the law applied in the foreign court did not provide at least as much protection for freedom of speech and press as would be provided by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution or by the constitution and law of the state in which the U.S. court is located, or if no finding of a violation would be supported under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution or under the constitution and law of the state in which the U.S. court is located. Although the SPEECH Act may protect us from the enforcement of foreign judgments in the United States, it does not affect the enforceability of the judgment in the foreign country that issued the judgment. Given our international presence, we may therefore, nonetheless, have to defend against or comply with any foreign judgments made against us, which could take up substantial management time and resources and damage our reputation.\nAlthough these statutes and case law in the United States have generally shielded us from liability for subscriber activities to date, court rulings in pending or future litigation, or future legislative or regulatory actions, may narrow the scope of protection afforded us under these laws. Several court decisions arguably have already narrowed the scope of the immunity provided to interactive computer services in the U.S. under the CDA. In addition, laws governing these activities are unsettled in many international jurisdictions, or may prove difficult or impossible for us to comply with in some international jurisdictions. Also, notwithstanding the exculpatory language of these bodies of law, we may be embroiled in complaints and lawsuits which, even if ultimately resolved in our favor, add cost to our doing business and may divert management\u2019s time and attention. Finally, other existing bodies of law, including the criminal laws of various states, may be deemed to apply or new statutes or regulations may be adopted in the future, any of which could expose us to further liability and increase our costs of doing business.\nConstant Contact\u2019s subscribers could also use Constant Contact\u2019s products or website to transmit negative messages or website links to harmful applications, reproduce and distribute copyrighted material or the trademarks of others without permission, or report inaccurate or fraudulent data or information. Any such use of Constant Contact\u2019s products could damage our reputation and we could face claims for damages, copyright or trademark infringement, defamation, negligence or fraud. Moreover, Constant Contact\u2019s customers\u2019 promotion of their products and services through Constant Contact\u2019s products may not comply with federal, state and foreign laws. We cannot predict whether Constant Contact\u2019s role in facilitating these activities would expose us to liability under these laws. Even if claims asserted against Constant Contact do not result in liability, we may incur substantial costs in investigating and defending such claims. If Constant Contact is found liable for its customers\u2019 activities, we could be required to pay fines or penalties, redesign business methods or otherwise expend resources to remedy any damages caused by such actions and to avoid future liability.\nWe may face liability for, or become involved in, disputes in connection with ownership or control of subscriber accounts, websites or domain names or in connection with domain names we own.\nAs a provider of cloud-based solutions, including as a registrar of domain names and related services, we from time to time become aware of disputes over ownership or control of subscriber accounts, websites or domain names. For example, disputes may arise as a result of a subscriber engaging a webmaster or other third party to help set up a web hosting account, register or renew a domain name, build a website, upload content, or set up email or other services.\nWe could face potential claims of tort law liability for our failure to renew a subscriber\u2019s domain, and we have faced such liability in the past. We could also face potential tort law liability for our role in the wrongful transfer of control or ownership of accounts, websites or domain names. The safeguards and procedures we have adopted may not be successful in insulating us against liability from such claims in the future. In addition, we face potential liability for other forms of account, website or domain name \u201chijacking,\u201d including misappropriation by third parties of subscriber accounts, websites or domain names and attempts by third parties to operate accounts, websites or domain names or to extort the subscriber whose accounts, websites or domain names were misappropriated. Furthermore, our risk of incurring liability for a security breach on or in connection\nwith a subscriber account, website or domain name would increase if the security breach were to occur following our sale to a subscriber of an SSL certificate that proved ineffectual in preventing it. Finally, we are exposed to potential liability as a result of our domain privacy service, wherein the identity and contact details for the domain name registrant are masked. Although our terms of service reserve the right to provide the underlying WHOIS information and/or to cancel privacy services on domain names giving rise to domain name disputes, including when we receive reasonable evidence of an actionable harm, the safeguards we have in place may not be sufficient to avoid liability, which could increase our costs of doing business.\nOccasionally a subscriber may register a domain name that is identical or similar to another party\u2019s trademark or the name of a living person. Disputes involving registration or control of domain names are often resolved through the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy, or UDRP, ICANN\u2019s administrative process for domain name dispute resolution, or through litigation under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, or ACPA, or under general theories of trademark infringement or dilution. The UDRP generally does not impose liability on registrars, and the ACPA provides that registrars may not be held liable for registering or maintaining a domain name absent a showing of bad faith, intent to profit or reckless disregard of a court order by the registrar. However, we may face liability if we fail to comply in a timely manner with procedural requirements under these rules. In addition, these processes typically require at least limited involvement by us and, therefore, increase our costs of doing business. Moreover, as the owner of domain name portfolios containing domains that we are providing for resale, we may face liability if one or more domain names in our portfolios is alleged to violate another party\u2019s trademark. While we screen the domains we acquire to mitigate the risk of third-party claims of trademark infringement, we may nonetheless inadvertently register or acquire domains that infringe or allegedly infringe third-party rights. Moreover, advertisements displayed on websites associated with domains registered by us may contain allegedly infringing content placed by third parties. As a result, our involvement in domain name disputes may increase in the future.\nWe are subject to export controls and economic sanctions laws that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.\nOur business activities are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export controls and trade and economic sanctions laws, including the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations maintained by OFAC. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, government investigations, and reputational harm. In addition, if our third-party resellers fail to comply with these laws and regulations in their dealings, we could face potential liability or penalties for violations. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions laws prohibit certain transactions with U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities.\nAlthough we take precautions and have implemented, and continue to seek to enhance, compliance measures to prevent transactions with U.S. sanction targets, from time to time we have identified, and we expect to continue to identify, instances of non-compliance with these laws, rules and regulations and transactions which we are required to block and report to OFAC. In addition, as a result of our acquisition activities, we have acquired, and it is likely that we will continue to acquire, companies for which we could face potential liability or penalties for violations if they have not implemented sufficient compliance measures to prevent transactions with U.S. sanction targets. Until we are able to fully integrate our compliance processes into the operations of such acquired companies, we are at an increased risk of transacting business with U.S. sanction targets. Our failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations could result in negative consequences to us, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm.\nChanges in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction and sale of our solutions in international markets, prevent our subscribers with international operations from deploying our solutions or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such\nregulations, could result in decreased use of our solutions or decreased ability to export or sell our solutions to existing or potential subscribers with international operations. Any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nDue to the global nature of our business, we could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery laws.\nThe global nature of our business requires us to comply with laws and regulations that prohibit bribery and corruption anywhere in the world. The FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or the Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions where we do business generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or an improper business advantage. In addition, the FCPA requires public companies to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. We currently operate, and plan to expand our operations, in areas of the world that have a reputation for heightened risks of corruption and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We operate in several countries and sell our products to subscribers around the world, which requires our employees and business partners acting on our behalf to comply with all laws, including anti-corruption laws. In addition, changes in laws could result in increased regulatory requirements and compliance costs which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure that our employees, business partners or other agents will not engage in prohibited conduct and expose us to the risk of liability under the FCPA, the Bribery Act, or other anti-bribery laws. If we are found to be in violation of the FCPA, the Bribery Act or other anti-bribery laws, we could suffer criminal and civil penalties, other sanctions, and reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAdverse economic conditions in the United States and international economies could harm our operating results.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions, such as a recession or economic slowdown in the United States or in one or more of our other major markets, could adversely affect the affordability of, and demand for, our solutions. The national and global economic downturn in recent years affected many sectors of the economy and resulted in, among other things, declines in overall economic growth, consumer and corporate confidence and spending; increases in unemployment rates; and uncertainty about economic stability. Changing macroeconomic conditions may affect our business in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. In particular, SMB spending patterns are difficult to predict and are sensitive to the general economic climate, the economic outlook specific to the SMB industry, the SMB\u2019s level of profitability and debt and overall consumer confidence. Our solutions may be considered discretionary by many of our current and potential subscribers and may be dependent upon levels of consumer spending. As a result, resellers and consumers considering whether to purchase our solutions may be influenced by macroeconomic factors that affect SMB and consumer spending.\nTo the extent conditions in the economy deteriorate, our business could be harmed as subscribers may reduce or postpone spending and choose to discontinue our solutions, decrease their service level, delay subscribing for our solutions or stop purchasing our solutions all together. In addition, our efforts to attract new subscribers may be adversely affected. Weakening economic conditions may also adversely affect third parties with which we have entered into relationships and upon which we depend in order to grow our business, which could detract from the quality or timeliness of the products or services such parties provide to us and could adversely affect our reputation and relationships with our subscribers.\nIn uncertain and adverse economic conditions, decreased consumer spending is likely to result in a variety of negative effects such as reduction in revenue, increased costs, lower gross margin percentages and recognition of impairments of assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. Uncertainty and adverse economic\nconditions may also lead to a decreased ability to collect payment for our solutions and services due primarily to a decline in the ability of our subscribers to use or access credit, including through credit cards and PayPal, which is how most of our subscribers pay for our services. We also expect to continue to experience volatility in foreign exchange rates, which could adversely affect the amount of expenses we incur and the revenue we record in future periods. If any of the above risks are realized, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nImpairment of goodwill and other intangible assets would result in a decrease in earnings.\nCurrent accounting rules provide that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives may not be amortized, but instead must be tested for impairment at least annually. These rules also require that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We have substantial goodwill and other intangible assets, and we would be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined. Any impairment charges or changes to the estimated amortization periods could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Substantial Indebtedness\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe now have, and expect to continue to have, significant indebtedness that could result in a material and adverse effect on our business. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $1,093.4 million of aggregate indebtedness. As of February 9, 2016, after giving effect to the acquisition of Constant Contact, we had approximately $2,082.6 million of aggregate indebtedness, net of original issue discount. Under our first lien term loan facility and our incremental first lien term loan facility entered into in connection with the acquisition of Constant Contact, we are required to repay approximately $2.6 million and $3.7 million, respectively, of principal at the end of each quarter and accrued interest upon the maturity of each interest accrual period, which totaled $52.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and we currently estimate will be $15.8 million and $11.1 million, respectively, per fiscal quarter for 2016. The interest accrual periods under our Senior Credit Facilities are typically three months in duration. The actual amounts of our debt servicing payments vary based on the amounts of indebtedness outstanding, whether we borrow on a LIBOR or base rate basis, the applicable interest accrual periods and the applicable interest rates, which vary based on prescribed formulas.\nWe may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future. The terms of the Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Notes permit us to incur additional debt subject to certain conditions. This high level of debt could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse financial, business, economic and industry conditions, as well as other factors that are beyond our control;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate and placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less highly leveraged;\n\u2022\nrestricting our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are, and may in the future be, at variable interest rates;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to sell assets or incur additional indebtedness if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our liquidity needs;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at or before maturity; and\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to fund other liquidity needs.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events or our failure to generate sufficient cash flow from operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nThe terms of our Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture governing our outstanding Notes impose restrictions on our business, reducing our operational flexibility and creating default risks. Failure to comply with these restrictions, or other events, could result in default under the relevant agreements that could trigger an acceleration of our indebtedness that we may not be able to repay.\nOur Senior Credit Facilities and the Notes require compliance with a set of financial and non-financial covenants. These covenants contain numerous restrictions on our ability to among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments (including any dividends or other distributions in respect of our capital stock and any investments);\n\u2022\nsell or transfer assets;\n\u2022\nenter into affiliate transactions;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\ntake other actions.\nAs a result, we may be restricted from engaging in business activities that may otherwise improve our business or from financing future operations or capital needs. Failure to comply with the covenants, if not cured or waived, could result in an event of default that could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness, which would require us to repay all amounts owing under the Senior Credit Facilities and the Notes and could have a material adverse impact on our business. Our Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Notes also contain provisions that trigger repayment obligations, including in some cases upon a change of control, as well as various representations and warranties which, if breached, could lead to events of default. We cannot be certain that our future operating results will be sufficient to ensure compliance with the covenants in our Senior Credit Facilities or the indenture governing the Notes or to remedy any defaults under our Senior Credit Facilities or the Notes. In addition, in the event of any event of default and related acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make any accelerated payments.\nEIG Investors, the borrower under our Senior Credit Facilities and the Issuer of the Notes, is a holding company, and may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness.\nEIG Investors Corp, or EIG Investors, the borrower under our Senior Credit Facilities and the issuer of the Notes, has no direct operations and no significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Because it conducts its operations through its operating subsidiaries, EIG Investors depends on those entities to generate the funds necessary to meet its financial obligations, including its required obligations under our Senior Credit Facilities and the Notes. The ability of our subsidiaries to make transfers and other distributions to EIG Investors\nwill be subject to, among other things, the terms of any debt instruments of those subsidiaries then in effect, applicable law, prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If transfers or other distributions from our subsidiaries to EIG Investors were eliminated, delayed, reduced or otherwise impaired, its ability to make payments on its obligations would be substantially impaired.\nFurthermore, if EIG Investors\u2019 cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund its debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, seek additional capital, restructure or refinance EIG Investors\u2019 or our indebtedness, or sell assets. We may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, which would limit EIG Investors\u2019 ability to meet its scheduled debt service obligations (including in respect of the Senior Credit Facilities or the Notes). Our ability to restructure or refinance debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and the financial condition of EIG Investors and us at the time. Any refinancing of EIG Investors\u2019 debt could be at higher interest rates and may require EIG Investors to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Notes offered hereby will restrict our ability to use the proceeds from asset sales. We may not be able to consummate those asset sales to raise capital or sell assets at prices that we believe are fair, and any proceeds that we receive may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on EIG Investors\u2019 outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of its credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness.\nEIG Investors may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer, which would cause a default under the indenture governing the Notes and the Senior Credit Facilities.\nUpon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events, EIG Investors will be required under the indenture governing the Notes to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, unless the Notes have been previously called for redemption. The source of funds for any such purchase of the Notes will be EIG Investors\u2019 available cash or cash generated from its subsidiaries\u2019 operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. EIG Investors may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control because it may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the Notes that are tendered upon a change of control. Further, EIG Investors may be contractually restricted under the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities from repurchasing all of the Notes tendered by holders upon a change of control. Accordingly, EIG Investors may not be able to satisfy its obligations to purchase the Notes unless it is able to refinance or obtain waivers under the Senior Credit Facilities. EIG Investors\u2019 failure to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control would cause a default under the indenture governing the Notes and a cross default under the Senior Credit Facilities. The Senior Credit Facilities also provide that a change of control is a default that permits lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Any of EIG Investors\u2019 future debt agreements may contain similar provisions.\nIn addition, in certain circumstances specified in the indenture governing the Notes, EIG Investors will be required to commence an asset sale offer, as defined under the indenture governing the Notes, pursuant to which it will be obligated to offer to purchase the applicable Notes at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. EIG Investors\u2019 other debt may contain restrictions that would limit or prohibit EIG Investors from completing any such asset sale offer. EIG Investors\u2019 failure to purchase any such Notes when required under the indenture would be an event of default.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and may in the future be volatile, which could cause holders of our common stock to incur substantial losses.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may in the future be subject to substantial price volatility. As a result of this volatility, our stockholders could incur substantial losses. The market price of our\ncommon stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the factors listed below and other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section:\n\u2022\nlow trading volume, which could cause even a small number of purchases or sales of our stock to have an impact on the trading price of our common stock;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of comparable companies;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our earnings or any financial projections we may provide to the public, or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of securities analysts;\n\u2022\nratings changes by debt ratings agencies;\n\u2022\nshort sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving our capital stock;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new products, strategic alliances, or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nlitigation or regulatory proceedings involving us;\n\u2022\ninvestors\u2019 general perception of us;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic, industry and market conditions and trends; and\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. In May 2015, a class action securities lawsuit was filed against us, and in the future we may be the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish, or cease publishing, research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts or other parties may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. We do not have any control over these parties. If one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our stock, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nA substantial portion of our issued and outstanding common stock can be traded without restriction at any time, and the remaining shares of our issued and outstanding common stock can be sold subject to volume limitations and other requirements applicable to affiliate sales under the federal securities laws. As such, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, we have registered 18,000,000 shares of common stock that have been issued or reserved for future issuance under our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan, which we refer to as our 2013 Plan. Of these shares, as of December 31, 2015, a total of 12,754,559 shares of our common stock are subject to outstanding options, restricted stock units and restricted stock awards, of which 3,502,499 shares are exercisable or have vested. The exercise of these options or the vesting of restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock and the subsequent sale of the common stock underlying such options or upon the vesting of such restricted stock\nunits and restricted stock awards could cause a decline in our stock price. These sales also might make it difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that any future issuances may have on the market price for our common stock.\nIn addition, holders of an aggregate of 71,896,177 shares of our common stock have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. Once we register these shares, they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to any applicable vesting requirements.\nInsiders have substantial control over us, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our directors, executive officers and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, 56.7% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Specifically, investment funds and entities affiliated with Warburg Pincus own, in the aggregate, 34.9% of our issued and outstanding common stock, and investment funds and entities affiliated with Goldman Sachs own, in the aggregate, approximately 11.2% of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if they act together, could have significant influence over the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. Our stockholders agreement contains agreements among the parties with respect to certain matters, including the election of directors, and certain restrictions on our ability to effect specified corporate transactions. If these stockholders were to act together, they could have significant influence over the management and affairs of our company. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company and might affect the market price of our common stock. In particular, the significant ownership interest of investment funds and entities affiliated with Warburg Pincus and Goldman Sachs in our common stock could adversely affect investors\u2019 perceptions of our corporate governance practices.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and our stockholders agreement, as well as provisions of Delaware law, might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, our stockholders agreement and Delaware law contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued without stockholder approval and with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings; provided that for so long as investment funds and entities affiliated with Warburg Pincus or Goldman Sachs, collectively, own a majority of our issued and outstanding capital stock, special meetings of our stockholders may be called by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our issued and outstanding voting stock;\n\u2022\nproviding that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be taken at a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and may not be taken by any consent in writing by such stockholders; provided that for so long as investment funds and entities affiliated with either Warburg Pincus or Goldman Sachs, collectively, own a majority of our issued and outstanding capital stock, a meeting and vote of stockholders may be dispensed with, and the action may be taken without\nprior notice and without such meeting and vote if a written consent is signed by the holders of issued and outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at the meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors; provided that no advance notice shall be required for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors pursuant to our stockholders agreement;\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board of directors and stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nproviding our board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings;\n\u2022\nestablishing a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nestablishing Delaware as the exclusive jurisdiction for specified types of stockholder litigation involving us or our directors;\n\u2022\nproviding that for so long as investment funds and entities affiliated with Warburg Pincus have the right to designate at least three directors for election to our board of directors, certain actions required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders, including amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws and certain specified corporate transactions, may be effected only with the affirmative vote of 75% of our board of directors, in addition to any other vote required by applicable law;\n\u2022\nproviding that for so long as investment funds and entities affiliated with Warburg Pincus have the right to designate at least one director for election to our board of directors and for so long as investment funds and entities affiliated with Goldman Sachs have the right to designate one director for election to our board of directors, in each case, a quorum of our board of directors will not exist without at least one director designee of each of Warburg Pincus and Goldman Sachs present at such meeting; provided that if a meeting of our board of directors fails to achieve a quorum due to the absence of a director designee of Warburg Pincus or Goldman Sachs, as applicable, the presence of a director designee of Warburg Pincus or Goldman Sachs, as applicable, will not be required in order for a quorum to exist at the next meeting of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nlimiting the determination of the number of directors on our board of directors and the filling of vacancies or newly created seats on the board to our board of directors then in office; provided that for so long as investment funds and entities affiliated with either Warburg Pincus or Goldman Sachs have the right to designate at least one director for election to our board of directors, any vacancies will be filled in accordance with the designation provisions set forth in our stockholders agreement; and\n\u2022\nproviding that directors may be removed by stockholders only for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast in an annual election of directors; provided that any director designated by investment funds and entities affiliated with either Warburg Pincus or Goldman Sachs may be removed with or without cause only by Warburg Pincus or Goldman Sachs, respectively, and for so long as investment funds and entities affiliated with either Warburg Pincus or Goldman Sachs, collectively, hold at least a majority of our issued and outstanding capital stock, our directors, other than a director designated by investment funds and entities affiliated with either Warburg Pincus or Goldman Sachs, respectively, may be removed with or without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our issued and outstanding capital stock.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our issued and\noutstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our issued and outstanding common stock. Since the investment funds and entities affiliated with Warburg Pincus and Goldman Sachs became holders of more than 15% of our issued and outstanding common stock in a transaction that was approved by our board of directors, the restrictions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law would not apply to a business combination transaction with any investment funds or entities affiliated with either Warburg Pincus or Goldman Sachs. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation expressly exempts investment funds and entities affiliated with either Warburg Pincus or Goldman Sachs from the applicability of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Any provision of our restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices. We also need to ensure that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis. Failure to maintain proper and effective internal controls could impair our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business, and our investors\u2019 view of us.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Global Select Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to comply with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time-consuming and costly. These rules and regulations have made it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, which could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors.\nOne aspect of complying with these rules and regulations as a public company is that we are required to ensure that we have adequate financial and accounting controls and procedures in place. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated periodically.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, requires that we evaluate, test and document our internal controls and, as a part of that evaluation, documentation and testing, identify areas for further attention and improvement. In order to comply with Section 404, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, and potentially recruit additional finance and accounting personnel or engage outside consultants, to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement and maintain a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Implementing and maintaining any appropriate changes to our internal controls may distract our officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify our existing processes and take significant time to complete. These changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls.\nThus, despite our efforts, there is a risk that in the future we will not be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. Any failure to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, or identification and failure to remediate one or more material weaknesses could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and make it more difficult for us to market and sell our solutions to new and existing subscribers.\nCertain of our stockholders have the right to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us.\nInvestment funds and entities affiliated with either Warburg Pincus or Goldman Sachs, together, hold a controlling interest in our company. Warburg Pincus, Goldman Sachs and their respective affiliates have other investments and business activities in addition to their ownership of our company. Warburg Pincus, Goldman Sachs and their respective affiliates have the right, and have no duty to abstain from exercising the right, to engage or invest in the same or similar businesses as us. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we have, on behalf of ourselves, our subsidiaries and our and their respective stockholders, renounced any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any business opportunity that may be presented to Warburg Pincus, Goldman Sachs or any of their respective affiliates, partners, principals, directors, officers, members, managers, employees or other representatives, and no such person has any duty to communicate or offer such business opportunity to us or any of our subsidiaries or shall be liable to us or any of our subsidiaries or any of our or its stockholders for breach of any duty, as a director or officer or otherwise, by reason of the fact that such person pursues or acquires such business opportunity, directs such business opportunity to another person or fails to present such business opportunity, or information regarding such business opportunity, to us or our subsidiaries, unless, in the case of any such person who is a director or officer of ours, such business opportunity is expressly offered to such director or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of ours.\nWe may not pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not currently anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Instead, we expect to retain any earnings to maintain and expand our existing operations, including through mergers and acquisitions, and to invest in the growth of our business. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends is currently limited by the terms of our credit agreement and the indenture governing the Notes, and any future credit agreement may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, to realize any return on their investment.", "PERMNO": 14244, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "EIGI"}
