{"cik": "1398805", "company": "Beam Global", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this report on Form 10-K, including the section of this report titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and related notes. If any of the events described in the following risk factors and the risks described elsewhere in this report occurs, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. This report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of factors that are described below and elsewhere in this report.\nWe have sustained recurring losses since inception and expect to incur additional losses in the foreseeable future. We were formed on June 12, 2006 and have reported annual net losses since inception. For our fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we experienced net losses of $5,213,025 and $3,933,922, respectively (reflects cash and noncash expenses under generally accepted accounting principles). Further, as of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $51,022,606. In addition, we expect to incur additional losses in the future, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve profitability. Our future viability, profitability and growth depend upon our ability to raise capital and successfully operate and expand our operations. We cannot assure that any of our efforts will prove successful or that we will not continue to incur operating losses.\nWe may need to raise additional capital or financing to continue to execute and expand our business. We expect that the net proceeds from the public offerings in 2019 and 2020 will be sufficient to sustain our operations for at least the next twelve months, until we are able to generate positive cashflow through our operations. However, we may need to raise additional capital to fund investment in our business or if it takes longer than expected to achieve positive cashflow. We may be required to pursue sources of additional capital through various means, including sale and leasing arrangements, and debt or equity financings. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities, together with our revenues from operations, is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, we may have to reduce our operations accordingly.\nWe face risks related to COVID-19 which could significantly disrupt our manufacturing, research and development, operations, sales and financial results. Our business may be adversely impacted by the effects of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). In addition to global macroeconomic effects, the COVID-19 outbreak and any other related adverse public health developments may cause disruption to our business operations and sales activities. Our employees, suppliers and customers have been and will continue to be disrupted by absenteeism, quarantines and restrictions on employees\u2019 ability to work, office and factory closures, delays on deliveries, or other travel or health-related restrictions. Depending on the magnitude of such effects on our manufacturing, or the operations of our suppliers, manufacturing and product shipments will be delayed, which could adversely affect our business, operations. In addition, COVID-19 or other disease outbreak will in the short-run, and may over the longer term, adversely affect the economies and financial markets within the U.S., resulting in an economic downturn that will affect demand for our products, impact our operating results, and have a negative impact on our stock price. There can be no assurance that any decrease in sales resulting from COVID-19 will be offset by increased sales in subsequent periods. Although the magnitude of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business and operations remains uncertain, the continued spread of the COVID-19 or the occurrence of other epidemics will adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Because we provide energy and transportation resources which we believe are considered essential services, we are able to continue to produce and deliver products. However, there is a high likelihood that we will experience disruptions to our business operations resulting from quarantines, self-isolations, or other restrictions on the ability of our employees to perform their jobs that may impact our ability to manufacture and deliver products.\nOur revenues are concentrated in a small number of customers and they may decrease significantly if we were to lose one of these customers. We have a few large customers including the City of New York and the State of California that generated 44% and 22%, respectively, of revenues in 2019 and 0% and 30%, respectively, of revenues in 2020. Electrify America, LLC was a new customer that generated 30% of our revenues in 2020. We have contracts with the City of New York and the State of California which can be used by a diverse group of state and local agencies for the purchase of our products. The receipt of orders under these contracts has been irregular and can create fluctuation in our revenues. In addition, there is no obligation for these customers to purchase any additional units, or to renew the contracts when they expire. The City of New York contract will expire on April 16, 2021. The State of California contract will expire on June 23, 2022. If either of these customers significantly reduced their purchases or terminates their contracts, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur revenue growth depends on consumers\u2019 willingness to adopt electric vehicles. Our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption of electric vehicles (\u201cEV\u201d), and we are subject to a risk of any reduced demand for EVs. If the market for EVs does not gain broad market acceptance or develops more slowly than we expect, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results may be harmed. The market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new, rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, additional competitors, evolving government regulation and industry standards, frequent new vehicle announcements, long development cycles for EV original equipment manufacturers, and changing consumer demands and behaviors. Factors that may influence the purchase and use of alternative fuel vehicles, and specifically EVs, include:\n\u00b7 perceptions about EV quality, safety (in particular with respect to lithium-ion battery packs), design, performance and cost, especially if adverse events or accidents occur that are linked to the quality or safety of EVs;\n\u00b7 the limited range over which EVs may be driven on a single battery charge and concerns about running out of power without access to sufficient charging infrastructure;\n\u00b7 improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine;\n\u00b7 the environmental consciousness of consumers;\n\u00b7 volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline;\n\u00b7 consumers\u2019 perceptions of the dependency of the U.S. on oil from unstable or hostile countries and the impact of international conflicts;\n\u00b7 government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy;\n\u00b7 access to charging stations and consumers\u2019 perceptions about convenience and cost to charge an EV; and\n\u00b7 the availability of tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate EVs or future regulation requiring increased use of nonpolluting vehicles.\nThe influence of any of these factors may negatively impact the widespread consumer adoption of EVs, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.\nWe face intense competition, and many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do. We are not aware of other companies that provide a similar infrastructure product that we do, utilizing solar energy to power EV charging. However, we compete with traditional grid-tied charging stations. Our challenge is to market our products in the industry to ensure that potential customers in this industry are aware of our product offering. Competition in the solar renewable energy and EV charging industries is intense, and competition is fragmented among a wide variety of entities. We operate in a highly competitive environment that is characterized by price fluctuations and rapid technological change. Our competitors often have greater market recognition and substantially greater resources than we do. Competition for RFPs, and in our market in general, may intensify in the future. Competitors may develop products based on new solar power technologies that may ultimately have costs similar to, or lower than, our projected costs. If we fail to compete successfully, our business would suffer and we may lose or be unable to gain market share and our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe solar energy industry and in particular, as it is utilized for EV charging, is an emerging market that is constantly evolving and may not develop to the size or at the rate we expect. The solar energy industry, especially as it applies to EV charging, is an emerging and constantly evolving market. We believe the industry will take several years to fully develop and mature, and we cannot be certain that the market will grow at the rate we expect. Any future growth of the solar energy market in general, and for EV charging in particular, and the success of our products depend on many factors beyond our control. These factors include without limitation recognition and acceptance of EVs and EV charging products by customers and users, the pricing of alternative sources of energy, a favorable regulatory environment, the continuation of expected tax benefits and other incentives and our ability to provide our product offerings cost-effectively. If the markets for EV charging do not develop at the rate we expect, our business may be adversely affected.\nTariffs imposed pursuant to Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 could significantly and adversely affect our business, revenues, margins, results of operations, and cash flows. On January 23, 2018, the President of the United States issued Proclamation 9693, which approved recommendations to impose safeguard tariffs on imported solar cells and modules, based on the investigations, findings, and recommendations of the U.S. International Trade Commission (the \u201cInternational Trade Commission\u201d). We purchase solar panels exclusively from Sunpower who is exempt from these tariffs. However, additional tariffs were imposed on other products, including cells used in our batteries. It is possible that tariffs may increase the costs and restrict the supply of certain of our components, causing us harm. The imposition of tariffs is likely to result in a wide range of impacts on the targeted U.S. industries and the global market in general. Such tariffs, if our products or the parts we use to manufacture our products are ultimately determined to be subject to them, could result in significant additional costs to us. If we elected to pass such increase in costs on to our customers, they could cause a significant reduction in demand for our products. We currently have no plans to use modules which are subject to tariffs.\nExisting regulations and policies and changes to these policies may present technical, regulatory, and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar power products, which may significantly reduce demand for our products and services. The market for electric generation products is heavily influenced by federal, state and local government laws, regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry in the United States and abroad, as well as policies adopted by electric utilities. Changes that make solar power less competitive with other power sources could result in a significant reduction in the demand for our products. The market for electric generation equipment is also influenced by trade and local content laws, regulations and policies that can discourage growth and competition in the solar industry and create economic barriers to the purchase of solar power products, thus reducing demand for our products. Any new regulations or policies pertaining to our products may result in significant additional expenses to us, which could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar power products.\nIn high demand locations, the use of our products could exhaust their electricity supply on particular days, even with our storage batteries. Our solar products create and store electricity during daylight hours. While this process has generally been effective to meet daily EV charging and energy storage demand, it is possible that heavy charging could cause a power draw exceeding the onboard electricity generation and storage capacity. In such instances, except for our grid-connected products, the EV charger would have to recharge through solar energy replenishment or other direct outside charge before EV charging could resume.\nDevelopments in alternative technologies or improvements in distributed solar energy generation may have a material adverse effect on demand for our offerings. Significant developments in alternative technologies, such as advances in other forms of distributed solar power generation, storage solutions, such as batteries, the widespread use or adoption of fuel cells for residential or commercial properties or improvements in other forms of centralized power production, transmission and distribution, may have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. Any failure by us to adopt new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could result in product obsolescence, the loss of competitiveness of our products, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors.\nDefects or performance problems in our products could result in loss of customers, reputational damage, and decreased revenue, and we may face warranty, indemnity, and product liability claims arising from defective products. Although our products meet our stringent quality requirements, they may contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new generations are released. Errors, defects, or poor performance can arise due to design flaws, defects in raw materials or components or manufacturing difficulties, which can affect both the quality and the yield of the product. Any actual or perceived errors, defects, or poor performance in our products could result in the replacement or recall of our products, shipment delays, rejection of our products, damage to our reputation, lost revenue, diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts, and increases in customer service and support costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims. If one of our products were to cause injury to someone or cause property damage, including as a result of product malfunctions, defects, or improper installation, then we could be exposed to product liability claims. We could incur significant costs and liabilities if we are sued and if damages are awarded against us. Further, any product liability claim we face could be expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention. The successful assertion of a product liability claim against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages, penalties or fines, subject us to adverse publicity, damage our reputation and competitive position, and adversely affect sales of our products. In addition, product liability claims, injuries, defects, or other problems experienced by other companies in the solar industry could lead to unfavorable market conditions for the industry as a whole and may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract new customers, thus harming our growth and financial performance.\nIf we are unable to keep up with advances in EV technology, we may suffer a decline in our competitive position. The EV industry is characterized by rapid technological change. We do not manufacture the EV service equipment (EVSE) which connects to the EV, rather, we deliver power to other vendors\u2019 EVSE products. As such, we believe that we are less prone to impacts caused by changes in EV technology. Nevertheless, if we are unable to keep up with changes in EV technology or the costs associated with such changes, our competitive position may deteriorate which would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. As technologies change, we plan to upgrade or adapt our EV products in order to continue to provide EV charging services with the latest technology.\nIf a third party asserts that we are infringing upon its intellectual property, it could be costly and time-consuming litigation, and our business may be harmed. The EV and EV charging industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets. Although we are not presently aware of any current or threatened third party intellectual property rights claims against the Company, there is a risk that the Company could face third party intellectual rights claims against its products and challenges to the validity or enforceability of its products and trademarks in the future which could harm our relationships with our customers, may deter future customers from subscribing to our services or could expose us to litigation with respect to these claims.\nThe success of our business depends in large part on our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, service mark, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be successful in obtaining these patents, service marks or trademarks, or that these applications will not be challenged, that others will not attempt to infringe upon our rights, or that these filings will afford us adequate protection or competitive advantages. If we are unable to protect our rights to our intellectual property or if such property infringes on the rights of others, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe success of our business depends on the continuing contributions of Desmond Wheatley and other key personnel who may terminate their employment with us at any time, and we will need to hire additional qualified personnel. We rely heavily on the services of Desmond Wheatley, our chairman and chief executive officer, as well as other management personnel. Loss of the services of any such individuals would adversely impact our operations. In addition, we believe our technical personnel represent a significant asset and provide us with a competitive advantage over many of our competitors. Our future success will depend upon our ability to retain these key employees and our ability to attract and retain other skilled financial, engineering, technical and managerial personnel.\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain highly qualified personnel, the quality of our services may decline and we may not successfully execute our growth strategies. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to continue to attract, train, motivate and retain highly skilled and experienced employees, including technical personnel. The loss of personnel or our inability to hire or retain sufficient personnel at competitive rates of compensation could impair our ability to secure and complete customer engagements and could harm our business.\nWe are exposed to various possible claims and hazards relating to our business, and our insurance may not fully protect us. Although we maintain modest theft, casualty, liability, cyber and property insurance coverage, along with worker\u2019s compensation and related insurance, we cannot assure that we will not incur uninsured liabilities and losses as a result of the conduct of our business. In particular, we may incur liability if one or more of our other products are deemed to have caused a personal injury. Should uninsured losses occur, they would have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and business performance.\nWe may face litigation in the future. As a manufacturer and seller of goods, we are exposed to the risk of litigation for a variety of reasons in addition to reasons relating to intellectual property rights, including product liability lawsuits, employee lawsuits, commercial contract disputes, government enforcement actions, and other legal proceedings. We cannot assure that future litigation in which we may become involved will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, business performance, and business reputation.\nThe costs incurred by us to develop and manufacture our products may be higher than anticipated which could hurt our ability to earn a profit. We may incur substantial cost overruns in the development, manufacture, and distribution of products. Unanticipated costs may force us to obtain additional capital or financing from other sources and would hinder our ability to earn a profit. If we incur cost overruns, there is no assurance that we could obtain the financing or capital to cover them. If a greater investment in the business is required because of cost overruns, the probability of earning a profit or a return of the shareholders\u2019 investment in Beam is diminished.\nThe equipment comprising our products currently charge at rates that are comparable to the average charging speed of competitors, but that may change in the future. Our standard EV ARC\u2122 as a stand-alone does not provide a DC Fast Charge, rather, it charges EVs at a Level II pace which is consistent with the majority of installed EV chargers in the U.S. To date, we have found that since most EV trips are relatively short and local, the standard EV ARC\u2122 has satisfied consumer demand. Our EV ARC\u2122 HP DC Fast Charging Electric Vehicle Autonomous Renewable Charger can provide a DC Fast Charge, so we believe we can compete in that market. Nevertheless, the demand for faster EV charging may increase in the future, requiring us to adjust our marketing and sales strategies. There is no assurance that our equipment will remain competitive in the market in the future, causing possible customer complaints and claims, and the loss of sales in the future.\nOur Company depends on key suppliers. The Company sources its materials and components from a wide variety of vendors. However, the Company has several components that are currently sourced from only one supplier. They are standard off-the-shelf components, but these components differ between manufacturers in terms of their specifications and performance. If one of these components became unavailable, it could hinder our ability to operate profitably and have a material adverse impact on our operating results, financial condition and business performance. We would be able to secure supply from another source and incorporate it in our design, but it would require modifications which could impact product deliveries. For these components, we maintain adequate supply to mitigate any supply risk.\nWe have experienced technological changes in our industry. New technologies may prove inappropriate and result in liability to us or may not gain market acceptance by our customers. The industries in which we operate are subject to constant technological change. Our future success will depend on our ability to appropriately respond to changing technologies and changes in function of products and quality. If we adopt products and technologies that are not attractive to consumers, we may not be successful in capturing or retaining a significant share of our market. In addition, some new technologies are relatively untested and unperfected and may not perform as expected or as desired, in which event our adoption of such products or technologies may cause us to lose money.\nExisting regulations, and changes to such regulations, may present technical, regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of our products, which may significantly reduce demand for our products. Installation of a small number of our products is subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances, building codes, zoning, environmental protection regulation, utility interconnection requirements for metering and other rules and regulations. In particular, our new EV Standard\u2122 product, designed to provide curbside EV charging through existing or newly installed street lampposts owned by municipalities and utilities, will require close cooperation with, and supervision by, local government agencies. We attempt to keep up-to-date about these requirements on a national, state, and local level, and must design systems to comply with varying standards. Certain cities may have ordinances that increase the cost of installation of our products. In addition, new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to power systems are unpredictable and may result in significant additional expenses or delays in the installation of our grid-connected products and, as a result, could cause a significant reduction in demand, especially for our EV Standard\u2122 product.\nOur media branding and advertising strategy may not result in a profitable operation of that segment of our business. We are able to equip our EV ARC\u2122 and Solar Tree\u00ae platforms with digital advertising screens with content that can be controlled directly, and in some cases, remotely. We may also sell other forms of media across our product platforms, such as naming rights or sponsorship deals, as well as traditional fixed media. There is no assurance that the revenue model crafted for this capability will be successful or profitable or will not result in operating losses or rejection by government regulators or consumers. Sponsors and advertisers for the service may not materialize or be willing to pay the rates sought by us or our customers.\nOur business is impacted by the availability to our customers of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives, the reduction, elimination or uncertainty of which would reduce the demand for our products. Many states offer substantial incentives to offset the cost of solar power systems, battery storage systems and EV charging infrastructure. These incentives can take many forms, including direct rebates, state tax credits, system performance payments and Renewable Energy Credits (RECs). Moreover, the federal government currently offers a 30% tax credit for the installation of solar power systems and associated energy storage systems. Effective in 2009 and currently, the federal tax credit is 30% for commercial and residential installations. There are additional federal grants available that encourage renewable investment. Businesses may also elect to accelerate the depreciation on their systems in the first year of ownership. Uncertainty about the introduction of, reduction in, or elimination of such incentives, or delays or interruptions in the implementation of favorable federal or state laws could substantially increase the cost of our systems to some of our customers, resulting in significant reductions in demand for our products from non-governmental customers, which would negatively impact our sales.\nOur business strategy may depend on the widespread adoption of solar power and EV charging technology. The market for solar power products is emerging and rapidly evolving, and its future success is uncertain. If solar power technology proves unsuitable for widespread commercial deployment or if demand for solar power products fails to develop sufficiently, we could be unable to generate enough revenues to achieve and sustain profitability and positive cash flow. The factors influencing the widespread adoption of solar power technology include but are not limited to:\n\u00b7 cost-effectiveness and efficiency of solar power technologies as compared with conventional and non-solar alternative energy technologies;\n\u00b7 performance and reliability of solar power products as compared with conventional and non-solar alternative energy products;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in economic and market conditions which impact the viability of conventional and non-solar alternative energy sources, such as increases or decreases in the prices of oil and other fossil fuels;\n\u00b7 continued deregulation of the electric power industry and broader energy industry; and\n\u00b7 availability of governmental subsidies and incentives.\nCompliance with new and existing environmental laws and rules is required. Compliance with new and existing environmental laws and rules could significantly increase construction and start-up costs for our customers, deterring customers from purchasing a small sub-set of our products and services. To install Beam\u2019s Solar Tree\u00ae products, our customers may be required to obtain and comply with a number of permitting requirements. As a condition of granting necessary permits, regulators could make demands that increase our customers\u2019 expected costs of construction and operations, in which case they may delay or cancel delivery of certain sub-sets of our products. Environmental issues, such as contamination and compliance with applicable environmental standards could arise at any time during the construction and operation of a customer\u2019s project. If this occurs, it could require a customer to spend additional resources to remedy the issues and may delay or prevent construction or operation of the project. This is why we have focused on the development of autonomous infrastructure products which do not require construction for their deployment.\nThe success of our sales is dependent upon a continued need for renewable energy. The topic of alternative fuels has retained a significant status in the consciousness of the American people, but interest in developing and utilizing alternative fuels could wane unexpectedly at any time. If such interest were lost or if the demand for alternative fuels were to decrease substantially, the Company could encounter problems generating sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability or meet its working capital requirements.\nThe success of our product offering may in some instances require the availability of locations provided by municipalities or private owners of real estate. Our ability to sell branding opportunities or licenses could be highly dependent on the availability of real estate to locate our product, or municipal approval for visible branding. We cannot assure that these rights will be available to us in the future or will be available on terms acceptable to us. The lack of availability of these rights could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in our media business unit. We may operate part of our business in which leasing or licensing agreements with venues or municipalities are necessary, so the long-term success of this aspect of our business could depend upon our ability to initiate such agreements and to renew these agreements upon their termination. We cannot assure that we will be able to renew these agreements on acceptable terms or at all, or that we will be able to obtain attractive agreements with substitute venues.\nRisks Relating to our Organization and our Common Stock\nThe Company was formerly a shell company. Because we merged with a non-operating shell company in 2010, our stock that is not registered with the SEC may become subject to certain additional restrictions if we fail in the future to stay current in our reporting requirements with the SEC.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in a delisting of our common stock, which could negatively impact the market price and liquidity of our common shares and our ability to access the capital markets. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as the corporate governance requirements, Nasdaq may take steps to delist our common stock. Such a delisting would have a negative effect on the price of our common stock, impair the ability to sell or purchase our common stock when persons wish to do so, and any delisting materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital or pursue strategic restructuring, refinancing or other transactions on acceptable terms, or at all. Delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. In the event of a delisting, we would attempt to take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements.\nOn February 26, 2021, we notified Nasdaq, that due to the death of Mr. Robert C. Schweitzer, a member of our Board and member of the Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Governance committees, who passed away on February 21, 2021, Beam was no longer in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(2)(A), which requires the Audit Committee to be comprised of a minimum of three independent directors. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(4)(B), Beam is entitled to a cure period to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(2)(A), which cure period will expire upon August 20, 2021.\nOn March 2, 2021, Nasdaq issued a letter to the Company confirming our noncompliance with the audit committee requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605 as a result of Mr. Schweitzer\u2019s death and the cure period for the Company to regain compliance under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(c)(4). The Company intends to appoint an additional independent director to the Audit Committee of the Board prior to the end of the cure period.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. This material weakness could continue to adversely affect our ability to report our results of operations and financial condition accurately and in a timely manner. If we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to disclosure controls and procedures, or, if we discover material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting, our stock price could decline and raising capital could be more difficult. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our management is likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses identified through such evaluation in those internal controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to disclosure controls and procedures, or, if we discover material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could significantly decline, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. If material weaknesses or significant deficiencies are discovered or if we otherwise fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nWe currently do not have manufacturing or purchasing systems in place to track inventory and purchasing transactions or a perpetual inventory system. The Company performs manual processes during the year to track and control our inventory and purchases. While these processes provide good results in determining inventory and cost of sales transactions, as we grow, it has become a very time-consuming process and could impact our ability to submit timely reporting. We plan to invest in new systems in 2021 to automate these functions. We intend to take certain remedial actions intended to address the identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. However, we can give no assurance that such measures will remediate the material weakness identified or that any additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future.\nOur stock price may be volatile. The public market trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile, may decline, and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7 changes in our industry;\n\u00b7 competitive pricing pressures;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain working capital financing;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 limited \u201cpublic float\u201d in the hands of a small number of persons whose sales or lack of sales could result in positive or negative pricing pressure on the market price for our common stock;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock privately or in the public market, by us or by other shareholders;\n\u00b7 our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u00b7 operating results that fall below expectations;\n\u00b7 loss of any strategic relationship;\n\u00b7 adverse regulatory developments;\n\u00b7 adverse economic and other external factors;\n\u00b7 additional dilution of ownership because of the issuance of new securities by us, and period-to-period fluctuations in our financial condition or operating results.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or upon the expiration of any statutory holding period under Rule 144 or issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, the market price of our common stock could decline because of or in anticipation of the selling pressure. The existence of anticipated sales, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, also could make more difficult our ability to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.", "PERMNO": 18553, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "EVSI"}
