{"cik": "1078207", "company": "NAUTILUS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nNautilus operates in an environment that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that presently are not considered material or are not known to us, and therefore are not mentioned herein, may impair our business operations. If any of the risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K actually occur, our business, operating results and financial position could be adversely affected.\nOur revenues and profitability can fluctuate from period to period and are often difficult to predict due to factors beyond our control.\nOur results of operations in any particular period may not be indicative of results to be expected in future periods, and have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, subject to periodic fluctuations arising from a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nIntroduction and market acceptance of new products and sales trends affecting specific existing products;\n\u2022\nVariations in product selling prices and costs and the mix of products sold;\n\u2022\nSize and timing of Retail customer orders, which, in turn, often depend upon the success of our customers' businesses or specific products;\n\u2022\nChanges in the market conditions for consumer fitness equipment;\n\u2022\nChanges in macroeconomic factors;\n\u2022\nAvailability of consumer credit;\n\u2022\nTiming and availability of products coming from our offshore contract manufacturing suppliers;\n\u2022\nSeasonality of markets, which vary from quarter-to-quarter and are influenced by outside factors such as overall consumer confidence and the availability and cost of television advertising time;\n\u2022\nEffectiveness of our media and advertising programs;\n\u2022\nCustomer consolidation in our Retail segment, or the bankruptcy of any of our larger Retail customers;\n\u2022\nRestructuring charges;\n\u2022\nGoodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges; and\n\u2022\nLegal and contract settlement charges.\nThese trends and factors could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial position and cash flows in any particular period.\nIntense competition or loss of one or more of our large Retail customers could negatively impact our sales and operating results.\nOur products are sold in highly competitive markets with limited barriers to entry. As a result, introduction by competitors of lower-priced or more innovative products could result in a significant decline in our revenues and have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows.\nAdditionally, we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of Retail customers. A loss of business from one or more of these large customers, if not replaced with new business, could negatively affect our operating results and cash flow.\nA decline in sales of TreadClimber\u00ae and/or Max Trainer\u00ae products without a corresponding increase in sales of other products would negatively affect our future revenues and operating results.\nSales of cardio products, especially TreadClimber\u00ae and Max Trainer\u00ae products, represent a substantial portion of our Direct segment revenues. Introduction by competitors of comparable products at lower price-points, a maturing product lifecycle or other factors could result in a decline in our revenues derived from these products. A significant decline in our sales of these products would have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows.\nPortions of our operating expenses and costs of goods sold are relatively fixed, and we may have limited ability to reduce expenses sufficiently in response to any revenue shortfalls.\nMany of our operating expenses are relatively fixed. We may not be able to adjust our operating expenses or other costs sufficiently to adequately respond to any revenue shortfalls. If we are unable to reduce operating expenses or other costs quickly in response to any declines in revenue, it would negatively impact our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences or to effectively develop, market and sell future products, our future revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur future success depends on our ability to effectively develop, market and sell new products that respond to new and evolving consumer preferences. Accordingly, our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected if we are unable to develop or acquire rights to new products that satisfy consumer preferences. In addition, any new products that we market may not generate sufficient revenues to recoup their acquisition, development, production, marketing, selling and other costs.\nDecline in consumer spending would likely negatively affect our product revenues and earnings.\nSuccess of each of our products depends substantially on the amount of discretionary funds available to our customers. Global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme disruptions in the recent past, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. There can be no assurance that similar disruptions will not occur in the future. Deterioration in general economic conditions may depress consumer spending, especially spending for discretionary consumer products such as ours. Poor economic conditions could in turn lead to substantial decreases in our net sales or have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows.\nOur business is affected by seasonality which results in fluctuations in our operating results.\nWe experience fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Sales are typically strongest in the first and fourth quarters, followed by the third quarter, and are generally weakest in the second quarter. However, the mix of product sales may vary\nconsiderably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of fitness equipment. In addition, our customers may cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nGovernment regulatory actions could disrupt our marketing efforts and product sales.\nVarious international and U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities, including the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, regulate our product and marketing efforts. Our sales and profitability could be significantly harmed if any of these authorities commence a regulatory enforcement action that interrupts our marketing efforts, results in a product recall or negative publicity, or requires changes in product design.\nSubstantially higher advertising rates or a significant decline in availability of media time may hinder our ability to effectively market our products and may reduce profitability.\nWe depend on television advertising to market certain products sold directly to consumers. Consequently, a marked increase in the price we must pay for our preferred media time and/or a reduction in its availability may adversely impact our financial performance.\nWe may be unable to adapt to significant changes in media consumption habits, which could diminish the effectiveness or efficiency of our advertising.\nNew television technologies and services, such as video-on-demand, digital video recorders and Internet streaming services are changing traditional patterns of television viewing. Additionally, consumer attention is increasingly fragmented across a variety of games, apps, the Internet and other digital media. If we are unable to successfully adapt our media strategies to new television viewing and media consumption habits, the effectiveness and efficiency of our media placements could be adversely affected, and our operating results may be harmed.\nOur revenues could decline due to changes in credit markets and decisions made by credit providers.\nHistorically, a significant portion of our Direct sales have been financed for our customers under various programs offered by third-party consumer credit financing sources. Reductions in consumer lending and the availability of consumer credit could limit the number of customers with the financial means to purchase our products. Higher interest rates could increase monthly payments for consumer products financed through one of our financing partners or through other sources of consumer financing. In the past, we have partnered with financial service companies to assist our customers in obtaining financing to purchase our products. Our present agreements with our third party consumer credit financing providers enable certain customers to obtain financing if they qualify for the provider's private label revolving credit card. We cannot be assured that our third party financing providers will continue to provide consumers with access to credit or that credit limits under such arrangements will not be reduced. Such restrictions or reductions in the availability of consumer credit could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and anticipated benefits of acquisitions may not be realized.\nOn December 31, 2015, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of OF Holdings, Inc., sole parent of Octane. The ultimate success of our acquisition of Octane, and any future acquisitions we may complete, depends, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated synergies, channel and product diversification and growth opportunities from integrating newly-acquired businesses or assets into our existing businesses. However, the acquisition and successful integration of independent businesses or assets is a complex, costly and time-consuming process, and the benefits we realize may not meet targeted expectations. The risk and difficulties associated with acquiring and integrating companies and other assets include, among others:\n\u2022\nconsolidating research and development, logistics, product sourcing, human resources, information technology and other aspects of the combined operations, where appropriate;\n\u2022\nintegrating newly-acquired businesses and product lines into a uniform financial reporting system;\n\u2022\ncoordinating sales, distribution and marketing functions and strategies across new and existing channels of trade;\n\u2022\nestablishing or expanding manufacturing, research and development, sales, distribution and marketing functions in order to accommodate newly-acquired businesses or product lines or rationalizing these functions to take advantage of synergies;\n\u2022\npreserving the important licensing, research and development, manufacturing and supply, distribution, marketing, customer and other relationships of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nminimizing the diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically separate operations; and\n\u2022\nregulatory and legal issues relating to the integration of legacy and newly-acquired businesses.\nThe purchase consideration and other costs and expenses of acquisitions could negatively impact our net income and earnings per share and a failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIf our contract manufacturers experience any delay, disruption or quality control problems in their operations, we could lose revenues, and our reputation and market share may be harmed.\nWe have outsourced the production of all of our products to third-party manufacturers. We rely on our contract manufacturers to procure components and provide spare parts in support of our warranty and customer service obligations. We generally commit the manufacturing of each product to a single contract manufacturer.\nOur reliance on contract manufacturers exposes us to the following risks over which we may have limited control:\n\u2022\nUnexpected increases in manufacturing and repair costs;\n\u2022\nInterruptions in shipments if our contract manufacturer is unable to complete production;\n\u2022\nInability to completely control the quality of finished products;\n\u2022\nInability to completely control delivery schedules;\n\u2022\nChanges in our contract manufacturer's business models or operations;\n\u2022\nPotential increases in our negotiated product costs as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nImpact of the global market and economic conditions on the financial stability of our contract manufacturers and their ability to operate without requesting earlier payment terms or letters of credit;\n\u2022\nPotential lack of adequate capacity to manufacture all or a part of the products we require; and\n\u2022\nPotential unauthorized reproduction or counterfeiting of our products.\nSubstantially all of our contract manufacturers are located in Asia, primarily China and Taiwan, and may be subject to disruption by natural disasters, as well as political, social or economic instability. The temporary or permanent loss of the services of any of our primary contract manufacturers could cause a significant disruption in our product supply chain and operations and delays in product shipments.\nOur third-party manufacturing contracts are generally of annual or shorter duration, or manufactured products are sourced on the basis of individual purchase orders. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current relationships with these parties or, if necessary, establish future arrangements with other third-party manufacturers on commercially reasonable terms. Further, while we maintain an active quality control, factory inspection and qualification program, we cannot assure that their manufacturing and quality control processes will be maintained at a level sufficient to meet our inventory needs or prevent the inadvertent sale of substandard products. While we believe that products manufactured by our current third-party manufacturers could generally be procured from alternative sources, temporary or permanent loss of services from a significant manufacturer could cause disruption in our supply chain and operations.\nOur inventory purchases are subject to long lead times, which could negatively impact our sales, cash flows and liquidity.\nAll of our products are produced by third-party manufacturers, substantially all of which are located in Asia, primarily China and Taiwan. Lead times for inventory purchases from our Asian suppliers, from order placement to receipt of goods, generally range from approximately two to three months, of which transit time represents three-to-four weeks. The length of our lead times requires us to place advance manufacturing orders based on management forecasts of future demand for our products. Due to the length of our lead times, our sales and cash flows may be negatively impacted if we do not have sufficient inventory on hand to meet customer demand for such items. In addition, our liquidity and cash flows may be negatively affected, and inventory obsolescence may increase, if the quantity of products we order exceeds customer demand for such items.\nA delay in getting non-U.S.-sourced products through port operations and customs in a timely manner could result in reduced sales, canceled sales orders and unanticipated inventory accumulation.\nMost of our imported products are subject to duties or tariffs that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the U.S. or our other markets. The countries in which our products are produced or sold may adjust or impose new quotas,\nduties, tariffs or other restrictions. Further, our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. As a result, we rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide. Labor disputes at various ports create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing seasons. Any of these factors could result in reduced sales, canceled sales orders and unanticipated inventory accumulation and have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows.\nUnpredictable events and circumstances relating to our international operations, including our use of non-U.S. manufacturers, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSubstantially all of our products are manufactured outside of the U.S. and a portion of our revenue is derived from sales outside the U.S., primarily in Canada, but also in markets outside North America. Accordingly, our future results could be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors pertaining to international trade, including: changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions; trade restrictions; import and export licensing requirements; changes in regulatory requirements; additional efforts to comply with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and longer payment cycles in certain countries, thus requiring us to finance customer purchases over a longer period than those made in the U.S. In addition, we rely on the performance of our employees located in foreign countries. Our ability to control the actions of these employees may be limited by the laws and regulations in effect in each country. Changes in any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could result in higher costs, reduced margins or decreased international sales.\nSubstantially all of our products are manufactured outside of the U.S. and, therefore, currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in higher costs for our products, or could disrupt the business of independent manufacturers that produce our products, by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we, our customers or our suppliers conduct business. Past fluctuations in currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar have caused our costs for certain products to increase, reducing our margins and cash flows. Similar fluctuations and cost increases may occur in the future. If we are unable to increase our selling prices to offset such cost increases, or if such increases have a negative impact on sales of our products, our revenues and margins would be reduced and our operating results and cash flows would be negatively impacted. In addition, a portion of our revenue is derived from sales outside the U.S., primarily in Canada and Europe. Currency rate fluctuations could make our products more expensive for foreign consumers and reduce our sales, which would negatively affect our operating results and cash flows.\nWe may face competition from providers of comparable products in categories where our patent protection is limited or reduced due to patent expiration. Increased competition in those product categories could negatively affect our future revenues and operating results.\nWhile we own a number of patents covering aspects of our TreadClimber\u00ae products, the introduction of comparable products designed to compete with our TreadClimber\u00ae line of specialized cardio machines may increase in the future as a result of certain patent expirations. Sales of cardio products, including TreadClimber\u00ae and Max Trainer\u00ae products, represent a substantial portion of our Direct segment revenues. Introduction by competitors of comparable products, a maturing product lifecycle or other factors could result in a decline in our revenues derived from these products. A significant decline in our sales of these products, without offsetting sales gains, would have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows.\nFailure or inability to protect our intellectual property could significantly harm our competitive position.\nProtecting our intellectual property is an essential factor in maintaining our competitive position in the health and fitness industry. Failure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual property rights could impact our competitiveness. We rely on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property rights. Many factors bear upon the exclusive ownership and right to exploit intellectual properties, including, without limitation, prior rights of third parties and nonuse and/or nonenforcement by us and/or related entities. While we make efforts to develop and protect our intellectual property, the validity, enforceability and commercial value of our intellectual property rights may be reduced or eliminated. We cannot be sure that our intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own or, where appropriate, license intellectual property rights necessary to compete successfully within the marketplace for our products. We cannot be sure that these rights, if obtained, will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future. If we do not, or are unable to, adequately protect our intellectual property, then we may face difficulty in differentiating our products from those of our competitors and our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nTrademark infringement or other intellectual property claims relating to our products could increase our costs.\nOur industry is susceptible to litigation regarding trademark and patent infringement and other intellectual property rights. We could become a plaintiff or defendant in litigation involving trademark or patent infringement claims or claims of breach of license. The prosecution or defense of intellectual property litigation is both costly and disruptive of the time and resources of our management, regardless of the claim's merit. We could also be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs to resolve intellectual property litigation or related matters.\nWe also may not be able to successfully acquire intellectual property rights, protect existing rights, or potentially prevent others from claiming that we have violated their proprietary rights. We could incur substantial costs in defending against such claims even if they are without basis, and we could become subject to judgments or settlements requiring us to pay substantial damages, royalties or other charges.\nFuture impairments of intangible assets could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe had goodwill of $60.5 million and other intangible assets of $73.4 million as of December 31, 2015. Any future impairment charges, if significant, could materially and adversely affect our operating results. An unexpected decline in revenue, changes in market conditions, changes in competitive products or technologies or a change in management's intentions regarding utilization of intangible assets could lead to future impairment charges.\nWe are subject to periodic litigation, product liability risk and other regulatory proceedings which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources.\nFrom time to time, we may be a defendant in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business or the former operations of our discontinued Commercial business segment. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any significant litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could divert management's attention from our operations and may result in substantial legal costs.\nWe are subject to warranty claims for our products which could result in unexpected expense.\nMany of our products carry warranties for defects in quality and workmanship. We may experience significant expense as the result of product quality issues, product recalls or product liability claims which may have a material adverse effect on our business. We maintain a warranty reserve for estimated future warranty claims. However, the actual costs of servicing future warranty claims may exceed the reserve and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDisruption to our information and communication systems could result in interruptions to our business and potential implementation of new systems for critical business functions may heighten the risk of disruption.\nOur business is reliant on information and communication technology, and a substantial portion of our revenues are generated with the support of information and communication systems. The success of our Direct business is heavily dependent on our ability to respond to customer sales inquiries and process sales transactions using our call center communication systems, Internet websites and similar data monitoring and communication systems provided and supported by third-parties. If such systems were to fail, or experience significant or lengthy interruptions in availability or service, our revenues could be materially affected. We also rely on information systems in all stages of our product cycle, from design to distribution, and we use such systems as a method of communication between employees, suppliers and customers. In addition, we use information systems to maintain our accounting records, assist in trade receivables collection and customer service efforts, and forecast operating results and cash flows.\nSystem failures or service interruptions may occur as the result of a number of factors, including: computer viruses; hacking or other unlawful activities by third parties; disasters; equipment, hardware or software failures; ineffective design or implementation of new systems or systems upgrades; cable outages, extended power failures, or our inability or failure to properly protect, repair or maintain our communication and information systems. To mitigate the risk of business interruption, we have in place a disaster recovery program that targets our most critical operational systems. If our disaster recovery system is ineffective, in whole or in part, or efforts conducted by us or third-parties to prevent or respond to system interruptions in a timely manner are ineffective, our ability to conduct operations would be significantly affected. If we do not consider the potential impact of critical decisions related to systems or process design and implementation, this could lead to operational challenges and increased costs. Any of the aforementioned factors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches and cyber attacks could disrupt our operations.\nWe manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business, including sensitive and personally identifiable information. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.\nExperienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our systems. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \"bugs\" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.", "PERMNO": 86889, "SIC": 3949, "TIC": "NLS"}
