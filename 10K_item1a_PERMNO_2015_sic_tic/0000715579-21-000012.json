{"cik": "715579", "company": "ACNB CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-05", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nCOVID-19 PANDEMIC RISKS\nTHE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS ADVERSELY IMPACTED ACNB\u2019S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS, AND THE ULTIMATE IMPACT WILL DEPEND ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, WHICH ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND CANNOT BE PREDICTED, INCLUDING THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF THE PANDEMIC AND ACTIONS TAKEN BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global, national and local economies, disrupted global and national supply chains, lowered equity market valuations, created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets, and increased unemployment levels. In addition, the pandemic resulted in temporary closures of and restrictions on many businesses and the institution of social distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states and communities and may result in the same or similar restrictions in the future. As a result, the demand for ACNB\u2019s products and services have been and may continue to be significantly adversely impacted, which could adversely and extensively affect ACNB\u2019s revenue and results of operations. Furthermore, the pandemic could continue to result in the recognition of credit losses in ACNB\u2019s loan portfolios and increases in ACNB\u2019s allowance for loan losses, particularly if businesses remain restricted or are required to close again, the impact on the global, national and local economies worsen, or more customers draw on their lines of credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses. Similarly, because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, ACNB may be required to recognize further impairments on the securities they hold as well as reductions in other comprehensive income. ACNB\u2019s business operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of their workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts ACNB\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as their regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend on the continuing impact of current developments and future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nACNB continues to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and related risks as they evolve. The magnitude and duration of the current outbreak of COVID-19, further outbreaks of COVID-19, future actions taken by governmental authorities and/or other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and its future direct and indirect effects on the global, national and local economies and ACNB\u2019s business and results of operation are highly uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause prolonged global or national recessionary economic conditions or longer lasting effects on economic conditions than currently exist, which could have a material adverse effect on ACNB\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDUE TO ACNB\u2019S PARTICIPATION IN THE U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION (SBA) PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM (PPP), ACNB IS SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL RISKS OF LITIGATION FROM ITS CLIENTS OR OTHER PARTIES REGARDING THE PROCESSING OF LOANS FOR THE PPP AND RISKS THAT THE SBA MAY NOT FUND SOME OR ALL PPP LOAN GUARANTIES.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted, which included a $349 billion loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals could apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders. ACNB participated as a lender in the PPP. Because of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and the opening of the PPP, there was some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP along with the continually evolving nature of the SBA rules, interpretations and guidelines concerning this program, which exposes ACNB to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP. Since the launch of the PPP, several large banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP. As such, ACNB may be\nexposed to the risk of litigation, from both clients and non-clients that approached ACNB regarding PPP loans, relative to its process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. If any such litigation is filed against ACNB and is not resolved in a manner favorable to ACNB, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect ACNB\u2019s reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs, or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on ACNB\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nACNB also has credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, underwritten, certified by the borrower, funded, or serviced by ACNB, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, certified by the borrower, funded, or serviced by ACNB, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from ACNB.\nCREDIT RISKS\nACNB IS SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK.\nACNB\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond ACNB\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the amount of interest ACNB receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) ACNB\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of ACNB\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of ACNB\u2019s mortgage-backed securities portfolio. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, ACNB\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings.\nAlthough management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on ACNB\u2019s results of operations, any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on ACNB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nACNB IS SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISK.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 68% of ACNB\u2019s loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial, construction, and commercial real estate loans. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or consumer loans. These types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans. Because ACNB\u2019s loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and industrial, construction, and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non-performing loans. An increase in non-performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses, and an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on ACNB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nACNB\u2019S ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES MAY BE INSUFFICIENT.\nACNB maintains an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, that represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of the following: industry concentrations; specific credit risks; loan loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions; and, unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires ACNB to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, and other factors, both within and outside of ACNB\u2019s control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review ACNB\u2019s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. Further, if charge-\noffs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, ACNB will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income, and possibly capital, and may have a material adverse effect on ACNB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nBUSINESS RISKS\nCOMPETITION FROM OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ACNB\u2019S PROFITABILITY.\nACNB\u2019s banking subsidiary faces substantial competition in originating both commercial and consumer loans. This competition comes principally from other banks, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, and other lenders. Many of its competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources with higher lending limits, wider geographic presence, more branch office locations, the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives, and lower origination and operating costs. This competition could reduce the Corporation\u2019s net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that its banking subsidiary originates and the interest rates it may charge on these loans.\nIn attracting business and consumer deposits, its banking subsidiary faces substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks, savings institutions, and credit unions, as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds. Many of ACNB\u2019s competitors enjoy advantages, including greater financial resources, wider geographic presence, more aggressive marketing campaigns, better brand recognition, more branch office locations, the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives, and lower origination and operating costs. These competitors may offer higher interest rates than ACNB, which could decrease the deposits that it attracts or require it to increase its rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. Increased deposit competition could adversely affect the subsidiary\u2019s ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations. As a result, it may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase its cost of funds.\nACNB\u2019s banking subsidiary also competes with nonbank providers of financial services, such as brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, insurance companies and agencies, and governmental organizations which may offer more favorable terms. Some of its nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern ACNB\u2019s banking operations. As a result, such nonbank competitors may have advantages over ACNB\u2019s banking subsidiary in providing certain products and services. This competition may reduce or limit ACNB\u2019s margins on banking services, reduce its market share, and adversely affect its earnings and financial condition.\nTHE BASEL III CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS MAY REQUIRE ACNB TO MAINTAIN HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL, WHICH COULD REDUCE ACNB\u2019S PROFITABILITY.\nBasel III targets higher levels of base capital, certain capital buffers, and a migration toward common equity as the key source of regulatory capital. Although the new capital requirements are phased in over future years and may change substantially before final implementation, Basel III signals a growing effort by domestic and international bank regulatory agencies to require financial institutions, including depository institutions, to maintain higher levels of capital. The direction of the Basel III implementation activities or other regulatory viewpoints could require additional capital to support the Corporation\u2019s business risk profile prior to final implementation of the Basel III standards. If ACNB and the subsidiary bank are required to maintain higher levels of capital, ACNB and the subsidiary bank may have fewer opportunities to invest capital into interest-earning assets, which could limit the profitable business operations available to ACNB and the subsidiary bank and adversely impact ACNB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nTHE CORPORATION\u2019S OPERATIONS OF ITS BUSINESS, INCLUDING ITS TRANSACTIONS WITH CUSTOMERS, ARE INCREASINGLY DONE VIA ELECTRONIC MEANS, AND THIS HAS INCREASED ITS RISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY.\nThe Corporation is exposed to the risk of cyberattacks in the normal course of business. In addition, the Corporation is exposed to cyberattacks on vendors and merchants that affect the Corporation and its customers. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. The Corporation has observed an increased level of attention in the industry focused on cyber-attacks that include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. To combat against these attacks, policies and procedures are in place to prevent or limit the effect of the possible security breach of its information systems. While ACNB maintains insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions including significant self-insured deductibles, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses. While the Corporation has not incurred any material losses related to cyberattacks, nor is it aware of any specific or threatened cyber incidents as of the date of this report, it may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences if it falls victim to successful cyberattacks. Such negative consequences could include remediation costs that may include liability\nfor stolen assets or information and repairing system damage that may have been caused; deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third-party experts and consultants; lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack; disruption or failures of physical infrastructure, operating systems or networks that support ACNB\u2019s business and customers resulting in the loss of customers and business opportunities; additional regulatory scrutiny and possible regulatory penalties; litigation; and, reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence.\nACNB\u2019S CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES MAY FAIL OR BE CIRCUMVENTED.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates ACNB\u2019s internal controls, disclosure controls, and procedures, as well as corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of ACNB\u2019s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on ACNB\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nACNB\u2019S ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS DEPENDS PRIMARILY ON DIVIDENDS FROM ITS BANKING SUBSIDIARY, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY LIMITS AND THE BANKING SUBSIDIARY PERFORMANCE.\nACNB is a financial holding company and its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. Its ability to pay dividends depends on its receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries. Dividend payments from its banking subsidiary are subject to legal and regulatory limitations, generally based on net profits and retained earnings, imposed by the various banking regulatory agencies. The ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends is also subject to their profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures, and other cash flow requirements. There is no assurance that its subsidiaries will be able to pay dividends in the future or that ACNB will generate adequate cash flow to pay dividends in the future. ACNB\u2019s failure to pay dividends on its common stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of its common stock.\nNEW LINES OF BUSINESS OR NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY SUBJECT ACNB TO ADDITIONAL RISKS.\nFrom time to time, ACNB may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, ACNB may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business and/or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of ACNB\u2019s system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business and new products or services could have a material adverse effect on ACNB\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nACNB MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN SKILLED PEOPLE.\nACNB\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities engaged in by ACNB can be intense, and ACNB may not be able to hire people or to retain them. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of ACNB\u2019s key personnel could have a material adverse impact on ACNB\u2019s business because the Corporation would no longer have the benefit of their skills, knowledge of ACNB\u2019s market, as well as years of industry experience, and it would be difficult to promptly find qualified replacement personnel. ACNB and/or one of its subsidiaries currently has employment agreements, including covenants not to compete, with the following named executive officers: its President & Chief Executive Officer; Executive Vice President/Secretary & Chief Governance Officer; Executive Vice President/Treasurer & Chief Financial Officer; and, the Executive Vice President/Chief Lending & Revenue Officer of ACNB Bank.\nACNB IS SUBJECT TO CLAIMS AND LITIGATION PERTAINING TO FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY.\nFrom time to time, customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to ACNB\u2019s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to ACNB\u2019s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to ACNB, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of ACNB and its products and services, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on ACNB\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on ACNB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIF ACNB CONCLUDES THAT THE DECLINE IN VALUE OF ANY OF ITS INVESTMENT SECURITIES IS AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, ACNB IS REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF THAT SECURITY THROUGH A CHARGE TO EARNINGS.\nACNB reviews its investment securities portfolio at each quarter-end to determine whether the fair value is below the current carrying value. When the fair value of any of its investment securities has declined below its carrying value, ACNB is required to assess whether the decline is an other-than-temporary impairment. If ACNB determines that the decline is an other-than-temporary impairment, it is required to write down the value of that security through a charge to earnings for credit related impairment. Non-credit related reductions in the value of a security do not require a write down of the value through earnings unless ACNB intends to, or is required to, sell the security. Changes in the expected cash flows related to the credit related piece of the investment of a security in ACNB\u2019s investment portfolio or a prolonged price decline may result in ACNB\u2019s conclusion in future periods that an impairment is other than temporary, which would require a charge to earnings to write down the security to fair value. Due to the complexity of the calculations and assumptions used in determining whether an asset has an impairment that is other than temporary, the impairment disclosed may not accurately reflect the actual impairment in the future.\nACNB IS SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES.\nACNB has certain long-lived assets including purchased intangible assets subject to amortization and associated goodwill assets which are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the statement of condition and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.\nAccounting rules permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The goodwill impairment analysis involves comparing the reporting unit\u2019s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. Subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted.\nGoodwill, which has an indefinite useful life, is evaluated pursuant to ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, for impairment annually and is evaluated for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset\u2019s fair value. The goodwill impairment analysis involves comparing the reporting unit\u2019s estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. Subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted. ACNB performs an annual evaluation to determine if there is goodwill impairment.\nACNB IS SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH LENDING ACTIVITIES.\nA significant portion of ACNB\u2019s banking subsidiary loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, ACNB may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, ACNB may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require ACNB to incur substantial expense and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit ACNB\u2019s ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase ACNB\u2019s exposure to environmental liability. Although ACNB has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on ACNB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nACNB\u2019S INFORMATION SYSTEMS MAY EXPERIENCE AN INTERRUPTION OR BREACH IN SECURITY.\nACNB relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in ACNB\u2019s customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. While ACNB has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures,\ninterruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. Although ACNB maintains insurance coverage that may, subject to policy terms and conditions including significant self-insured deductibles, cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of ACNB\u2019s information systems could damage ACNB\u2019s reputation adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, result in a loss of customer business, subject ACNB to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible regulatory penalties, or expose ACNB to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on ACNB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nSTRATEGIC AND EXTERNAL RISKS\nACNB\u2019S PROFITABILITY DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA AND THE STATE OF MARYLAND.\nACNB\u2019s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the State of Maryland, and the specific local markets in which ACNB operates. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, ACNB provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in the southcentral Pennsylvania and northern Maryland region of the country. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for ACNB\u2019s products and services, as well as the ability of ACNB\u2019s customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing the loans, and the stability of ACNB\u2019s deposit funding sources. A significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences, unemployment, changes in securities markets, or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on ACNB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nTHE EARNINGS OF FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY GENERAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.\nACNB\u2019s operations and profitability are impacted by general business and economic conditions in the United States and abroad. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, money supply, political issues, legislative and regulatory changes, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, broad trends in industry and finance, and the strength of the U.S. economy and the local economies in which ACNB operates, all of which are beyond ACNB\u2019s control. Deterioration in economic conditions could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and non-performing assets, decreases in loan collateral values, and a decrease in demand for ACNB\u2019s products and services, among other things, any of which could have a material adverse impact on ACNB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe regulatory environment for the financial services industry is being significantly impacted by financial regulatory reform initiatives in the United States and elsewhere, including Dodd-Frank and regulations promulgated to implement it.\nDodd-Frank, which was signed into law on July 21, 2010, comprehensively reforms the regulation of financial institutions, products and services. Dodd-Frank requires various federal regulatory agencies to implement numerous rules and regulations. Because the federal agencies are granted broad discretion in drafting these rules and regulations, many of the details and the impact of Dodd-Frank may not be known for many months or years.\nWhile much of how Dodd-Frank and other financial industry reforms will change ACNB\u2019s current business operations depends on the specific regulatory reforms and interpretations, many of which have yet to be released or finalized, it is clear that the reforms, both under Dodd-Frank and otherwise, will have a significant effect on the entire industry. Although Dodd-Frank and other reforms will affect a number of the areas in which ACNB does business, it is not clear at this time the full extent of the adjustments that will be required and the extent to which ACNB will be able to adjust its businesses in response to the requirements. Although it is difficult to predict the magnitude and extent of these effects at this stage, ACNB believes compliance with Dodd-Frank and implementing its regulations and initiatives will negatively impact revenue and increase the cost of doing business, both in terms of transition expenses and on an ongoing basis, and it may also limit ACNB\u2019s ability to pursue certain business opportunities.\nTHE TRADING VOLUME IN ACNB\u2019S COMMON STOCK IS LESS THAN THAT OF OTHER LARGER FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES.\nACNB\u2019s common stock trades on NASDAQ, and the trading volume in its common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of ACNB\u2019s common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which ACNB has no control. Given the lower trading volume of ACNB\u2019s common stock, significant sales of ACNB\u2019s common stock, and the\nexpectation of these sales, could cause ACNB\u2019s stock price to fall.\nACNB OPERATES IN A HIGHLY REGULATED ENVIRONMENT AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.\nACNB, primarily through its banking subsidiary, is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and/or examination by federal and state banking authorities. Any change in applicable regulations or federal, state or local legislation could have a substantial impact on ACNB and its operations. Additional legislation and regulations that could significantly affect ACNB\u2019s powers, authority and operations may be enacted or adopted in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. Further, regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank and financial holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. The exercise of regulatory authority may have a negative impact on ACNB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nLike other financial holding companies and financial institutions, ACNB must comply with significant anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws. Under these laws, ACNB is required, among other things, to enforce a customer identification program and file currency transaction and suspicious activity reports with the federal government. Government agencies have substantial discretion to impose significant monetary penalties on institutions which fail to comply with these laws or make required reports. While ACNB has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur.\nTHE SOUNDNESS OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ACNB.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. ACNB has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose ACNB to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or customer. In addition, ACNB\u2019s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by ACNB cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit exposure due to ACNB. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on ACNB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nMARKET VOLATILITY MAY HAVE MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECTS ON ACNB\u2019S LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.\nThe capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption. Over the last several years, in some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on stock prices, security prices, and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial strength. If the market disruption and volatility returns, there can be no assurance that ACNB will not experience adverse effects, which may be material, on its liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nACNB MAY NEED OR BE COMPELLED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE WHICH COULD DILUTE SHAREHOLDERS OR BE UNAVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED OR AT UNFAVORABLE TERMS.\nACNB\u2019s regulators or market conditions may require it to increase its capital levels. If ACNB raises capital through the issuance of additional shares of its common stock or other securities, it would likely dilute the ownership interests of current investors and would likely dilute the per share book value and earnings per share of its common stock. Furthermore, it may have an adverse impact on ACNB\u2019s stock price. New investors may also have rights, preferences and privileges senior to ACNB\u2019s current shareholders, which may adversely impact its current shareholders. ACNB\u2019s ability to raise additional capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside its control, and on its financial performance. Accordingly, ACNB cannot be assured of its ability to raise additional capital on terms and/or in time frames acceptable to it, or to raise additional capital at all. If ACNB cannot raise additional capital in sufficient amounts when needed, its ability to comply with regulatory capital requirements could be materially impaired. Additionally, the inability to raise capital in sufficient amounts may adversely affect ACNB\u2019s operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nACNB\u2019S FUTURE ACQUISITIONS COULD DILUTE SHAREHOLDER OWNERSHIP AND MAY CAUSE IT TO BECOME MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO ADVERSE ECONOMIC EVENTS.\nACNB may use its common stock to acquire other companies or make investments in banks and other complementary businesses in the future. ACNB may also issue additional shares of common stock to pay for future acquisitions, which would dilute current investors\u2019 ownership interest in ACNB. Future business acquisitions could be material to ACNB, and the degree of success achieved in acquiring and integrating these businesses into ACNB could have a material effect on the value of\nACNB\u2019s common stock. In addition, any acquisition could require it to use substantial cash or other liquid assets or to incur debt. In those events, ACNB could become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures.\nPENNSYLVANIA BUSINESS CORPORATION LAW AND VARIOUS ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS UNDER ACNB\u2019S ARTICLES AND BYLAWS COULD IMPEDE THE TAKEOVER OF ACNB.\nVarious Pennsylvania laws affecting business corporations may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire ACNB, even if the acquisition would be advantageous to shareholders. In addition, ACNB has various anti-takeover measures in place under its articles of incorporation and bylaws, including a supermajority vote requirement for mergers, a staggered Board of Directors, and the absence of cumulative voting. Any one or more of these measures may impede the takeover of ACNB without the approval of the Board of Directors and may prevent shareholders from taking part in a transaction in which they could realize a premium over the current market price of ACNB common stock.\nTHE SEVERITY AND DURATION OF A FUTURE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND THE COMPOSITION OF THE BANKING SUBSIDIARY\u2019S LOAN PORTFOLIO COULD IMPACT THE LEVEL OF LOAN CHARGE-OFFS AND THE PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES AND MAY AFFECT ACNB\u2019S NET INCOME OR LOSS.\nLending money is a substantial part of ACNB\u2019s business through its banking subsidiary. However, every loan that ACNB makes carries a certain risk of non-payment. ACNB cannot assure that its allowance for loan losses will be sufficient to absorb actual loan losses. ACNB also cannot assure that it will not experience significant losses in its loan portfolio that may require significant increases to the allowance for loan losses in the future.\nAlthough ACNB evaluates every loan that it makes against its underwriting criteria, ACNB may experience losses by reasons of factors beyond its control. Some of these factors include changes in market conditions affecting the value of real estate and unexpected problems affecting the creditworthiness of ACNB\u2019s borrowers.\nACNB determines the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses by considering various factors, including:\n\u2022An analysis of the risk characteristics of various classifications of loans;\n\u2022Previous loan loss experience;\n\u2022Specific loans that would have loan loss potential;\n\u2022Delinquency trends;\n\u2022Estimated fair value of the underlying collateral;\n\u2022Current economic conditions;\n\u2022The views of ACNB\u2019s regulators;\n\u2022Reports of internal auditors;\n\u2022Reports of external auditors;\n\u2022Reports of loan reviews conducted by independent organizations; and,\n\u2022Geographic and industry loan concentrations.\nLocal economic conditions could impact the loan portfolio of ACNB. For example, an increase in unemployment, a decrease in real estate values, or increases in interest rates, as well as other factors, could weaken the economies of the communities ACNB serves. Weakness in the market areas served by ACNB could depress the Corporation\u2019s earnings and, consequently, its financial condition because:\n\u2022Borrowers may not be able to repay their loans;\n\u2022The value of the collateral securing ACNB\u2019s loans to borrowers may decline; and/or,\n\u2022The quality of ACNB\u2019s loan portfolio may decline.\nAlthough, based on the aforementioned procedures implemented by ACNB, management believes the current allowance for loan losses is adequate, ACNB may have to increase its provision for loan losses should local economic conditions deteriorate which could negatively impact its financial condition and results of operations.\nCHANGES IN REAL ESTATE VALUES MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT ACNB\u2019S BANKING SUBSIDIARY LOANS THAT ARE SECURED BY REAL ESTATE.\nA significant portion of ACNB\u2019s banking subsidiary loan portfolio consists of residential and commercial mortgages, as well as consumer loans, secured by real estate. These properties are concentrated in Adams County, Pennsylvania. Real estate values and real estate markets generally are affected by, among other things, changes in national, regional or local economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates, the availability of loans to potential purchasers, changes in the tax laws and other government statutes, regulations and policies, and acts of nature. If real estate prices decline, particularly in ACNB\u2019s market area, the value of the real estate collateral securing ACNB\u2019s loans could be reduced. This reduction in the value of the collateral could increase the number of non-performing loans and could have a material adverse impact on ACNB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nACNB CONTINUALLY ENCOUNTERS TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. ACNB\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in ACNB\u2019s operations. Many of ACNB\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. ACNB may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on ACNB\u2019s business and, in turn, ACNB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES DEPEND ON THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF INFORMATION ABOUT CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, ACNB may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports, and other financial information. ACNB may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports, or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on ACNB\u2019s business and, in turn, ACNB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nCONSUMERS MAY DECIDE NOT TO USE BANKS TO COMPLETE THEIR FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods. For example, consumers can now maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation\u201d, could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on ACNB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT SECONDARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY.\nIn addition to primary sources of liquidity in the form of deposits and principal and interest payments on outstanding loans and investments, ACNB maintains secondary sources that provide it with additional liquidity. These secondary sources include secured and unsecured borrowings from sources such as the Federal Reserve Bank, Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, and third-party commercial banks. However, market liquidity conditions have been negatively impacted by past disruptions in the capital markets and could, in the future, have a negative impact on ACNB\u2019s secondary sources of liquidity.\nSEVERE WEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS, ACTS OF WAR OR TERRORISM, AND OTHER EXTERNAL EVENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT ACNB\u2019S BUSINESS.\nThe unpredictable nature of events such as severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on ACNB\u2019s ability to conduct business. If any of its financial, accounting, network or other information processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings due to external events, ACNB could be materially adversely affected. Third parties with which ACNB does business could also be sources of operational risk\nto ACNB, including the risk that the third parties\u2019 own network and information processing systems could fail. Any of these occurrences could materially diminish ACNB\u2019s ability to operate one or more of the Corporation\u2019s businesses, or result in potential liability to customers, reputational damage, and regulatory intervention, any of which could materially adversely affect ACNB. Such events could affect the stability of ACNB\u2019s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, impair ACNB\u2019s liquidity, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue, and/or cause ACNB to incur additional expenses.\nACNB may be subject to disruptions or failures of the financial, accounting, network and/or other information processing systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond ACNB\u2019s control, which may include, for example, computer viruses, electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters, disease pandemics, damage to property or physical assets, or terrorist acts. ACNB has developed a comprehensive business continuity plan which includes plans to maintain or resume operations in the event of an emergency, such as a power outage or disease pandemic, and contingency plans in the event that operations or systems cannot be resumed or restored. The business continuity plan is updated as needed, periodically reviewed, and components are regularly tested. ACNB also reviews and evaluates the business continuity plans of critical third-party service providers. While ACNB believes its business continuity plan and efforts to evaluate the business continuity plans of critical third-party service providers help mitigate risks, disruptions or failures affecting any of these systems may cause interruptions in service to customers, damage to ACNB\u2019s reputation, and loss or liability to the Corporation.\nCHANGES IN CONTROL OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND ISSUES RELATING TO DEBT AND THE DEFICIT MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE CORPORATION.\nChanges in elected officials in the federal government could result in significant changes or uncertainty in governmental policies, regulatory environments, spending sentiment, and many other factors and conditions, some of which could adversely impact the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, as a result of past difficulties of the federal government to reach agreement over federal debt and issues connected with the debt ceiling, certain rating agencies placed the United States government\u2019s long-term sovereign debt rating on their equivalent of negative watch and announced the possibility of a rating downgrade. The rating agencies, due to constraints related to the rating of the United States, also placed government-sponsored enterprises in which the Corporation invests and receives lines of credit on negative watch, and a downgrade of the Unites States government\u2019s credit rating would trigger a similar downgrade in the credit rating of these government-sponsored enterprises. Furthermore, the credit rating of other entities, such as state and local governments, may also be downgraded should the United States government\u2019s credit rating be downgraded. The impact that a credit rating downgrade may have on the national and local economy could have an adverse effect on ACNB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nACNB\u2019S BANKING SUBSIDIARY MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY HIGHER FDIC INSURANCE PREMIUMS OR SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS EARNINGS.\nPoor economic conditions and the resulting bank failures increased the costs of the FDIC and adversely impacted its Deposit Insurance Fund. Any additional bank failures may prompt the FDIC to increase its premiums or to issue special assessments. ACNB is generally unable to control the amount of premiums or special assessments that its banking subsidiary is required to pay for FDIC insurance. Any future changes in the calculation or assessment of FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on ACNB\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nFEDERAL INCOME TAX REFORM COULD HAVE UNFORESEEN EFFECTS ON ACNB\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nIn 2017, the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d was enacted. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes a number of provisions, including the lowering of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. There are also provisions that may partially offset the benefit of such rate reduction. Financial statement impacts include adjustments for, among other things, the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. While there are benefits, there is also substantial uncertainty regarding the details of U.S. Tax Reform. The long-term intended and unintended consequences of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on the Corporation\u2019s business and on holders of ACNB common shares is uncertain and could be adverse. ACNB anticipates that the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may be material to its business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, recent electoral changes and results may result in new tax legislation which may have an adverse impact on the Corporation and its operations.\nTHE INCREASING USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS PRESENTS NEW RISKS AND CHALLENGES AND THE INABILITY OR FAILURE TO RECOGNIZE, RESPOND TO, AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE ACCELERATED IMPACT OF SOCIAL MEDIA COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACT ACNB\u2019S BUSINESS.\nThere has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms, including weblogs (blogs), social media websites, and other forms of internet-based communications which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Social media practices in the banking industry are evolving, which creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to ACNB\u2019s business. Consumers value readily-available information concerning businesses and their goods and services, and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. Information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to ACNB\u2019s interests and/or may be inaccurate. The dissemination of information online could harm ACNB\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of the information\u2019s accuracy. The harm may be immediate without affording ACNB an opportunity for redress or correction.\nOther risks associated with the use of social media include improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about ACNB\u2019s business, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, out-of-date information, and improper use by employees and customers. The inappropriate use of social media by ACNB\u2019s employees or customers could result in negative consequences such as remediation costs including training for employees, additional regulatory scrutiny, and possible regulatory penalties, litigation, or negative publicity that could damage ACNB\u2019s reputation adversely affecting customer or investor confidence.\nA NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD MAY REQUIRE ACNB TO INCREASE ITS ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES AND MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ACNB\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nA new accounting standard will result in a significant change in how ACNB recognizes credit losses and may have a material impact on ACNB\u2019 s financial condition or results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the current \u201cincurred loss\u201d model for recognizing credit losses with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) model. Under the CECL model, ACNB will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the \u201cincurred loss\u201d model required under current generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, ACNB expects that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how ACNB determines the allowance for loan losses and could require ACNB to significantly increase the allowance. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of ACNB\u2019s allowance for loan losses. If ACNB is required to materially increase the level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect ACNB\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUntil recently, the new CECL standard was expected to become effective for ACNB on January 1, 2020, and for interim periods within that year. In October 2019, FASB voted to delay implementation of the new CECL standard for certain companies, including those companies that qualify as a smaller reporting company under SEC rules, until January 1, 2023. ACNB currently expects to continue to qualify as a smaller reporting company, based upon the current SEC definition, and as a result will likely be able to defer implementation of the new CECL standard for a period of time. Nevertheless, ACNB continues to evaluate the impact the CECL model will have on the accounting for credit losses, but ACNB expects to recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to the allowance for loan losses as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective, consistent with regulatory expectations set forth in interagency guidance issued at the end of 2016. ACNB cannot yet determine the magnitude of such one-time cumulative-effect adjustment or of the overall impact of the new standard on ACNB\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIONS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, COULD SUBJECT ACNB AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO SIGNIFICANT FINES, PENALTIES, JUDGMENTS, OR OTHER REQUIREMENTS RESULTING IN INCREASED EXPENSES OR RESTRICTIONS ON BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.\nIn the normal course of business, from time to time, ACNB or its subsidiaries may be named as a defendant in various legal actions, arising in connection with current and/or prior business activities. Legal actions could include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Further, ACNB or its subsidiary bank may in the future be subject to consent orders or other formal or informal enforcement agreements with regulators. They may also, from time to time, be the subject of subpoenas, requests for information, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding current and/or prior business activities. Any such legal or regulatory actions may subject ACNB or its subsidiaries to substantial compensatory or punitive damages, significant fines, penalties, obligations to change business practices, or other requirements resulting in increased expenses, diminished income, and damage to their reputation. Involvement in any such matters, whether tangential or otherwise, and even if the matters are ultimately determined in their favor, could also cause significant harm to their reputation and divert management attention from the operation of their business. Further, any settlement, consent order, other enforcement agreement or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by governmental agencies may result in litigation, investigations or proceedings as other litigants and governmental agencies begin independent reviews of the same activities. As a result, the outcome of legal and regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on ACNB\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nPOTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS MAY DISRUPT ACNB\u2019S BUSINESS AND DILUTE SHAREHOLDER VALUE.\nACNB regularly evaluates opportunities to acquire and invest in banks and in other complementary businesses. As a result, ACNB may engage in negotiations or discussions that, if they were to result in a transaction, could have a material effect on ACNB\u2019s operating results and financial condition, including short- and long-term liquidity and capital structure. ACNB\u2019s acquisition activities could be material to ACNB. For example, ACNB could issue additional shares of common stock in a purchase transaction, which could dilute current shareholders\u2019 ownership interest. These activities could require ACNB to use a substantial amount of cash, other liquid assets, and/or incur debt. In addition, if goodwill recorded in connection with ACNB\u2019s prior or potential future acquisitions were determined to be impaired, then ACNB would be required to recognize a charge against its earnings, which could materially and adversely affect ACNB\u2019s results of operations during the period in which the impairment was recognized. Any potential charges for impairment related to goodwill would not impact cash flow, tangible capital or liquidity but would decrease shareholders\u2019 equity.\nACNB\u2019s acquisition activities could involve a number of additional risks, including the risks of:\n\u2022Incurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions;\n\u2022Using inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management, and market risks with respect to the target institution or its assets;\n\u2022The time and expense required to integrate the operations and personnel of the combined businesses;\n\u2022Creating an adverse short-term effect on ACNB\u2019s results of operations; and,\n\u2022Losing key employees and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received.\nACNB may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with potential acquisitions. ACNB\u2019s inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on ACNB\u2019s ability to achieve its business strategy and maintain its market value.\nTHE STOCK MARKET CAN BE VOLATILE, AND FLUCTUATIONS IN ACNB\u2019S OPERATING RESULTS AND OTHER FACTORS COULD CAUSE ACNB\u2019S STOCK PRICE TO DECLINE.\nThe stock market has experienced, and may continue to experience, fluctuations that significantly impact the market prices of securities issued by many companies and financial institutions specifically. Market fluctuations could adversely affect ACNB\u2019s stock price. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic, systemic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, loss of investor confidence, interest rate changes, government shutdowns, trade wars, pandemics or epidemics, or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of ACNB\u2019s common stock. Moreover, ACNB\u2019s operating results may fluctuate and vary from period to period due to the risk factors set forth herein. As a result,\nperiod-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. ACNB\u2019s stock price could fluctuate significantly in response to ACNB\u2019s quarterly or annual results, annual projections and the impact of these risk factors on ACNB\u2019s operating results or financial position.\nAlthough ACNB\u2019s common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the volume of trades on any given day has been limited historically, as a result of which shareholders might not have been able to sell or purchase ACNB\u2019s common stock at the volume, price, or time desired. From time to time, ACNB\u2019s common stock may be included in certain and various stock market indices. Inclusion in these indices may positively impact the price, trading volume, and liquidity of ACNB\u2019s common stock, in part, because index funds or other institutional investors often purchase securities that are in these indices. Conversely, if ACNB\u2019s market capitalization falls below the minimum necessary to be included in any of the indices at any annual reconstitution date, the opposite could occur. Further, ACNB\u2019s inclusion in indices may be weighted based on the size of ACNB\u2019s market capitalization, so even if ACNB\u2019s market capitalization remains above the amount required to be included on these indices, if ACNB\u2019s market capitalization is below the amount it was on the most recent reconstitution date, ACNB\u2019s common stock could be weighted at a lower level. If ACNB\u2019s common stock is weighted at a lower level, holders attempting to track the composition of these indices will be required to sell ACNB\u2019s common stock to match the reweighting of the indices.\nWEALTH MANAGEMENT AND INSURANCE INDUSTRY RISKS\nREVENUES AND PROFITABILITY FROM ACNB\u2019S WEALTH MANAGEMENT BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ANY REDUCTION IN ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION AS A RESULT OF EITHER A DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS OR NET OUTFLOWS, WHICH COULD REDUCE TRUST, INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND BROKERAGE, AND OTHER SERVICING FEES EARNED.\nThe wealth management business derives the majority of its revenue from noninterest income which consists of trust, investment advisory and brokerage, and other servicing fees. Substantial revenues are generated from investment management contracts with clients. Under these contracts, the investment advisory fees paid to us are typically based on the market value of assets under management. Assets under management and supervision may decline for various reasons including declines in the market value of the assets in the funds and accounts managed or supervised, which could be caused by price declines in the securities markets generally or by price declines in specific market segments. Assets under management may also decrease due to redemptions and other withdrawals by clients or termination of contracts. This could be in response to adverse market conditions or in pursuit of other investment opportunities. Any reduction in assets under management and supervision may adversely impact ACNB\u2019s profitability.\nTHE WEALTH MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION, SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION BY REGULATORS, AND ANY ENFORCEMENT ACTION OR ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE LAWS OR REGULATIONS GOVERNING ACNB\u2019S WEALTH MANAGEMENT BUSINESS COULD DECREASE ACNB\u2019S REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.\nThe wealth management business is subject to regulation by a number of regulatory agencies that are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of customers participating in those markets. In the event of noncompliance with an applicable regulation, governmental regulators, including the SEC and FINRA, may institute administrative or judicial proceedings that may result in censure, fines, civil penalties, issuance of cease-and-desist orders, deregistration or suspension of the noncompliant broker-dealer or investment advisor, or other adverse consequences. The imposition of any such penalties or orders could have a material adverse effect on the wealth management segment\u2019s operating results and financial condition. ACNB may also be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations. Regulatory changes have imposed and may continue to impose additional costs, which may adversely impact ACNB\u2019s profitability.\nREVENUES AND PROFITABILITY FROM ACNB\u2019S INSURANCE BUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH COULD REDUCE INSURANCE COMMISSIONS AND FEES EARNED.\nThe revenues of ACNB\u2019s fee-based insurance business are derived primarily from commissions from the sale of insurance policies, which commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the policy premium. These insurance policy commissions can fluctuate as insurance carriers from time to time increase or decrease the premiums on the insurance products sold. Due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market and macroeconomic conditions on insurance premiums, commission levels may vary. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility and/or declines in premiums, may adversely impact ACNB\u2019s profitability.", "PERMNO": 12480, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "ACNB"}
