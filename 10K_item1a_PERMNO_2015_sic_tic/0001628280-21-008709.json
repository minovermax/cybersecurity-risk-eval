RISK FACTORS\nOur current business and future results may be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. It is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors that could impact us. For example, the current pandemic related to the COVID-19 coronavirus is causing a dramatic negative impact on the health of citizens globally which has negatively affected the economies and markets around the world. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIssues identified by the FDA in the FDA Warning Letter and additional product quality issues identified by us will have a negative impact on our business, financial position, operating results and cash flows and will delay the FDA\u2019s pre-approval inspection of our newly installed injectable line.\nWe received a warning letter from the FDA in November 2019 relating to our Buena, NJ manufacturing facility resulting from an inspection at such facility from April 2, 2019 to May 20, 2019 (the \u201cFDA Warning Letter\u201d). The FDA Warning Letter cited issues regarding out-of-specification test results, our stability program, our complaint handling, and drug product validation issues. We investigated the issues with the assistance of a consultant, responded to the FDA in December 2019 and March 2020, and submitted a final closeout letter on April 12, 2020. On August 13, 2020, we received an additional comment letter from the FDA in which the FDA indicated that it had reviewed our responses and deemed them to be inadequate as we failed to address and/or provide supporting documentation to several of the concerns raised in the FDA Warning Letter. We have since submitted response letters to the FDA outlining certain changes in our practices, submitting additional documentation to support previous and ongoing independent assessments, providing updates to our organizational structure, and providing additional detail on ongoing remediation projects (including comprehensive product quality assessments) to ensure all of our products are safe, effective and compliant.\nAs part of our efforts to remediate the issues identified in the FDA Warning Letter and to strengthen our quality systems, we undertook a comprehensive review of all of our products that we completed in the fourth quarter of 2020. While the review did not identify material issues with many of our products, it did identify issues of non-conformance with respect to certain products, which has resulted in recalls and halting the production of certain products, that we are actively reviewing and remediating. As a result, there have been, and we believe there will continue to be, supply disruptions or process changes with respect to these products including product recalls, long-term production pauses, short-term clear path to market production pauses, and continued production with minor process corrections. We believe disruptions with respect to certain of our products and the diversion of resources to remediate the product quality issues will have a negative impact on our business, financial position, operating results and cash flows for the fourth quarter of 2020 and during 2021, including reducing revenue, negatively impacting operating/(loss), and possibly resulting in impairment and other charges. Further, we anticipate that the FDA\u2019s issuance of the FDA Warning Letter and review of our processes will continue to delay the FDA\u2019s pre-approval inspection for commercial production on the newly installed injectable line at our Buena, NJ facility. The continued failure to address the issues identified by the FDA in the FDA Warning Letter and those subsequently identified by us in our comprehensive product quality review as well as the continued delay in obtaining the FDA\u2019s pre-approval inspection for commercial production on the newly installed injectable line at the Buena, NJ facility will have a negative impact on our business, financial position, operating results and cash flows.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken in response to it may result in additional disruptions to our business operations.\nOur business and operations, including but not limited to ongoing or planned research and development activities, have been adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has also caused significant disruption in the operations of third parties upon which we rely. The COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in response to it (including executive orders, shelter-in-place orders and work-from-home policies) have had effects that have and may continue to negatively impact productivity and disrupt our business. For example, in response to public health directives and orders, we have implemented work-from-home policies for all non-production employees and adjusted our production schedule to concentrate on high demand or low stock product. Additionally, we initiated a reduction in force at our Buena, NJ\nmanufacturing facility and shifted our research and development operation being performed in our Tallinn, Estonia office to our manufacturing facility in Buena, NJ.\nThese and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business, financial position, operating results and cash flows.\nIf COVID-19 continues to spread in the United States and elsewhere, we may experience additional disruptions that could severely impact our business and development activities, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022delays in necessary interactions with and approvals from the FDA and other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022strain on our suppliers or other third parties, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or customer delays in purchases or payments for our products;\n\u2022delays in manufacturing of our pharmaceutical products;\n\u2022decreases in dermatology visits and thus patient demand for our topical pharmaceutical products; and\n\u2022the ability to raise capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe rely on a limited number of customers for a large portion of our revenues.\nWe depend on a limited number of customers for a large portion of our revenue. We have three customers that accounted for approximately 47% of our revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and we have two customers that accounted for 41% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a significant impact on our revenues and harm our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nDue to our dependence on a limited number of products, our business will be materially adversely affected if these products do not perform as well as expected.\nWe expect to generate a significant portion of our total revenues and gross margin from the sale of a limited number of products. While we continue to diversify our product portfolio, none of our products accounted for more than 10% of our revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, and one of our products accounted for 15% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. Any material adverse developments, including increased competition, loss of customers, pricing pressures and supply shortages, with respect to the sale or use of our products and prospective products, or our failure to successfully introduce such products, could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and gross margin.\nThe pharmaceutical industry in which we operate is intensely competitive.\nThe pharmaceutical industry in which we operate is intensely competitive. The competition that we encounter has an effect on our product prices, market share, revenue and profitability. Depending upon how we respond to this competition, its effect may be materially adverse to us. We compete with, among others, the original manufacturers of the brand-name equivalents of our generic products, and other generic drug manufacturers.\nMost of the products that we are developing are either generic drugs or products without patent protection. These drugs are therefore more subject to direct competition than patented products. In addition, because many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, production and research and development resources, substantially larger sales and marketing organizations, and substantially greater name recognition than we have, we are particularly subject to the risks inherent in competing with them. We may not be able to successfully develop or introduce new products that are less costly than those of our competitors or offer purchasers of our products payment and other commercial terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors, any of which may adversely impact our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nAs our competitors introduce their own generic equivalents of our generic pharmaceutical products, our revenues and gross margin from such products may decline, potentially rapidly.\nRevenues and gross margin derived from generic pharmaceutical products often follow a pattern based on regulatory and competitive factors that we believe are unique to the generic pharmaceutical industry. As the patent(s) for a brand name product and the statutory marketing exclusivity period (if any) expires, the first generic manufacturer to receive regulatory approval for a generic equivalent of the product often is able to capture a substantial share of the market. However, as other generic manufacturers receive regulatory approvals for identical competing products, that market share, and the price of that product, may decline depending on several factors, including the number of competitors, the price of the brand product and the pricing strategy of the new competitors. Further, in the event we encounter delays in testing and manufacturing new pharmaceutical products, submitting applications for, and obtaining, regulatory approval, and commercializing new products, our competitors\nmay successfully launch competing products ahead of us, reducing our competitive advantage and ability to successfully market and sell our products. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to continue to develop such products or that the number of competitors with such products will not increase to such an extent that we may stop marketing a product for which we previously obtained approval, which may have a material adverse impact on our revenues and gross margin.\nIf pharmaceutical companies are successful in limiting the use of generics through their legislative, regulatory and other efforts, sales of our generic products may be adversely impacted.\nMany pharmaceutical companies increasingly have used state and federal legislative and regulatory means to delay generic competition, including competition from generic manufacturers such as us. These efforts have included, among others:\n\u2022pursuing new patents for existing products that may be granted just before the expiration of earlier patents, which could extend patent protection for additional years or otherwise delay the launch of generics;\n\u2022selling the brand product as an \u201cauthorized generic,\u201d either by the brand company directly, through an affiliate or by a marketing partner;\n\u2022using the Citizen Petition process to request amendments to FDA standards or otherwise delay generic drug approvals;\n\u2022seeking changes to the U.S. Pharmacopeia, an FDA, and industry recognized compendia of drug standards;\n\u2022attaching patent extension amendments to non-related federal legislation;\n\u2022engaging in state-by-state initiatives to enact legislation that restricts the substitution of some generic drugs, which could have an impact on products that we are developing; and\n\u2022seeking patents on methods of manufacturing certain active pharmaceutical ingredients.\nIf pharmaceutical companies or other third parties are successful in limiting the use of generic products through these or other means, our sales of our generic products may decline, which may adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be significantly and adversely impacted.\nOur generics business also faces increasing competition from brand-name manufacturers that do not face any significant regulatory approval or other barriers to enter into the generics market.\nOur generics business also faces increasing competition from brand-name manufacturers that do not face any significant regulatory approval or other barriers to enter into the generics market. These brand-name companies sell \u201cauthorized generic\u201d versions of their products to the market directly, acquire or form strategic alliances with our competitor generic pharmaceutical companies, or grant them rights to sell \u201cauthorized generics.\u201d Moreover, brand-name companies continually seek new ways to delay the introduction of generic products and decrease the impact of generic competition, such as filing new patents on drugs whose original patent protection is about to expire, developing patented controlled-release products, changing product claims and product labeling, or developing and marketing as over-the-counter products those branded products that are about to face generic competition, when feasible. Our competitors, which include major multinational corporations with substantially more resources than we have, are consolidating in both the branded and generics industries, and the strength of the combined companies could affect our competitive position in all of our business areas. Furthermore, if one of our competitors or its customers acquires any of our customers or suppliers, we may lose business from the customer or lose a supplier of a critical raw material.\nSales of our products may continue to be adversely affected by the continuing consolidation of our distribution network and the concentration of our customer base.\nOur principal customers are wholesale drug distributors and major retail drug store chains. These customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the U.S. This distribution network is continuing to undergo significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions, alliances and partnerships among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drug store chains. As a result, a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market, and the number of independent drug stores and small drug store chains has decreased. We expect that consolidation of drug wholesalers and retailers will increase pricing and other competitive pressures on drug manufacturers. In addition, we generally do not enter into long-term supply agreements with our customers that would require them to purchase our products. The result of these developments may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nLack of availability, issues with quality or significant increases in the cost of raw materials used in manufacturing our products, and inventory challenges could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results.\nAffordable, high quality raw materials and packaging components are essential to our business due to the nature of the products we manufacture. We maintain several single-source supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous due to regulatory, performance, quality, support or price considerations. In this type of limited-supplier situation, increased prices, rationing and/or shortages can occur. In response to the situation, we try to identify alternative materials or suppliers for such raw materials and finished goods like containers and closures. However, FDA requirements for products approved through the ANDA or NDA process could substantially lengthen the time for approval of an alternate material source. Certain material shortages and approval of alternate sources could adversely affect our ability to develop, commercialize and sell certain of our products and may adversely affect our business and financial results, which may be more significant if such single-supplier issues affect our higher volume or more profitable products.\nIn addition, raw materials purchased from third parties, including those from foreign countries, may contain counterfeit ingredients or other adulterants. We maintain a strict program of verification and product testing throughout the ingredient sourcing and manufacturing process to identify potential counterfeit ingredients, adulterants and toxic substances. Nevertheless, discovery of previously unknown problems with the raw materials or product manufacturing processes, or new data suggesting an unacceptable safety risk associated therewith, could result in a voluntary or mandatory withdrawal of a potentially contaminated product from the marketplace, either temporarily or permanently. In addition, because regulatory authorities must generally approve raw material sources for pharmaceutical products, changes in raw material suppliers or the quality of their products may result in production delays or higher raw material costs. Also, any future recall or removal would result in additional costs to us, may significantly harm our reputation, and may give rise to product liability or other litigation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur products, and the raw materials used to make those products, generally have limited shelf lives. Our inventory levels are based, in part, on expectations regarding future sales. We may experience build-ups in inventory if sales slow. Any significant shortfall in sales may result in higher inventory levels of raw materials and finished products, thereby increasing the risk of inventory spoilage and corresponding inventory write-downs and write-offs, which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, labeling changes required for regulatory compliance could render packaging inventories obsolete. Cargo thefts and/or diversions and economically or maliciously motivated product tampering in store shelves may be experienced from time to time, causing unexpected shortages.\nWe are subject to stringent regulatory requirements related to environmental protection and hazardous waste disposal.\nIn the United States, we and our suppliers of raw materials are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other current and potential future federal, state or local regulations. In Canada, we and our suppliers of raw materials are also subject to regulation under the Hazardous Products Act, Controlled Products Regulations, Consumer Product Safety Act, Canadian Environmental Protection Act and other current and potential future federal, provincial/territorial or local regulations. Failure to adhere to such regulations, by either us or our suppliers, could harm our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, because chemical ingredients are used in the manufacture of our products and due to the nature of the manufacturing process itself, there is a risk of incurring liability for damages caused by or during the storage or manufacture of both the chemical ingredients and the finished products. We have implemented safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials, however, such procedures may not comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state and local regulations. Even if we follow such safety procedures for handling and disposing of hazardous materials and chemicals and such procedures comply with applicable law, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. Although we have never incurred any material liability for damages of that nature, we may be subject to liability in the future. In addition, while we believe our insurance coverage is adequate, it is possible that a successful claim would exceed our coverage, requiring us to pay a substantial sum.\nOur operations and properties are also subject to a wide variety of increasingly complex and stringent federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater. Such environmental laws may apply to conditions at properties and facilities presently or formerly owned or operated by us, as well as to conditions at properties at which wastes or other contamination attributable to us have been sent or otherwise come to be located. One of our former facilities is currently undergoing remediation of environmental contamination. Based on information provided to us from our environmental consultants and what is known to date, we believe the reserves are sufficient for the remaining remediation of the environmental contamination. There is a possibility, however, that the remediation costs may exceed our estimates. In addition, we can give no assurance that the future cost of compliance with existing environmental laws will not give rise to additional significant expenditures or liabilities that would be material to us. Future events, such as new information, changes in existing environmental laws or their interpretation, and more vigorous enforcement policies of federal,\nstate or local regulatory agencies, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation by the FDA, Health Canada and other federal, state, provincial/territorial and local regulatory authorities.\nThe manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling, testing, storing, distributing, marketing, advertising and sale of our products, among other things, are subject to extensive regulation by one or more U.S. or Canadian agencies, including the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Products Safety Commission, Health Canada, as well as by several state, provincial/territorial and local agencies in localities where our products are stored, distributed or sold. In addition, we manufacture and market certain of our products in accordance with standards set by organizations, such as the USP, British Pharmacopeia, or BP, scientific nonprofit organizations that sets standards for the identity, strength, quality, and purity of medicines, food ingredients, and dietary supplements manufactured, distributed and consumed worldwide. Adherence to USP and BP published drug standards are prescribed by the FDA and the Canadian Food and Drug Regulations, as applicable.\nThe FDA and Health Canada regulate the testing, manufacture, labeling, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products. Approval by the FDA or Health Canada is required before any new drug, including any new generic drug, may be marketed or sold in the United States or Canada. To obtain approval from the FDA and Health Canada for our product candidates that are generic versions of brand-name drugs, we intend to submit an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) in the United States and an Abbreviated New Drug Submission (ANDS), or Drug Identification Number Application (DINA) in Canada. These require us to demonstrate to the FDA or Health Canada that each generic product candidate has the same active ingredient, strength, dosage form, route of administration and intended use as a corresponding approved drug product and is bioequivalent to the branded drug product (approved under a New Drug Application (NDA) in the United States, or a New Drug Submission (NDS) or DINA in Canada), meaning that there is no significant difference between the drugs in their rate and extent of absorption in the body. However, if the FDA determines that an ANDA, or Health Canada determines that an ANDS or DINA, for a generic drug product is not adequate to support approval, it could deny our application or request additional data or information, which could delay approval of the product and impair our ability to compete with the brand-name drug product and/or other generic versions of the product\nIf our product candidates receive FDA or Health Canada approval through the ANDA, ANDS or DINA processes, as applicable, the labeling claims and marketing statements that we can make for our generic drugs are generally limited to the claims approved by the FDA or Canada for use in the brand-name product\u2019s label. In addition, following regulatory approval, the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising and promotion for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. Our ongoing compliance with these ongoing regulatory requirements could result in additional information requests from the FDA or Health Canada and potentially result in a request from the agency to conduct a product recall or to strengthen warnings and/or revise other label information about the product. Any of these regulatory actions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a manufacturer, importer and distributor of pharmaceutical products, we must also comply with cGMPs, or current Good Manufacturing Practices, which include requirements related to production processes, quality control and assurance and recordkeeping. Our manufacturing facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA or Health Canada and foreign regulatory agencies to ensure compliance with cGMP and other requirements applicable to such products. Any material deviations from pharmaceutical cGMPs or other applicable requirements identified during such inspections may result in recalls or other enforcement actions, including warning letters and non-compliance ratings, a delay or suspension in manufacturing operations, consent decrees or civil or criminal penalties. Further, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer may result in restrictions or sanctions, including suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals, seizures or recalls of products from the market, or civil or criminal fines or penalties, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has introduced additional strains on FDA and Health Canada and has presented uncertainty on the impact this may cause on regulations or the related timeframes pertaining to communication with, or receiving approvals from, FDA and Health Canada.\nOur actual or perceived failure to comply with U.S. federal and state, and foreign laws and regulations imposing obligations on how we collect, use, disclose, store and process personal information could result in liability or reputational harm and could harm our business.\nIn many activities, including the conduct of clinical trials, we are subject to laws and regulations governing data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. These laws and regulations govern our processing of personal data,\nincluding the collection, access, use, analysis, modification, storage, transfer, security breach notification, destruction and disposal of personal data. We must comply with laws and regulations associated with the international transfer of personal data based on the location in which the personal data originates and the location in which it is processed. Complying with the enhanced obligations imposed by the General Data Privacy Regulation, or the GDPR, to and other applicable international and US privacy laws and regulations may result in significant costs to our business and require us to amend certain of our business practices. Further, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. The future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations and/or future enforcement actions or investigations could have a materially adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability.\nThe privacy and security of personally identifiable information stored, maintained, received or transmitted, including electronically, subject to significant regulation in the United States and abroad. While we strive to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and regulations, legal standards for privacy continue to evolve and any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings.\nWe could experience business interruptions at our manufacturing facility.\nWe manufacture drug products at one domestic manufacturing facility, which may be forced to shut down or may be unable to operate at full capacity as a result of hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, storms and other extreme weather events as well as strikes, war, violent upheavals, terrorist acts, pandemics and other force majeure events. A significant disruption at this facility, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship drug products to the market on a timely basis, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nAny failure to comply with our reporting and payment obligations related to our participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, could subject us to investigation, penalties, and sanctions.\nFederal laws regarding reporting and payment obligations with respect to a pharmaceutical company\u2019s participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, are complex. These programs generally require us to pay rebates or provide discounts to government payors in connection with our products that are dispensed to beneficiaries of these programs. In some cases, such as with the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the rebates are based on pricing and rebate calculations that we report on a quarterly basis to the government agencies that administer the programs. Because our processes for calculating applicable government prices and the judgments involved in making these calculations involve subjective decisions and complex methodologies, these calculations are subject to risk of errors and differing interpretations. In addition, they are subject to review and challenge by the applicable governmental agencies, and it is possible that such reviews could result in changes that may have material adverse legal, regulatory, or economic consequences. Responding to current and future changes may increase our costs and the complexity of compliance will be time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur policies regarding returns, allowances and chargebacks, failure to supply penalties and marketing programs adopted by wholesalers may reduce revenues in future fiscal periods.\nWe, like other generic drug manufacturers, have agreements with customers allowing chargebacks, product returns, administrative fees, failure to supply penalties and other rebates. Under many of these arrangements, we may match lower prices offered to customers by competitors. If we choose to lower our prices and, if contractually obligated, we issue a credit on the products that the customer is holding in inventory, it could reduce sales revenue and gross margin for the period the credit is provided. Under many of these arrangements, in the event we are unable to supply a certain product and are unable to meet the needs of our customers, we may incur failure to supply penalties which may be significant. Like our competitors, we also give credits for chargebacks to wholesalers with whom we have contracts for their sales to hospitals, group purchasing organizations, pharmacies or other customers. A chargeback is the difference between the price at which we invoice the wholesaler and the price that the wholesaler\u2019s end-customer pays for a product. Although we establish reserves based on prior experience and our best estimates of the impact that these policies may have in subsequent periods, we cannot ensure that our reserves are adequate or that actual product returns, allowances, and chargebacks will not exceed our estimates. As we continue to experience the consolidation of our customers, which may result in changes to previous patterns of ordering and/or pricing of our products, this could disrupt our established methodologies for calculating our provisions for chargebacks and other accruals.\nWe are subject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse and false claims laws and may be subject to related litigation brought by the government or private individuals.\nWe are subject to state and federal healthcare laws pertaining to fraud and abuse, physician payment transparency and laws that govern the submission of claims for reimbursement. These laws include the following:\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;\n\u2022the federal False Claims Act, or FCA, which imposes civil liability and criminal fines on individuals or entities that knowingly submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government. The FCA also allows private individuals to bring a suit on behalf of the government against an individual or entity for violations of the FCA. These suits, also known as qui tam actions, may be brought by, with only a few exceptions, any private citizen who believes that he has material information of a false claim that has not yet been previously disclosed. These suits have increased significantly in recent years because the FCA allows an individual to share in any amounts paid to the federal government in fines or settlement as a result of a successful qui tam action;\n\u2022federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any federal healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the government information related to payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d made to a \u201ccovered recipient,\u201d which include physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and beginning in 2022, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives following an expansion of the law by Congress in 2018. Applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations also must report annually ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members and payments or other \u201ctransfers of value\u201d to such physician owners and their immediate family members;\n\u2022the US federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes obligations on certain covered entity health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services; similar to the US federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022the US federal laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under federal health care programs;\n\u2022state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts;\n\u2022analogous state and foreign laws and regulations relating to health care fraud and abuse, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving health care items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; and\n\u2022state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal health care programs, and/or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment, or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results, action against\nus for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against them, it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nOur business activities may be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws of other countries in which we operate.\nWe have conducted and may in the future initiate additional studies in countries other than the United States. Our business activities may be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate. There is no certainty that all of our employees, agents or contractors, or those of our affiliates, will comply with all applicable laws and regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, the closing down of our facilities, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products, if approved, in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees and our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nHealthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs, and there continues to be significant uncertainty regarding health care, health care coverage and health care insurance markets. The uncertainty around the future of the Affordable Care Act, and in particular the impact to reimbursement levels, may lead to uncertainty or delay in the purchasing decisions of our customers, which may in turn negatively impact our product sales and results of operations. Similarly, there are a number of state and local legislative and regulatory efforts related to drug pricing, including drug price transparency laws that apply to pharmaceutical manufacturers, that may have an impact on our business. We expect that additional healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit reimbursement levels, which could result in reduced demand for our products or create additional pricing pressures.\nEven after our products receive regulatory approval, such products may not achieve expected levels of market acceptance.\nEven if we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for our generic pharmaceutical products the success of those products is dependent upon market acceptance. Levels of market acceptance for our products could be impacted by several factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022the availability of alternative products from our competitors;\n\u2022the price of our products relative to that of our competitors;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our marketing relative to that of our competitors;\n\u2022the timing of our market entry;\n\u2022the ability to market our products effectively to the different levels in the distribution chain;\n\u2022other competitor actions; and\n\u2022the continued acceptance of and/or reimbursement for our products by government and private formularies and/or third party payors.\nAdditionally, studies of the proper utilization, safety, and efficacy of pharmaceutical products conducted by the industry, government agencies, and others can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed as well as future products. In some cases, studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of product marketing or other risk management programs, such as the need for a patient registry, as well as delays in approvals. The occurrence of any of the above risks could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flow.\nProduct recalls could harm our business.\nProduct recalls or product field alerts may be issued at our discretion or required by the FDA and Health Canada, other governmental agencies or other companies having regulatory authority for pharmaceutical product sales. From time to time, we may recall products for various reasons, including failure of our products to maintain their stability through their expiration dates or other quality issues. Any recall or product field alert has the potential of damaging our reputation or the reputation of the product. Any significant recalls could materially affect our sales. In these cases, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are susceptible to product liability claims that may not be covered by insurance and could require us to pay substantial sums.\nWe face the risk of loss resulting from, and adverse publicity and reputational harm associated with, product liability lawsuits, whether or not such claims are valid. We may not be able to avoid such claims. In addition, our product liability insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims and we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs. A successful product liability claim that exceeds our policy limits could require us to pay substantial sums. In addition, product liability coverage for pharmaceutical companies is becoming more expensive and increasingly difficult to obtain and, as a result, we may not be able to obtain the type and amount of coverage we desire or to maintain our current coverage.\nThe testing required for the regulatory approval of our products is conducted by independent third parties.\nOur applications for the regulatory approval of our products incorporate the results of testing and other information that is conducted or gathered by independent third parties (including, for example, manufacturers of raw materials, testing laboratories, CROs or independent research facilities). Our ability to obtain regulatory approval of the products being tested is dependent upon the quality of the work performed by these third parties, the quality of the third parties\u2019 facilities, and the accuracy of the information provided to us by third parties. We have little or no control over any of these factors. If this testing is not performed properly, our ability to obtain regulatory approvals could be restricted or delayed. In addition, if third party fraud or other recordkeeping problems are discovered after our products are approved for marketing, any government investigations or findings could result in any products that incorporated those fraudulent results having their regulatory approvals withdrawn. The recent COVID-19 pandemic may create additional risk and delays at our independent third party service providers.\nOur product offerings and our customers\u2019 products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nFrom time to time, third parties have asserted intellectual property infringement claims against us and our customers and there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against either us or our customers in the future. While we believe that our products do not infringe in any material respect upon proprietary rights of other parties and/or that meritorious defenses would exist with respect to any assertions to the contrary, there can be no assurance that we would not be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others. Any claims that our products or processes infringe these rights, regardless of their merit or resolutions, could be costly and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. We may not prevail in such proceedings given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation.\nIn addition, our customers\u2019 products may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which could materially affect our business if their products cease to be manufactured and they have to discontinue the use of the infringing technology which we may provide. Further, we may be responsible for indemnifying our customers for an intellectual property infringement claim.\nIf we were to assert any of our own intellectual property infringement claims against third parties and the third parties were found not to infringe our intellectual property or our intellectual property was found to be invalid and/or unenforceable, we would lose the opportunity to leverage our own intellectual property, for example, through licensing of our technology to others, collection of damages and/or royalty payments based upon successful assertion of our intellectual property rights via enjoining others from practicing the technology at issue.\nAny of the foregoing could affect our ability to compete or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur goodwill or other intangible assets have been subject to impairment charges and may continue to be subject to impairment in the future.\nWe assess the recoverability of our long-lived assets, which include property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, annually or whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. Impairment may result from various factors, including adverse changes in assumptions used for valuation purposes, such as actual or projected revenue growth rates, profitability, or discount rates. If indicators of impairment exist, projected future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to its carrying amount to determine whether the asset\u2019s value is recoverable. Any resulting impairment is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset in excess of fair value and a charge to operating results. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we determined that there was an impairment of $101.5 million to our long-lived assets, and we may experience such charges in the future, particularly if our business performance continues to decline or expected growth is not realized. We cannot predict the amount and timing of any future impairments, if\nany. Any future impairment of our goodwill, tangible assets or other intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the trading price of our securities.\nWe may become involved in legal proceedings from time to time which may result in losses, damage to our business and reputation and place a strain on our internal resources.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may be involved in legal proceedings with both private parties and certain government agencies, including the FDA. Enforcement actions and litigation may result in verdicts against us, which may include significant monetary awards, judgments that certain of our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable and injunctions preventing the manufacture, marketing and sale of our products. If disputes are resolved unfavorably, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Any government enforcement action or litigation, whether or not successful, may damage our reputation. Furthermore, we are likely to incur substantial expense in defending these actions and lawsuits, and the time demands of such enforcement actions and lawsuits could divert management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns and interfere with our normal operations.\nIn the normal course of business, we periodically enter into employment agreements, legal settlements, and other agreements which incorporate indemnification provisions. We maintain insurance coverage which we believe will effectively mitigate our obligations under these indemnification provisions. However, should our obligation under an indemnification provision exceed our coverage or should coverage be denied, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe are currently involved in U.S. and Canadian antitrust litigation related to our pricing practices, each of which could result in significant fines, reputational harm or otherwise adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThirteen putative class actions have been filed against us and certain other defendants and have been consolidated in Multidistrict Litigation in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania regarding the pricing of generic pharmaceuticals, including our antifungal skin cream Econazole Nitrate 1% product. In addition, \u201cOpt-out\u201d antitrust lawsuits have been filed against us by various plaintiffs and have been consolidated into the Multidistrict Litigation. Each of the opt-out complaints names several dozen defendants (including us) and involves allegations regarding the pricing of econazole (and in some cases fluocinolone acetonide) along with up to 180 other drug products, most of which were not manufactured or sold by us during the period at issue. A complaint has also been filed by certain state Attorneys General based on pricing of topical drugs, naming us as a defendant with respect to econazole nitrate. This action has also been consolidated into the Multidistrict Litigation. In addition, in June 2020, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the Federal Court of Canada against us and our Canadian subsidiary, along with over 50 other pharmaceutical defendant companies, alleging that the generic drug manufacturer defendants conspired to allocate the Canadian market and customers, fix prices and maintain the supply of generic drugs in Canada to artificially maintain market share and higher generic drug prices in violation of Canada\u2019s Competition Act. The Canadian lawsuit is at a very early stage and we are unable to form a judgment at this time as to whether an unfavorable outcome is probable or remote to provide an estimate of the amount or range of potential loss. While we intend to vigorously defend our position in connection with each of these lawsuits, the outcome of any of this litigation could result in serious fines being levied on us, along with harm to our reputation. Any negative outcome from any of these matters or any other investigation related to our pricing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Any system failure, accident or security breach that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we may incur liability and the further development of our product candidates may be delayed.\nIn addition, we rely on complex information technology systems, including Internet-based systems, to support our supply chain processes as well as internal and external communications. The size and complexity of our systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown or interruption, whether due to computer viruses or other causes that may result in the loss of key information or the impairment of production and other supply chain processes. Such disruptions and breaches of security could adversely affect our business.\nEconomic conditions could severely impact us.\nCurrent economic conditions may cause a decline in business and consumer spending which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Our business and financial performance, including collection of our accounts receivable, realization of inventory, recoverability of assets including investments, may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions, such as a reduction in the availability of credit, financial market volatility and recession.\nIf we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow or maintain our business may be harmed.\nWe will need to hire or retain qualified personnel with expertise in quality systems, nonclinical testing, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing, sales and marketing and finance. We compete for qualified individuals with numerous pharmaceutical and consumer products companies, universities and other research institutions. Competition for such individuals is intense, and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success.\nIf we fail to comply with the reporting obligations of the Exchange Act and Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or if we fail to achieve and maintain adequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, our business results of operations and financial condition, and investors\u2019 confidence in us, could be materially adversely affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the periodic reporting obligations of the Exchange Act including preparing annual reports, quarterly reports and current reports. We did not timely file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, which quarterly report was filed on December 31, 2020. Our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws, expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing.\nIn addition, we are required under applicable law and regulations to integrate our systems of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Our management assessed our existing disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020, and our management concluded that we did not maintain effective control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. For a detailed description of these material weaknesses, see Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures\" below.\nOur remediation efforts identified in Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d below are ongoing and we continue our initiatives to implement and document policies, procedures, and internal controls. Remediation of the identified material weaknesses and strengthening our internal control environment will require a substantial effort throughout 2021 and beyond, as necessary.\nIf we are unsuccessful in implementing or following our remediation plan, or fail to update our internal control over financial reporting as our business evolves, or if additional material weaknesses are found in our internal controls in the future, we may not be able to timely or accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures. If we are unable to report financial information in a timely and accurate manner or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, we could be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC, an inability for us to be accepted for listing on any national securities exchange in the near future, securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects and the market value of our Common Stock. Further, there are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. We could face additional litigation exposure and a greater likelihood of an SEC enforcement or other regulatory action if further restatements were to occur or other accounting-related problems emerge. In addition, any future restatements or other accounting-related problems may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur past failure to prepare and timely file our periodic report with the SEC may limit our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital.\nSince we did not file a prior periodic report within the timeframe required by the SEC, we are not currently eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 that would allow us to continuously incorporate by reference our SEC reports into the registration statement, or to use \u201cshelf\u201d registration statements to conduct offerings, until approximately one year from the date we regained and maintain status as a current and timely filer. If we wish to pursue an equity or debt offering within the next year, we would be required to conduct the offering on an exempt basis, such as in accordance with Rule 144A, or file a registration statement on Form S-1. Using a Form S-1 registration statement for a public offering would likely take significantly longer than using a registration statement on Form S-3 and increase our transaction costs, and could, to the extent we are not able to conduct offerings using alternative methods, adversely impact our liquidity or ability to raise capital in a timely manner.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal net operating loss carry forwards, or NOLs, of approximately $10.7 million which expire from 2021 through 2037. Federal operating losses arising during and after 2018 are not subject to expiration; however, their usage except for losses incurred in the years 2018 through 2020 is limited to 80% of taxable income during the year of use assuming that they qualify for use under the CARES Act. Our ability to utilize our NOLs is limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Our ability to use NOLs is subject to substantial limitation in future periods under certain provisions of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which limit the utilization of net operating losses upon a more than 50% change in ownership of our stock that is held by 5% or greater stockholders. We examined the application of Section 382 with respect to an ownership change that took place during 2010, as well as the limitation on the application of net operating loss carry forwards. We believe that operating losses subsequent to the change date in 2010 (aggregating $26.5 million) are not subject to Section 382 limitations unless additional ownership changes occur. We reexamined the application of Section 382 for years after 2010 and discovered that changes in ownership occurred on August 19, 2020, October 31, 2020 and December 31, 2020. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, we estimated an annual limitation of $28 thousand per year. The Company has also estimated the amounts of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards which will expire unutilized as a result of its estimated annual limitations under Section 382 and has made the decision to write them down, detail of which is in the tax footnote. Finally, future use of the NOLs can be limited again if the Company has any additional changes in ownership under Section 382.\nWe are subject to the provisions of ASC 740-10-25, Income Taxes (ASC 740) which prescribes a more likely-than-not threshold for the financial statement recognition of uncertain tax positions. ASC 740 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. On a quarterly basis, we undergo a process to evaluate whether income tax accruals are in accordance with ASC 740 guidance on uncertain tax positions. For federal purposes, post 1998 tax years remain open to examination as a result of NOLs. We are currently open to audit by the appropriate state income taxing authorities for tax years 2016 to 2019. Currently, we are under audit by the state of New Jersey for the period 2015 to 2020.\nFor the tax year ended December 31 2020, we have recorded an unrecognized tax benefit of $2.3 million.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial level of indebtedness and our current liquidity constraints could adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows and our ability to service our indebtedness.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness which will require significant cash to service. As of the date of this Form 10-K filing and after giving effect to the January 2021 Debt Exchange Transactions, our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $109.7 million. Our substantial level of indebtedness, coupled with our expectation that we will continue to incur losses and generate negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future, makes it unlikely that we will be able to generate sufficient cash to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on, or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness, combined with our significant liquidity constraints and other financial obligations and contractual commitments, may have a material adverse impact on us.\nTo the extent we incur new indebtedness, the related risks we now face regarding our substantial leverage could be intensified. Further, our ability to meet our expenses, to remain in compliance with our covenants under our debt instruments and to make future payments in respect of our indebtedness depends on, among other factors, our operating performance, competitive developments and financial market conditions, all of which are significantly affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We are not able to control many of these factors. Given current industry and economic conditions, our cash flow may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. If we fail to meet our obligations under our existing or future indebtedness and the lenders declare one or more events of default thereunder, you will suffer a total loss of your investment in our common stock, whether through pursuit of a reorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, foreclosure or otherwise.\nIf we fail to comply with the financial covenants contained in our Senior Credit Facilities, our senior lenders could accelerate all amounts owing thereunder which, in turn, could result in the acceleration of all amounts owing under our Series D Notes.\nWe are subject to certain financial covenants as set forth in our Senior Credit Facilities. These financial covenants include a minimum liquidity covenant of $3.0 million (on a consolidated basis) at all times, which increases to $4.0 million (on a consolidated basis) on March 31, 2022. In addition, until March 31, 2022, the Senior Credit Facilities suspend testing of the minimum consolidated adjusted EBITDA covenant, at which time such minimum consolidated adjusted EBITDA covenant levels will resume to the levels in effect prior to the Second Lien Amendment. In the event that we are unable to comply with these covenants, or obtain a waiver from our senior lenders, the senior lenders would have the right, but not the obligation, to permanently reduce the commitments under the Senior Credit Facilities in whole or in part or to declare all or any portion of the outstanding balances thereunder due and payable. We do not currently have available liquidity to repay these outstanding borrowings in the event of a default and acceleration. If we are unable to raise additional capital to meet these obligations, we may have to delay expenditures, reduce the scope of our manufacturing operations, reduce or eliminate one or more of our development programs, make significant changes to our operating plan, pursue a merger or other transaction involving a change of control, restructure our outstanding debt, or seek relief under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nRestrictive covenants in our Senior Credit Facilities may interfere with our ability to obtain additional advances under existing credit facilities or to obtain new financing or to engage in other business activities.\nOur Senior Credit Facilities contain certain affirmative, negative, and financial covenants, including cross-defaults on other material indebtedness, as well as events of default triggered by a change of control and certain actions initiated by the FDA. These restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain additional advances under our credit facilities or to obtain new financing or to engage in other business activities, which may inhibit our ability to grow our business and increase revenue.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have recently experienced significant liquidity issues, and we continue to experience significant financial and operating challenges that present substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. As of the date of this Form 10-K filing, we had approximately $25.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. We have incurred significant losses and generated negative cash flows from operations in recent years, and we expect to continue to incur losses and generate negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future. We are not currently generating revenues from operations that are sufficient to cover our operating expenses, and our available capital resources are not sufficient for us to continue to meet our obligations as they become due, presenting substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe are actively exploring additional sources of liquidity and we have engaged financial and legal advisors to assist us in, among other matters, analyzing all available strategic alternatives to address our liquidity and capital structure including, but not limited to, significant changes in our operating plan, pursuit of a merger or other change of control transaction, restructuring our outstanding debt via out of court methods. Should the company\u2019s liquidity drop below acceptable operating limits, we may also pursue additional options including a reorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, or ceasing operations. However, we are unable to determine at this time whether any of these potential sources of liquidity will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, or if any such sources of liquidity, individually or taken together, will be sufficient to address our liquidity needs. There is substantial doubt that these potential sources of liquidity will be realized or that they will be sufficient to generate the material amounts of additional liquidity we will require to fund our operations for the foreseeable future.\nIn the event we were to pursue an in-court bankruptcy reorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, we would be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy proceedings, including the potential delisting of our common stock from trading on Nasdaq.\nWhile our recent equitization and refinancing transactions and our at-the-market equity offering have reduced our leverage and increased our cash and cash equivalents to approximately $25.2 million as of the date of this Form 10-K filing, we nonetheless continue to experience significant financial and operating challenges that present substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We expect to continue to explore and pursue other strategic cash raising options to address our liquidity issues. If we continue to experience financial and operating challenges or are unsuccessful in raising additional capital, there is risk that it will be necessary for us to commence in-court reorganization proceedings. In the event we were to pursue such a restructuring, our operations, our ability to develop and execute our business plan and our continuation as a going concern would be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy proceedings, including, among others: the high costs of bankruptcy proceedings and related fees; our ability to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market; our ability to obtain sufficient financing to allow us to emerge from bankruptcy and execute our business plan post-emergence, and our ability to comply with terms and conditions of that financing; our ability to maintain our relationships with our lenders, counterparties, vendors, suppliers, employees and other third parties; our ability to maintain contracts that are\ncritical to our operations on reasonably acceptable terms and conditions; the ability of third parties to use certain limited safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to terminate contracts without first seeking bankruptcy court approval; and the actions and decisions of our existing noteholders and other third parties who have claims and/or interests in our bankruptcy proceedings that may be inconsistent with our operational and strategic plans. Any reorganization effected under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code will result in a total loss of your investment in our common stock.\nIn addition, if we were to commence bankruptcy proceedings, our shares of common stock would likely be delisted from trading on Nasdaq. Nasdaq rules provide that securities of a company that trades on Nasdaq may be delisted in the event that such company seeks bankruptcy protection. In response to a Chapter 11 filing, Nasdaq would likely issue a delisting letter immediately following such a filing. If Nasdaq were to issue such a letter, we would have the opportunity to appeal the determination during which time the delisting would be stayed, but if we did not appeal or otherwise were not successful in our appeal, our common stock would soon thereafter be delisted and our common stock could be traded in the over-the-counter markets. Any delisting of our common stock could result in a substantial decline in the value of our common stock including, among other reasons, for the reduced liquidity of our common stock.\nOur stock price is, and we expect it to remain, volatile and subject to wide fluctuations, which may make it difficult for stockholders to sell shares of common stock at or above the price for which they were acquired.\nOur stock price is, and we expect it to remain, volatile. In addition, the trading volume in our common stock has experienced significant swings and could cause significant price variations to occur. During the last two fiscal years, our stock price has closed at a low of $0.48 in November 2020 and a high of $18.70 in January 2019. The volatile price of our stock makes it difficult for investors to predict the value of their investment, to sell shares at a profit at any given time, or to plan purchases and sales in advance. A variety of factors may affect the market price of our common stock. These include, but are not limited, to:\n\u2022the substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u2022the expectation that we will continue to incur losses and generate negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future;\n\u2022our substantially limited available liquidity and capital resources to meet our obligations as they become due;\n\u2022the prospect that at some point in the future we may be forced to pursue a reorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code;\n\u2022the amounts outstanding in borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities which, as of the date of this Form 10-K filing, were approximately $102.9 million, and the potential we may experience one or more defaults or events of default under our Senior Credit Facilities;\n\u2022the ongoing impacts and developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the delays in production relating to the FDA Warning Letter, the FDA\u2019s significant reduction of on-site inspections during the COVID-19 pandemic and the product recalls, long-term production pauses, short-term clear path to market production pauses, and continued production with minor process corrections arising out of issues identified in connection with our review of matters related to the FDA Warning Letter;\n\u2022receipt or rejection of regulatory approvals by our competitors or us;\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by our competitors or us;\n\u2022developments concerning proprietary rights, including patents;\n\u2022developments concerning our collaborations;\n\u2022legislative, administrative, regulatory or other actions affecting our business or our industry, including positions taken by the FDA, the Internal Revenue Service or other governmental or quasi-governmental agencies;\n\u2022anticipated or pending investigations, proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us;\n\u2022economic or other crises in the markets in which we compete, and other external factors;\n\u2022stock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies and, in particular, those that are in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical and consumer products industry;\n\u2022actual or anticipated sales of our common stock, including sales by our directors, officers or significant stockholders;\n\u2022additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022period-to-period fluctuations in our revenues and other results of operations;\n\u2022speculation about our business in the press or the investment community;\n\u2022the occurrence of any of the other risk factors included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement; and\n\u2022global and domestic events such as natural disasters, pandemics or acts of terrorism or insurrection.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation, even if it does not result in liability for us, could result in substantial costs to us and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe Series D Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to dividends, distributions and liquidation. In addition, the conversion of our shares of Series D Preferred Stock could cause substantial dilution to the holders of shares of our common stock.\nThe Series D Preferred Stock ranks, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, senior to our common stock. The holders of Series D Preferred Stock are entitled to dividends on shares of Series D Preferred Stock equal (on an as-if-converted-to-common-stock basis) to and in the same form as dividends (other than dividends in the form of common stock) actually paid on shares of common stock when, as and if such dividends (other than dividends in the form of common stock) are paid on shares of common stock. No other dividends shall be paid on shares of Series D Preferred Stock and we are not permitted to pay any dividends (other than dividends in the form of common stock) on shares of common stock unless it simultaneously complies with the immediately preceding sentence.\nUpon the occurrence of a Corporation Sale (as defined below), we must redeem each share of Series D Preferred Stock by paying each holder of Series D Preferred Stock an amount equal to the amount such holder would have received in connection with such Corporation Sale had such holder converted such share of Series D Preferred Stock into common stock immediately prior to such Corporation Sale. Such payment must be made prior and in preference to any payments made on our common stock in respect of such Corporation Sale. A \u201cCorporation Sale\u201d means (i) our consolidation or merger with or into another entity or other corporate reorganization in which we are not the surviving entity (excluding any merger effected exclusively for the purpose of changing our domicile), (ii) a transaction or series of related transactions in which in excess of fifty percent (50%) of our voting power is transferred to a third party (or group of affiliated third parties), excluding a bona fide equity financing transaction, or (iii) a sale, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition (but not including a transfer or disposition by pledge or mortgage to a bona fide lender) of all or substantially all of our assets.\nAdditionally, each share of Series D Preferred Stock is convertible into 200 shares of common stock as follows: (i) at any time and from time to time to the extent that the aggregate number of shares of common stock to be issued upon such conversion is less than or equal to the number of authorized shares of common stock available for issuance and not reserved or set aside for other purposes and (ii) at any time and from time to time, in full or in part, from and after stockholder approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock or a reverse split of our common stock to allow for full conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock is subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of stock dividends, stock splits or similar events affecting our common stock. Any conversion of shares of Series D Preferred Stock into shares of common stock may cause substantial dilution to the holders of our common stock, including purchasers of our common stock in connection with any offering.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nIn order to raise additional capital, we may need to continue to engage in additional financings in the future in order to cover our operating expenses and to otherwise meet our obligations as they come due. While there can be no assurances that any such future financings will ever be completed, they would likely involve significant additional dilution of the interests of our stockholders upon the issuance of convertible debt instruments, common stock or other securities. Attaining such additional financing may not be possible, or if additional capital may be otherwise available, the terms on which such capital may be available may not be commercially feasible or advantageous to investors participating in such offering, including in respect of our current inability to utilize a shelf registration statement on Form S-3.\nShares of our common stock can be relatively illiquid which may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nAs a result of our relatively small public float, our common stock may be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership. Among other things, trading of a relatively small volume of our common stock may have a greater impact on the trading price for our shares than would be the case if our public float were larger. The recent COVID-19 pandemic may cause increased risk to our common stock\u2019s liquidity and trading price.\nOur principal stockholders own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over our affairs.\nOur principal stockholders own in the aggregate a significant portion of our capital stock. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, would be able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an\nopportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nDue to the concentration of common stock owned by significant stockholders, the sale of such stock might adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nOur largest stockholders own shares of common stock that are subject to registration rights or that are otherwise eligible for resale under the Securities Act. The sale of such stock, depending on the interplay of numerous factors, including, without limitation, the method and timing of the sales, could substantially depress the value of our common stock. If such stockholders sold a significant amount of stock it could have an adverse effect on the price of the stock.\nWe have not paid dividends to our common stockholders in the past nor do we expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, and any return on investment may be limited to potential future appreciation on the value of our common stock.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings to support the development and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including without limitation, our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be a party to at the time. To the extent we do not pay dividends, our stock may be less valuable because a return on investment will only occur if and to the extent our stock price appreciates, which may never occur. In addition, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize their investment, and if the price of our stock does not appreciate, then there will be no return on investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.", "PERMNO": 43634, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "TLGT"}
