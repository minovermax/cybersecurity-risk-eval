Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that our management currently deems immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the risks described below were to occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In such an event, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks and uncertainties, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and\nuncertainties discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. See Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Forward-Looking Statements.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a limited operating history and have incurred significant losses to date, anticipate continuing to incur losses and may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe are an emerging growth company with a limited operating history. We only recently began commercializing our products. To date, a substantial portion of our revenues has consisted of funding from third party collaborative research agreements and government grants. We have generated only limited revenues from commercial sales, the majority of which have been derived from sales of our skin and personal care products through our Algenist business, which we sold to a third party in August 2016. We expect a significant portion of our future revenues to come from commercial sales in food, including aquaculture, nutrition, and specialty personal care ingredients.\nWe have incurred substantial net losses since our inception, including a net loss of $101.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. We expect these losses may continue as we ramp up our manufacturing capacity and build out our product pipeline. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $711.5 million. We expect to incur additional costs and expenses related to the continued development and expansion of our business, including research and development, the operation of our Peoria production facility, the ramp up and operation of the Solazyme Bunge Produtos Renov\u00e1veis Ltda. (SB Oils) production facility (described below) and, potentially, other commercial facilities. As a result, our annual and quarterly operating losses may continue.\nIn April 2012, we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with Bunge Global Innovation and certain of its affiliates (Bunge), forming Solazyme Bunge Renewable Oils Co\u00f6peratief U.A. (SB Oils JV) which wholly owns Solazyme Bunge Produtos Renov\u00e1veis Ltda., which is doing business as SB Oils. We, along with our development and commercialization partners, will need to develop products successfully, cost effectively produce them in large quantities, and market and sell them profitably. If we fail to become profitable, or if we are unable to fund our continuing losses, we may be unable to continue our business operations. There can be no assurance that we will ever achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has included a going concern uncertainty explanatory paragraph in its Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm issued to us in connection with this 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business has not been generating sufficient cash flow from operations, and funds may not be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs, and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. We may not be able to raise sufficient additional funds on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. If we fail to raise adequate funds and continue to incur losses, we will not be able to fund our operations or continue our business as a going concern. For additional information, see Note 3 - Going Concern Uncertainty - of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe expect to require additional financing in the future and may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms, if at all, which could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development or commercialization activities.\nTo date, we have financed our operations primarily through our initial public offering, completed in June 2011, public and private placements of our equity and convertible debt securities, credit facilities, government grants and funding from strategic partners. In January 2013 we issued $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due 2018 (the 2018 Notes). The 2018 Notes bear interest at a rate of 6.00% per year, payable in cash semi-annually. In April 2014 we issued 5,750,000 shares of our common stock and $149.5 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due 2019 (the 2019 Notes). The 2019 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.00% per year, payable in cash semi-annually. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $32.5 million aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes was outstanding and approximately $148.1 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes was outstanding. In March 2016, we issued $27,850,000 aggregate principal amount of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The terms of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are described in Note 13 in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, we also entered into a loan and security agreement with SVB that provides for a $12.9 million letter of credit facility and supports the standby letter of credit issued by Silicon Valley Bank in April 2016 (SVB SLOC) in favor of Ita\u00fa Unibanco S.A (Ita\u00fa) in connection with the loan agreement entered into by SB Oils and the Brazilian Development Bank in February 2013 (JV BNDES Loan.)\nWe have sought to raise funds and to refinance our convertible notes but have been unsuccessful in such efforts to date. If we fail to do so, we may not be able to continue our operations as a going concern.\nSome of our previous funding has come from government grants; however, our future ability to obtain government grants is uncertain due to the competitive bid process and other factors. In addition, we expect to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings to meet our capital requirements, including our portion of joint venture funding requirements. For example, if SB Oils needs and is unable to secure additional financing, we will be required to fund our portion of SB Oils' capital requirements from existing sources or seek additional financing. In addition, our working capital requirements and the working capital requirements of SB Oils may increase as we and SB Oils each increase production due to an increase in inventory and the manufacture of out-of-specification product during the ramp-up of commercial production. Furthermore, Bunge has been providing working capital to SB Oils through a revolving loan facility that matures on April 2, 2017. If Bunge does not extend the maturity date of the revolving loan facility, then SB Oils would need to find alternative sources of financing. SB Oils may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms, or at all, which may lead to increased equity investments in the SB Oils JV by TerraVia and Bunge.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has included a going concern uncertainty explanatory paragraph in its Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm issued to us in connection with this 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business has not been generating sufficient cash flow from operations, and funds may not be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs, and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. We may not be able to raise sufficient additional funds on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. If we fail to raise adequate funds and continue to incur losses, we will not be able to fund our operations or continue our business as a going concern. For additional information, see Note 3 - Going Concern Uncertainty - of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay amounts due under our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total consolidated indebtedness was $180.6 million. Of our $180.6 million of indebtedness, none is currently secured. We ended 2016 with a cash and marketable securities balance of $64.0 million. The 2019 Notes mature on October 1, 2019 and the 2018 Notes mature on February 1, 2018. We also may be required to provide a corporate guarantee with respect to the portion of the JV BNDES loan that, when added to our bank guarantee, does not exceed our percentage ownership in the SB Oils JV.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the 2018 Notes and the 2019 Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nWe have generated limited revenues from the sale of our products, and our business may fail if we are not able to successfully commercialize these products.\nWe have had only limited product revenues to date, with historic positive gross margins principally derived from the commercial sale of skin and personal care products through our Algenist business, which we sold to a third party in August 2016, and negative gross margins on certain other commercial product sales. Sales of our ingredients and other products have not historically generated positive gross margins. If we are not successful in replacing sales of Algenist products with sales of our other products at acceptable prices, further advancing our existing commercial arrangements with strategic partners, developing new arrangements, ramping up or otherwise increasing our manufacturing capacity and securing reliable access to sufficient volumes of low-cost feedstock, we will be unable to generate meaningful revenues from our products. We are subject to the substantial risk of failure facing businesses seeking to develop products based on a new technology.\nCertain factors that could, alone or in combination, prevent us from successfully commercializing our products include:\n\u2022\nour ability to secure reliable access to sufficient volumes of low-cost feedstock;\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve commercial-scale production of our products on a cost-effective basis and in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nour ability to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and continue as a going concern;\n\u2022\nour ability to secure consistent and reliable supplies of power and steam for production facilities;\n\u2022\ntechnical or operational challenges with our manufacturing processes or with development, scaling up or ramping production of new products that we are not able to overcome;\n\u2022\nour ability to consistently manufacture our products within specifications;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain successful relationships with development, feedstock, manufacturing and commercialization partners;\n\u2022\nour ability to gain market acceptance of our products with customers and maintain customer relationships;\n\u2022\nour ability to sell our products at an acceptable price;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage our growth;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet applicable regulatory requirements for the production, distribution and sale of our products and to comply with applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nactions of direct and indirect competitors that may seek to enter the markets in which we expect to compete or that may seek to impose barriers to one or more markets that we intend to target; and\n\u2022\npublic concerns about the ethical, legal, environmental and social ramifications of the use of targeted recombinant technology, land use and the potential diversion of resources from food production.\nThe production of our microalgae-based products requires fermentable feedstock. The inability to obtain feedstock in sufficient quantities or in a timely and cost-effective manner may limit our ability to produce our products.\nA critical component of the production of our microalgae-based products is access to feedstock in sufficient quantities and at an acceptable price to enable commercial production and sale. Other than as described below, we currently purchase feedstock, such as sugarcane-based sucrose and corn-based dextrose, for the production of our products at prevailing market prices.\nWe do not have any long-term supply agreements or other guaranteed access to feedstock other than for the supply of feedstock to SB Oils by our partner, Bunge, pursuant to our joint venture arrangement that includes a feedstock supply agreement. As we scale our production, we anticipate that the production of our microalgae-based products will require large volumes of feedstock, and we may not be able to contract with feedstock producers to secure sufficient quantities of feedstock at reasonable costs or at all. For example, sugarcane-based sucrose for the SB Oils production facility in Moema, Brazil is being provided by Bunge. Sugar and corn are traded as commodities and are subject to price volatility. While we may seek to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the price of sugar and corn-based dextrose by entering into hedging transactions directly or through our joint venture arrangement, we may not be successful in doing so. If we cannot access feedstock in the quantities we need at acceptable prices, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our food ingredients, including aquaculture, specialty personal care products and other products, and our business will suffer. If we do not succeed in entering into long-term supply contracts when necessary or successfully hedge against our exposure to fluctuations in the price of feedstock, our costs and profit margins may fluctuate from period to period as we will remain subject to prevailing market prices.\nAlthough our plan is to enter into partnerships, such as the SB Oils JV, with feedstock providers to supply the feedstock necessary to produce our products, we cannot predict the future availability or price of such feedstock or be sure that our feedstock partners will be able to supply such feedstock in sufficient quantities or in a timely manner. The prices of feedstock depend on numerous factors outside of our or our partners\u2019 control, including weather conditions, government programs and regulations, changes in global demand, rising or falling commodities and equities markets, and availability of credit to producers. Crop yields and sugar content depend on weather conditions such as rainfall and temperature. Variable weather conditions have historically caused volatility in feedstock crop prices due to crop failures or reduced harvests. For example, excessive rainfall can adversely affect the supply of feedstock available for the production of our products by reducing the sucrose content of feedstock and limiting growers\u2019 ability to harvest. Crop disease and pestilence can also occur from time to time and can adversely affect feedstock crop growth, potentially rendering useless or unusable all or a substantial portion of affected harvests. The limited amount of time during which feedstock crops keep their sugar content after harvest poses a risk of spoilage. Also, the fact that many feedstock crops are not themselves traded commodities limits our ability to substitute supply in the event of such an occurrence. If our ability to obtain feedstock crops is adversely affected by these or other conditions, our ability to produce our products will be impaired, and our business will be adversely affected. In the near term we believe Brazilian sugarcane-based sucrose will be an important feedstock for us. Along with the risks described above, Brazilian sugarcane prices may also increase due to, among other things, changes in the criteria set by the Conselho dos\nProdutores de Cana, A\u00e7\u00facar e \u00c1lcool (Council of Sugarcane, Sugar and Ethanol Producers), known as Consecana. Consecana is an industry association of producers of sugarcane, sugar and ethanol that sets market terms and prices for general supply, lease and partnership agreements and may change such prices and terms from time to time. Moreover, Brazil has a developed industry for producing ethanol from sugarcane, and if we have manufacturing operations in Brazil that do not have a partner providing the sugarcane feedstock, such as Bunge as part of the SB Oils JV, we will need to compete for sugarcane feedstock with ethanol producers. Such changes and competition could result in higher sugarcane prices and/or a significant decrease in the volume of sugarcane available for the production of our products, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have entered into joint venture arrangements with Bunge to produce microalgae-based products in Brazil using Bunge's sugarcane feedstock, and if we are not able to successfully execute our strategy under these arrangements in a timely manner, or at all, our business will be adversely affected.\nSB Oils produces microalgae-based products in Brazil using our proprietary technology and sugarcane feedstock provided by Bunge. SB Oils' production facility is located adjacent to a sugarcane processing mill in Brazil that is owned by Bunge. SB Oils purchased the facility site from Bunge. The purchase of any additional land by SB Oils would be complex, subject to multiple approvals from governmental authorities and take time to complete. The construction of SB Oils' production facility began in June 2012, and the first commercial product from the SB Oils production facility was produced in the second quarter of 2014. Manufacturing operations and processes continue to be optimized as the facility is ramped up. In addition, we have entered into a series of research and development agreements with Bunge and with SB Oils to, among other things, develop additional products for SB Oils. The current funded projects extend through December 2018.\nDue to the termination of certain contracts relating to third party manufacturing facilities in the United States, some customers that previously had received our products from such facilities may need to qualify products that are now to be produced at the SB Oils production facility. A failure by the products manufactured at the SB Oils production facility to qualify or otherwise meet the requirements of our customers would adversely affect our business.\nOur pursuit of new product opportunities may not be technologically feasible or cost effective, which would limit our ability to expand our product line and sources of revenues.\nWe have committed, and intend to continue to commit, substantial resources, alone or with collaboration partners, to the development and analysis of new oils and other microalgae-based products by applying classical and recombinant technology to our microalgae strains. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in creating new oil profiles, or other microalgae-based products, that we, our customers, our partners or their customers desire. There are significant technological hurdles in successfully applying recombinant and other technology to microalgae, and if we are unsuccessful at developing microalgae strains that produce desirable oils and other microalgae-based products, the number and size of the markets we will be able to address will be limited, our expected profit margins could be reduced and the potential profitability of our business could be compromised.\nThe successful development of our business depends on our ability to efficiently and cost-effectively produce microalgae-based products at large commercial scale.\nTwo of the significant drivers of our production costs are the level of productivity and conversion yield of our microalgae strains. For example, with respect to oil, productivity is principally a function of the amount of oil that can be obtained from a given volume over a particular time period. Conversion yield refers to the amount of the desired oil that can be produced from a fixed amount of feedstock. We may not be able to meet our currently expected production cost profile as we ramp up large commercial manufacturing facilities. If we cannot do so, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nProduction of both current and future oils and other microalgae-based products will require that our technology and processes be scalable from laboratory, pilot and demonstration projects to large commercial-scale production. We have limited experience constructing, ramping up or managing large, commercial-scale manufacturing facilities. We may not have identified all of the factors that could affect our manufacturing processes. Our technology may not perform as expected when applied at large commercial scale, or we may encounter operational challenges for which we are unable to identify a workable solution. For example, contamination in the production process, equipment failure or accidents, problems with consistent and reliable plant utilities, human error, issues arising from process modifications to reduce costs and adjust product specifications, and other similar challenges could decrease process efficiency, create delays and increase our costs. To date we have employed our technology using fermenters with a capacity of up to approximately 625,000 liters. However, we still need to demonstrate that we can reach our target cost structure, including the achievement of target yields and productivities at approximately 625,000 liter scale in Brazil. We may not be able to scale up our production in a timely manner, on commercially reasonable terms, or at\nall. If we are unable to manufacture products at a large commercial scale, our ability to commercialize our technology will be adversely affected, and, with respect to any products that we do bring to market, we may not be able to achieve and maintain an acceptable production cost profile, which would adversely affect our ability to reach, maintain and increase the profitability of our business.\nWe rely in part on third parties for the production and processing of our products. If these parties do not produce and process our products at a satisfactory quality, in a timely manner, in sufficient quantities and at an acceptable cost, our development and commercialization efforts could be delayed or otherwise negatively impacted.\nOther than our Peoria production facility, we do not wholly own facilities that can produce and process our products other than at small scale. As such, we rely, and we expect to continue to rely, at least partially, on third parties (including partners and contract manufacturers) for the production and processing of our products. We currently have only one manufacturing arrangement for large-scale commercial fermentation: an agreement for the manufacture of certain products by SB Oils pursuant to a joint venture arrangement. We also have the ability to do smaller-scale commercial fermentation at our Peoria production facility.\nIn addition, we have manufacturing agreements relating to other aspects of our production process. Our current and anticipated future dependence upon our partners and contract manufacturers for the production and processing of our products may adversely affect our ability to develop products on a timely and competitive basis. The failure of any of our counterparties, including SB Oils, to provide acceptable products at required volumes could delay the development and commercialization of our products or disrupt our operations or the operations of SB Oils. We or our partners will need to enter into additional agreements for the commercial development, manufacturing and sale of our products. There can be no assurance that we or our partners can do so on favorable terms, if at all. Even if we reach agreements with manufacturing partners to produce and process our products, initially the partners will be unfamiliar with our technology and production processes. We cannot be sure that the partners will have or develop the operational expertise needed to run the equipment and processes required to manufacture our products. Further, we may have limited control over the amount or timing of resources that any partner is able or willing to devote to production and processing of our products.\nTo date, our products have been produced and processed in quantities sufficient for our development work and initial commercial sales. Even if there is demand for our products at commercial scale, we or our partners may not be able to successfully increase the production capacity for any of our products in a timely or economic manner or at all. In addition, to the extent we are relying on contract manufacturers to produce and process our products, we cannot be sure that such contract manufacturers will have capacity available when we need their services, that they will be willing to dedicate a portion of their production and/or processing capacity to our products or that we will be able to reach acceptable price and other terms with them for the provision of their production and/or processing services. If we, our partners or our contract manufacturers are unable to increase the production capacity for a product when and as needed, the commercial launch of that product may be delayed, or there may be a shortage of supply, which could limit sales, cause us to lose customers and sales opportunities and impair the growth of our business.\nIn addition, if a production facility or the equipment in a production facility that produces and/or processes our products is significantly damaged, destroyed or otherwise becomes unavailable, we or our partners may be unable to replace the manufacturing capacity quickly or cost effectively. The inability to enter into manufacturing agreements, the damage or destruction of a production facility upon which we or our partners rely for manufacturing or any other delays in obtaining supply would delay or prevent us and/or our partners from further developing and commercializing our products.\nWe may experience significant delays and/or cost overruns in financing, designing, constructing and ramping up large commercial manufacturing facilities, which could result in harm to our business and prospects.\nIn order to meet our financial requirements for manufacturing facilities, we may have to raise additional funds and may be unable to do so in a timely manner, in sufficient amounts and on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. If we fail to raise sufficient funds, our ability to ramp up the SB Oils production facility or construct additional manufacturing facilities could be significantly limited. If this happens, we may be forced to delay the commercialization of our products and we will not be able to successfully execute our business plan, which would harm our business.\nManufacturing operations have begun at the SB Oils production facility adjacent to Bunge\u2019s Moema sugarcane mill in Brazil. The first products from the SB Oils production facility were produced in the second quarter of 2014, and manufacturing operations at this facility are in the process of being optimized and ramped up. We do not expect this facility to reach target nameplate capacity in the near term as SB Oils continues to optimize manufacturing operations and focuses production on high margin products, and additional capital expenditures may be required to reach nameplate capacity depending on the product mix produced at the SB Oils production facility. Under the joint venture agreements, Bunge has agreed to provide feedstock as well as utility services to the SB Oils production facility. The production facility has experienced, and may continue to experience, intermittent interruptions of supply of power and steam from Bunge. Bunge and SB Oils have completed a number of power and steam improvement projects, including the construction of an electrical grid tie-in and the tie-in and activation of a second steam boiler. SB Oils continues to evaluate the performance of these projects and may take additional actions in the future to further improve power and steam reliability, if necessary. Without consistent and reliable supplies of power and steam to the production facility, production yields will be lower, the ramp up and optimization of the SB Oils production facility will be delayed, our costs will increase and our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nIn February 2013, SB Oils entered into the JV BNDES Loan for project financing. Funds borrowed under the loan agreement have supported the production facility in Brazil, including a portion of the construction costs of the facility. In April 2016, the SVB SLOC was issued in favor of Ita\u00fa to support a bank guarantee issued to BNDES by Ita\u00fa on our behalf in connection with the JV BNDES Loan. The SVB SLOC is supported by a $12.9 million letter of credit facility we entered into with Silicon Valley Bank in June 2016 (SVB Facility).\nIn addition to the bank guarantee, we may be required to provide a corporate guarantee of a portion of the JV BNDES Loan (in an amount that, when added to the amount supported by our bank guarantee, does not exceed our ownership percentage in the SB Oils JV). Negotiating the terms of the corporate guarantee documentation may take longer than anticipated and may contain terms that are not favorable to us. SB Oils may in the future seek additional financing and may not be able to raise sufficient additional funds on favorable terms, if at all. If SB Oils is unable to secure additional financing, we will be required to fund our portion of SB Oils' capital requirements either from existing sources or seek additional financing. SB Oils also purchased the facility site from Bunge. The purchase of any additional land by SB Oils would be complex, subject to multiple approvals of governmental authorities and take time to complete.\nWe may need to construct, or otherwise secure access to, and fund, additional capacity greater than what we currently have as we continue to commercialize our products. Some of our customers may ultimately require that we acquire access to additional production facilities in order to diversify our manufacturing base. In addition, we have limited experience in the management of manufacturing operations at large scale. We may not be successful in producing the amount and quality of oil or other microalgae-based products we anticipate in the production facilities and our results of operations may suffer as a result. We have limited experience producing our products at commercial scale, and we will not succeed if we cannot maintain or decrease our production costs and effectively scale our technology and manufacturing processes.\nWe face financial risk associated with ramping up production to reduce our per-unit production costs. To reduce per-unit production costs, we must increase production to achieve economies of scale. However, if we do not sell production output in a timely manner or in sufficient volumes at sufficient prices, our investment in production will harm our cash position and generate losses. Due to decreases in the prices of petroleum and certain plant oils, on which products competitive with our own depend, we have determined not to manufacture certain of our products because the production and sale of such products at a loss would adversely affect our business. Therefore, we expect the time required to ramp up the SB Oils production facility and to achieve positive cash flows at such facility will be more than we previously anticipated. Further delays would materially adversely affect our business.\nOur transition to a food, including aquaculture, nutrition and specialty ingredients company may not go as planned.\nIn 2016, changed our name from Solazyme, Inc. to TerraVia Holdings, Inc. and sold Algenist, our skin care business, to a third party. We are focusing on the commercialization of food ingredients, consumer food brands, animal nutrition and specialty personal care ingredients. In connection with this transition, we plan to reallocate capital and management attention away from activities in industrial products, including fuels, chemicals and oil field services, and we are currently seeking strategic alternatives with respect to these businesses. We may not succeed in finding a strategic alternative that we believe appropriately values these businesses. We and our management may spend more resources than anticipated in evaluating strategic alternatives or continuing these businesses, which could negatively impact our overall business. Moreover, the minority interest we have in the Algenist business, which may not be successful, may lose some or all of its value.\nIf we fail to maintain and successfully manage our existing, or enter into new, strategic collaborations, we may not be able to develop and commercialize many of our products and achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur ability to enter into, maintain and manage collaborations in our target markets is important to the success of our business. We currently have joint venture, research and development, supply and/or distribution agreements with various strategic partners. We currently rely on our partners, in part, for manufacturing, sales and marketing services and intend to continue to do so for the foreseeable future, and we intend to enter into other strategic collaborations to produce, market and sell other products we develop. However, we may not be successful in entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties for the production, sale and marketing of other products. Any failure to enter into collaborative arrangements on favorable terms could delay or hinder our ability to develop and commercialize our products and could increase our costs of development and commercialization.\nIn the food, animal nutrition and chemicals markets, we have entered into a joint venture arrangement with Bunge that is focused on the manufacture of products in Brazil and development agreements with various other partners. In addition, we have entered into a commercial supply agreement with Unilever for specialty personal care ingredients and with BioMar for use of AlgaPrime\u2122 DHA in aquaculture. There can be no guarantee that we can successfully manage these strategic collaborations. Moreover, the exclusivity provisions of certain strategic arrangements limit our ability to commercialize our products outside of these arrangements.\nPursuant to the agreements described above and similar arrangements that we may enter into in the future, we may have limited or no control over the amount or timing of resources that any partner is able or willing to devote to our products or collaborative efforts. Any of our partners may fail to perform their obligations as expected. These partners may breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner. Further, our partners may not develop products arising out of our arrangements or devote sufficient resources to the development, manufacture, marketing, or sale of our products. Dependence on collaborative arrangements will also subject us to other risks, including:\n\u2022\nwe may be required to relinquish important rights, including intellectual property, marketing and distribution rights;\n\u2022\nwe may disagree with our partners as to rights to intellectual property we develop, or their research programs or commercialization activities;\n\u2022\nwe may have lower revenues than if we were to market and distribute such products ourselves;\n\u2022\na partner could separately develop and market a competing product either independently or in collaboration with others, including our competitors;\n\u2022\na partner could divest assets that are critical to our or our joint venture\u2019s operations to a third party that is less willing to cooperate with us or is less incentivized or able to manage such assets in a way that helps us achieve our operational and financial goals;\n\u2022\nour partners could become unable or less willing to expend their resources on research and development, commercialization efforts or the maintenance or supply of production services due to general market conditions, their financial condition or other circumstances beyond our control;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to manage multiple simultaneous partnerships or collaborations; and\n\u2022\nour partners may operate in countries where their operations could be adversely affected by changes in the local regulatory environment or by political unrest.\nMoreover, disagreements with a partner or former partner could develop, and any conflict with a partner or former partner could reduce our ability to enter into future collaboration agreements and negatively impact our relationships with one or more existing partners. If any of these events occurs, or if we fail to maintain our agreements with our partners, we may not be able to commercialize our existing and potential products, grow our business or generate sufficient revenues to support our operations. In addition, disagreements with a partner or former partner could result in disputes or litigation. Formal dispute resolution and litigation can require substantial time and resources, and the resolution of disputes and litigation may result in settlements or judgments that have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations or our financial condition. We are currently engaged in legal proceedings with our former partner Roquette Fr\u00e8res, S.A. (Roquette). For additional information regarding the Roquette proceedings, see Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nAdditionally, our business could be negatively impacted if any of our partners undergoes a change of control or were to otherwise assign the rights or obligations under any of our agreements to a competitor of ours or to a third party who is not willing to work with us on the same terms or commit the same resources as the current partner.\nOur relationship with our strategic partner Bunge may not prove successful.\nWe have entered into a joint venture with Bunge that is focused on the production of certain microalgae-based products in Brazil. In connection with the establishment of SB Oils, we entered into a development agreement and other agreements with Bunge and SB Oils. Since originally establishing the SB Oils JV, we have expanded the products and fields in which the joint venture is operating.\nOur ability to generate value from the SB Oils JV depends on, among other things, our ability to work cooperatively with Bunge and SB Oils for the commercialization of the products manufactured at the SB Oils production facility. We may not be able to do so. For example, under the joint venture agreements, Bunge has agreed to provide feedstock as well as utility services to the SB Oils production facility.\nIn addition, Bunge has announced that it is actively pursuing strategic alternatives for its Brazilian sugarcane business, which could involve the divestment, in whole or in part, of the assets of such business. While a new controlling entity would remain subject to the terms of the feedstock and utility supply agreements, that entity may be less willing to cooperate with us or SB Oils, which may adversely affect the development and commercialization of the products manufactured at the SB Oils production facility.\nMoreover, in March 2017, the SB Oils JV's independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Auditores Independentes has included a going concern uncertainty explanatory paragraph in its Independent Auditors' Report issued to the SB Oils JV. The SB Oils JV's business has not been generating sufficient cash flow from operations, and funds may not be available in an amount sufficient to enable it to pay its indebtedness, or to fund other liquidity needs, and it could utilize its available financial resources sooner than it currently expects. The SB Oils JV may not be able to raise sufficient additional funds on terms that are favorable to it, if at all. If the SB Oils JV fails to raise adequate funds and continues to incur losses, it will not be able to fund its operations or continue its business as a going concern.\nWe and Bunge each provide various administrative services to SB Oils, and Bunge also provides working capital to SB Oils through a revolving loan facility that matures on April 2, 2017. If Bunge does not extend the maturity date of the revolving loan facility, then SB Oils would need to find alternative sources of financing. SB Oils may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms, or at all, which may lead to increased equity investments in the SB Oils JV by us and Bunge, which we may not be able to fund. If we are unable to fund our financial obligations under the SB Oils JV arrangements, then SB Oils may not be able to continue as a going concern and this would have a material adverse effect on each of our and SB Oils' financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, Bunge does not have previous experience working with our technology, and we cannot be sure that SB Oils will be successful in commercializing its products. In addition, there may be delays or cost overruns in connection with the ramp up and optimization of the SB Oils production facility. There may also be delays in our negotiation of the corporate guarantee in connection with the JV BNDES Loan. In addition, we will be required to maintain the required license, granted by the S\u00e3o Paulo State Environmental Department, to operate the SB Oils production facility. Any negative event with respect to these issues would delay the development and commercialization of the products manufactured at the SB Oils production facility. Furthermore, the agreements governing our partnership are complex and cover a range of future activities, and disputes may arise between us and Bunge that could delay the ramp up of the SB Oils production facility, the expansion of SB Oils' production capacity and/or the development and commercialization of the products manufactured at the SB Oils production facility or cause the dissolution of the SB Oils JV. In addition, on February 28, 2017, Bunge Limited filed its 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K in which it reported equity investment impairment charges of $44 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 that included an impairment charge of Bunge's equity investment in the SB Oils JV. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements to this 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K for our analysis of our $42.4 million equity investment in the SB Oils JV.\nOur joint venture with Roquette has been dissolved. We are currently in litigation with Roquette and we may have other disputes with Roquette related to the joint venture's business.\nIn 2010, we entered into a 50/50 joint venture with Roquette Fr\u00e8res, S.A. (Roquette). As part of this relationship, we and Roquette formed Solazyme Roquette Nutritionals, LLC (SRN) through which both we and Roquette agreed to pursue certain opportunities in microalgae-based products for the food, nutraceuticals and animal feed markets. In June 2013, we and Roquette agreed to dissolve SRN and in July 2013, SRN was dissolved. As a result of the dissolution, the joint venture and operating\nagreement between us and Roquette, and the license agreement, whereby we licensed to SRN certain of our intellectual property, automatically terminated.\nWe and Roquette engaged in an arbitration proceeding concerning the proper assignment of the intellectual property of SRN. In February 2015 the arbitration panel awarded all such intellectual property to us, and this award was confirmed by the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware in December 2015 and this confirmation was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in December 2016. In addition, Roquette commenced two separate actions in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware for declarations that, among other things, the arbitrators exceeded their authority by failing to render a timely arbitration award and as a result any orders or awards issued by the arbitrators are void. Summary judgment in these matters requested by Roquette was denied by the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware in December 2015. We have counterclaimed for damages for misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of contract. In turn Roquette has counterclaimed that we have misused certain Roquette trade secrets. The proceedings are ongoing. See Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our proceedings with Roquette. We cannot be sure that other disputes will not arise between us and Roquette related to the joint venture's business. Such disagreements and disputes are costly, time-consuming to resolve and distracting to our management.\nDisputes regarding our intellectual property rights, and the rights of others (including Roquette) to manufacture and sell the products included in the SRN joint venture could delay or negatively impact our commercialization of products in the markets SRN was targeting. Any such disputes could be costly, time-consuming to resolve and distracting to our management. In addition, if our commercialization in these markets is delayed or unsuccessful, our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nWe cannot be sure that our products will meet necessary standards or be approved or accepted by customers in our target markets.\nIf we are unable to convince our potential customers or end users of our products that we are a reliable supplier, that our products are comparable or superior to the products that they currently use, or that the use of our products is otherwise beneficial to them, we will not be successful in entering our target markets and our business will be adversely affected.\nIn the food and nutrition market and in the animal nutrition market, our food ingredients and products will compete with oils and other food ingredients currently in use. Potential customers may not perceive a benefit to microalgae-based ingredients as compared to existing ingredients or may be otherwise unwilling to adopt their use. In addition, our branded food product is marketed directly to potential consumers, but we cannot be sure that consumers will continue to be attracted to our brand, be attracted to our new brands or products, or purchase our products on an ongoing basis. As a result, our branded products may not be successful, distribution partners may decide to discontinue marketing our products and our business will be adversely affected. If consumer packaged goods companies do not accept our food ingredients as ingredients for their finished products, or if end customers are unwilling to purchase finished products made using our products, we will not be successful in competing in the nutrition market and our business will be adversely affected. Customers in the nutrition market also may require lengthy and complex qualification procedures with respect to our products, our manufacturing capabilities, regulatory issues and other matters. Likewise, in the animal nutrition market, if customers are not willing to integrate our products into their animal nutrition products, our business will be adversely affected.\nIn the specialty personal care ingredients market, the potential customers for our or SB Oils' products are generally companies that have well-developed manufacturing processes and arrangements with suppliers for the components of their products and may resist changing these processes and components. These potential customers frequently impose lengthy and complex product qualification procedures on their suppliers, influenced by consumer preference, manufacturing considerations, supplier operating history, regulatory issues, product liability and other factors, many of which are unknown to, or not well understood by, us. Satisfying these processes may take many months or years.\nWe have entered into a limited number of binding, definitive commercial supply agreements. We also periodically enter into non-binding letters of intent with third parties regarding purchase of our products, but these agreements do not unconditionally obligate the other party to purchase any quantities of any products at this time. There can be no assurance that non-binding letters of intent will lead to unconditional definitive agreements to purchase our products.\nWe have limited experience in structuring arrangements with customers for the purchase of our microalgae-based products, and we may not be successful in this essential aspect of our business.\nWe expect that our customers will include large companies that sell food products, including aquaculture, nutrition products and specialty personal care products. Because we have only recently begun to commercialize ingredients for specialty\npersonal care products and our own food and food ingredient products, including aquaculture, and are still in the process of developing products and ingredients for the food, aquaculture, nutrition and specialty personal care markets, we have limited experience operating in our customers\u2019 industries and interacting with the customers that we intend to target. Developing the necessary expertise may take longer than we expect and will require that we expand and improve our sales and marketing capability, which could be costly. These activities could delay our ability to capitalize on the opportunities that we believe our technology and products present, and may prevent us from successfully commercializing our products. Further, we ultimately aim to sell large amounts of our products, and this will require that we effectively negotiate and manage contracts for these purchase and sale relationships. The companies with which we aim to have arrangements are generally much larger than we are and have substantially longer operating histories and more experience in their industries than we have. As a result, we may not succeed in establishing relationships with these companies and, if we do, we may not be effective in negotiating or managing the terms of such relationships, which could adversely affect our future results of operations.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims and other claims of our customers, partners and third parties.\nThe design, development, production and sale of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and the associated adverse publicity. Because some of our ultimate products in each of our target markets are used by consumers, and because use of those ultimate products may cause injury to those consumers and damage to property, we are subject to a risk of claims for such injuries and damages, claims from consumer packaged goods companies for the costs of removing finished products containing one or more of our ingredients from the market and costs to remove our branded food products from the market. In addition, we may be named directly in product liability suits relating to our products or third-party products integrating our products, even for defects resulting from errors of our partners, contract manufacturers or other third parties working with our products. These claims could be brought by various parties, including customers who are purchasing products directly from us or other users who purchase products from our customers or partners. We could also be named as co-parties in product liability suits that are brought against manufacturing partners that produce our products.\nIn addition, our customers, partners and third parties may bring suits against us alleging damages for the failure of our products to meet stated claims, specifications, warranties or other requirements. Any such suits, even if not successful, could be costly, disrupt the attention of our management and damage our negotiations with other partners and/or customers. Although we often seek to limit our product liability in our contracts, such limits may not be enforceable or may be subject to exceptions. Our current product liability and umbrella insurance for our business may be inadequate to cover all potential liability claims. Insurance coverage is expensive and may be difficult to obtain. Also, insurance coverage may not be available in the future on acceptable terms and may not be sufficient to cover potential claims. We cannot be sure that our contract manufacturers or manufacturing partners who produce our ultimate products will have adequate insurance coverage to cover against potential claims. If we experience a large insured loss, it may exceed our coverage limits, or our insurance carrier may decline to further cover us or may raise our insurance rates to unacceptable levels, any of which could impair our financial position and potentially cause us to go out of business.\nWe will face risks associated with our international business in developing countries and elsewhere.\nFor the foreseeable future, our business plan will likely subject us to risks associated with essential manufacturing, sales and operations in developing countries. We have limited experience to date manufacturing and selling internationally and such expansion will require us to make significant expenditures, including the hiring of local employees and establishing facilities, in advance of generating any revenue. The economies of many of the countries in which we or our joint venture, partners or customers operate or will operate have been characterized by frequent and occasionally extensive government intervention and unstable economic cycles.\nIn addition, in Brazil, where SB Oils is located, there are restrictions on the foreign ownership of land, which may affect SB Oils' ownership rights in the production facility site or in any additional land purchased.\nInternational business operations are subject to local legal, political, regulatory and social requirements and economic conditions and our business, financial performance and prospects may be adversely affected by, among others, the following factors:\n\u2022\npolitical, economic, diplomatic or social instability;\n\u2022\nland reform movements;\n\u2022\ntariffs, export or import restrictions, restrictions on remittances abroad or repatriation of profits, duties or taxes that limit our ability to move our products out of these countries or interfere with the import of essential materials into these countries;\n\u2022\ninflation, changing interest rates and exchange controls;\n\u2022\ntax burden and policies;\n\u2022\ndelays or failures in securing licenses, permits or other governmental approvals necessary to build and operate facilities and use our microalgae strains to produce products;\n\u2022\nthe imposition of limitations on products or processes and the production or sale of those products or processes;\n\u2022\nuncertainties relating to foreign laws, including labor laws, regulations and restrictions, and legal proceedings;\n\u2022\nforeign ownership rules and changes in regard thereto;\n\u2022\nan inability, or reduced ability, to protect our intellectual property, including any effect of compulsory licensing imposed by government action;\n\u2022\nsuccessful compliance with U.S. and foreign laws that regulate the conduct of business abroad, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\ninsufficient investment in developing countries in public infrastructure, including transportation infrastructure, and disruption of transportation and logistics services; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations.\nThese and other factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur international operations may expose us to the risk of fluctuation in currency exchange rates and rates of foreign inflation, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe currently incur some costs and expenses in Brazilian Reals and expect in the future to incur additional expenses in these and other foreign currencies, and also derive a portion of our revenues in the local currencies of customers throughout the world. As a result, our revenues and results of operations are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations, which we may not be able to manage successfully. During the past few decades, the Brazilian currency in particular has faced frequent and substantial exchange rate fluctuations in relation to the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies. For example, the value of the Brazilian Real has fluctuated significantly against the U.S. dollar over the past few years. There can be no assurance that the Real will not significantly appreciate or depreciate against the U.S. dollar in the future. We bear the risk that the rate of inflation in the foreign countries where we incur costs and expenses or the decline in value of the U.S. dollar compared to those foreign currencies will increase our costs as expressed in U.S. dollars. Future measures by foreign governments to control inflation, including interest rate adjustments, intervention in the foreign exchange market and changes to the fixed value of their currencies, may trigger increases in inflation. We may not be able to adjust the prices of our products to offset the effects of inflation on our cost structure, which could increase our costs and reduce our net operating margins. If we do not successfully manage these risks through hedging or other mechanisms, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may encounter difficulties managing our business as it evolves, and we will need to properly prioritize our efforts in our target markets as our business grows. If we are unable to do so, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur business has encountered periods of rapid growth and evolution. Rapid growth or evolution places a strain on our human and capital resources. If we grow or evolve too rapidly or if our headcount or other aspects of our operating structure become misaligned with our strategy, we may need to reduce headcount or other operating costs. For example, in December 2014, as part of an adjustment to our operating and expense strategy related to the ramping up of SB Oils' production facility, we announced the intention to decrease operating expenses through a reduction in workforce and other cost-cutting measures. See the risk factor titled \u201cWe may experience significant delays and/or cost overruns in financing, designing, constructing and ramping up large commercial manufacturing facilities, which could result in harm to our business and prospects\u201d above for more information. In addition, in January 2016, as part of our continuing strategy to focus operations on targeted, higher-value product categories, we streamlined operations by reducing our workforce. Such reductions in workforce can have an adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, we intend to conduct our business internationally and anticipate business operations in the United States, Europe, Latin America and elsewhere. These diversified, global operations place increased demands on our limited resources and may require us to expand the capabilities of our administrative and operational resources and will require us to attract, train,\nmanage and retain qualified management, technicians, scientists and other personnel. As our operations shift or expand domestically and internationally, we will need to continue to manage multiple locations and additional relationships with various customers, partners, suppliers and other third parties across several product categories and markets.\nIn the past, our business has taken place across several target markets: food and nutrition, skin and personal care, fuels and chemicals, and oil field services. We will be required to prioritize our limited financial and managerial resources as we pursue particular development and commercialization efforts in our target markets of food, including aquaculture, nutrition and specialty personal care ingredients. Any resources we expend on one or more of these efforts could be at the expense of other potentially profitable opportunities. If we focus our efforts and resources on one or more of our target markets and they do not lead to commercially viable products, our revenues, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, as our operations grow or evolve, the simultaneous management of development, production and commercialization across our target markets could become increasingly complex and may result in less than optimal allocation of management and other administrative resources, increase our operating expenses and harm our operating results.\nOur ability to effectively manage our operations, growth and various projects across our target markets will require us to make additional investments in our infrastructure to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees, which we may be unable to do effectively. We may be unable to successfully manage our expenses in the future, which may negatively impact our gross margins or operating margins in any particular quarter.\nIn addition, we may not be able to improve our management information and control systems, including our internal control over financial reporting, to a level necessary to manage our growth or evolution and we may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls that we may not be able to remediate in an efficient or timely manner.\nWe are involved, and may become involved in the future, in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe, and certain of our officers and directors, are involved, and may be involved in the future, in legal proceedings and claims arising in the course of our business. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and there can be no assurance that such legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows. See Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this report for a description of the material legal proceedings in which we are currently engaged.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of any legal proceeding in which we are engaged. Moreover, any conclusion of legal proceedings in a manner adverse to us could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and business. Even if we are successful in litigation, we could incur substantial costs, suffer a significant adverse impact on our reputation and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from other priorities, including the execution of business plans and strategies that are important to our ability to grow our business, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Legal proceedings may result in significant legal expenses, settlement costs or damage awards that are not covered by, or exceed the limits of, our liability insurance, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.\nOur success depends in part on recruiting and retaining key personnel and, if we fail to do so, it may be more difficult for us to execute our business strategy.\nOur success depends on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, business development, manufacturing and scientific personnel and directors, and on our ability to develop and maintain important relationships with leading academic institutions and scientists. We are dependent upon a number of key members of our senior management, including executive, manufacturing, business development and scientific personnel, and on our directors. If any of such persons left, our business could be harmed. All of our employees and directors are at-will and may resign at any time. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or directors could delay or have an impact on the successful commercialization of our products. We do not maintain any key man insurance. Competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area. We may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel. In addition, the restructurings that we implemented in December 2014 and January 2016 could have an adverse impact on our ability to retain and recruit qualified personnel. If we are unsuccessful in our recruitment efforts, we may be unable to execute our strategy.\nWe may not be able to meet applicable regulatory requirements for the sale of our microalgae-based products and the operation of production facilities, and, even if requirements are met, complying on an ongoing basis with the numerous regulatory requirements applicable to our various product categories and facilities will be time-consuming and costly.\nOur food and nutrition products are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), state and local agencies and similar agencies outside the United States. In the U.S., food ingredients are regulated either as food additives or as substances generally recognized as safe, or GRAS. A GRAS self-determination can be made with respect to a substance by its manufacturer upon the receipt of an opinion from a panel of qualified experts who determine that the substance is GRAS for its intended conditions of use. A GRAS Notice for one algae oil was submitted to the FDA in June 2011, and a \u201cno questions\u201d letter was received from the FDA in June 2012. A GRAS Notice for each of whole algae flour and whole algae protein was submitted to the FDA, and a \u201cno questions\u201d letter was received from the FDA in 2013 for whole algae flour, in 2014 for whole algae protein and in 2015 for our second algae oil, an oleic algae oil. If the FDA were to disagree with the conclusions in future GRAS Notices, they could ask that the products be voluntarily withdrawn from the market or could initiate legal action to halt their sale. Such actions by the FDA could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of our operations. Food ingredients that are not GRAS are regulated as food additives and require FDA approval prior to commercialization. The food additive petition process is generally expensive and time consuming with approval, if secured, taking years. In Brazil, we submitted applications to the Brazilian Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) for approval of various food products. We received food approval with no restrictions for our whole algae flour in July 2015 and for whole algae protein in December 2016. In Canada, we received a Letter of No Objection for whole algae flour in February 2016. Other products may or may not be approved in the future. Any significant delay or disapproval of our food products by ANVISA, Health Canada or other government agencies in these or other countries would adversely affect our food and nutrition business in these and other countries.\nThe sale of ingredients for use in animal feed is regulated by agencies including the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine. Regulatory requirements for suitability must be met by providing data from studies, which may cause delays and the incursion of additional costs. Any significant delay or disapproval by government agencies of our animal nutrition products would have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur chemical products may be subject to government regulation in our target markets. In the United States, the EPA administers the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which regulates the commercial registration, distribution, and use of chemicals. TSCA requires us to comply with the Microbial Commercial Activity Notice (MCAN) process to manufacture and distribute products made from our recombinant microalgae strains. An MCAN is not required for non-recombinant strains. To date, we have filed MCANs for certain of our recombinant microalgae strains, all of which have been dropped from review. Our subsequent filing of Notices of Commencement (NOC) relating to previously filed MCANs allows us to commercially use these strains. We expect to file additional MCANs in the future.\nBefore we can manufacture or distribute significant volumes of a chemical, we need to determine whether that chemical is listed in the TSCA inventory. If the substance is listed, then manufacture or distribution can commence immediately. If not, then a pre-manufacture notice (PMN) must be filed with the EPA for a review period of up to 90 days excluding extensions. We have filed PMNs for certain of our products and expect to file additional PMNs in the future. Some of the products we produce or plan to produce are already on the TSCA inventory due to our successful PMN submissions and filed NOCs. Others are not yet listed. We may not be able to expediently receive approval from the EPA to list the chemicals we would like to make on the TSCA inventory, resulting in delays or significant increases in testing requirements. A similar program exists in the European Union, called REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemical Substances). We are required to register some of our products with the European Commission, and this process could cause delays or significant costs. We have determined that some of our algae oils are exempt from REACH registration requirements. To the extent that other geographies, such as Brazil, may rely on the TSCA or REACH for chemical registration in their geographies, delays with the U.S. or European authorities may subsequently delay entry into these markets as well. Furthermore, other geographies may have their own chemical inventory requirements, which may delay entry into these markets, irrespective of U.S. or European approval.\nChanges in regulatory requirements, laws and policies, or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements, laws and policies, may result in increased compliance costs, delays, capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nWe expect to encounter regulations in most if not all of the countries in which we may seek to sell our products, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary approvals in a timely manner or at all. If our products do not meet applicable regulatory requirements in a particular country or at all, then we may not be able to commercialize them and our business will be adversely affected. The various regulatory schemes applicable to our products will continue to apply following initial approval for sale. Monitoring regulatory changes and ensuring our ongoing compliance with applicable requirements is\ntime-consuming and may affect our results of operations. If we fail to comply with such requirements on an ongoing basis, we may be subject to fines or other penalties, or may be prevented from selling our products, and our business may be harmed.\nThe construction and operation of our, our partners\u2019 or our joint venture's production facilities are likely to require government approvals. If we are not able to obtain or maintain the necessary approvals in a timely manner or at all, our business will be adversely affected. In February 2014, the S\u00e3o Paulo State Environmental Department granted a license to operate the SB Oils production facility, which was necessary to begin commercial production.\nWe may incur significant costs complying with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities.\nWe use hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials in our business and are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations governing, among other matters, the use, generation, manufacture, transportation, storage, handling, disposal of, and human exposure to, these materials both in the U.S. and outside the U.S., including regulation by governmental regulatory agencies, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the EPA. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with these laws and regulations.\nAlthough we have implemented safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials and waste products in an effort to comply with these laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that our safety measures will be compliant or capable of eliminating the risk of injury or contamination from the generation, manufacturing, use, storage, transportation, handling, disposal of, and human exposure to, hazardous materials. Failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws could subject us to liability and resulting damages. There can be no assurance that violations of environmental, health and safety laws will not occur as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and the failure to comply with past, present, or future laws could result in the imposition of fines, regulatory oversight costs, third party property damage, product liability and personal injury claims, investigation and remediation costs, the suspension of production, or a cessation of operations, and our liability may exceed our total assets. Liability under environmental laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act in the United States, can impose liability for the full amount of damages, without regard to comparative fault for the investigation and cleanup of contamination and impacts to human health and for damages to natural resources. Contamination at properties we own and operate, and at properties to which we send hazardous materials, may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations.\nOur business and operations will be affected by other new environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, which may affect our research and development and manufacturing programs, and environmental laws could become more stringent over time, requiring us to change our operations, or resulting in greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations, which could impair our research, development or production efforts and harm our business. The costs of complying with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and any claims concerning noncompliance or liability with respect to contamination in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.\nWe may face risks relating to the use of our targeted recombinant microalgae strains, and if we are not able to meet applicable regulatory requirements for the use of these strains or if we face material ethical, legal and social concerns about our use of targeted recombinant technology, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe use of microorganisms designed using targeted recombinant technology, such as some of our microalgae strains, is subject to laws and regulations in many states and countries, some of which are new and still evolving and interpreted by fact specific application. In the U.S. the EPA regulates the commercial use of microorganisms designed using targeted recombinant technology as well as potential products derived from them.\nWe expect to encounter regulations of microorganisms designed using targeted recombinant technology in most if not all of the countries in which we may seek to establish manufacturing operations, and the scope and nature of these regulations will likely be different from country to country. For example, in the U.S., when used in an industrial process, our microalgae strains designed using targeted recombinant technology may be considered new chemicals under the TSCA, administered by the EPA. We will be required to comply with the EPA\u2019s process. In Brazil, microorganisms designed using targeted recombinant technology are regulated by the National Biosafety Technical Commission, or CTNBio. In March 2013, we submitted an application for approval from CTNBio to use a specific microalgae strain designed using targeted recombinant technology in a contained environment in order to use these microalgae for research and development and commercial production purposes in any facilities we establish in Brazil. We obtained approval for this application from CTNBio in October 2013, and we have\nsince received several approvals related to additional applications we had submitted. In February 2014, CTNBio granted a CQB (Certificate of Quality in Biosafety) to the SB Oils production facility for activities including industrial production, import and export, disposal and storage of our key production organisms. If we cannot meet the applicable requirements in countries in which we intend to produce microalgae-based products, or if it takes longer than anticipated to obtain such approvals, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe subject of organisms designed using targeted recombinant technology has received negative publicity, which has aroused public debate. Public attitudes about the safety and environmental hazards of, and ethical concerns over, genetic research and microorganisms designed using targeted recombinant technology could influence public acceptance of our technology and products. In addition, shifting public attitudes regarding, and potential changes to laws governing, ownership of genetic material could harm our intellectual property rights with respect to our genetic material and discourage collaborators from supporting, developing, or commercializing our products, processes and technologies. Governmental reaction to negative publicity concerning organisms designed using targeted recombinant technology could result in greater government regulation of or trade restrictions on imports of genetic research and derivative products. If we and/or our collaborators are not able to overcome the ethical, legal, and social concerns relating to the use of targeted recombinant technology, our products and processes may not be accepted or we could face increased expenses, delays or other impediments to their commercialization.\nWe expect to face competition for our food and nutrition, animal nutrition and specialty personal care ingredients and products from other companies in these fields, many of whom have greater resources and experience than we do. If we cannot compete effectively against these companies or their products, we may not be successful in selling our ingredients or products or further growing our business.\nWe expect that our food, nutrition, animal nutrition and specialty personal care ingredients and products will compete with providers in the specialty, mass food ingredient and animal nutrition markets. Many of these companies, such as Cargill, Incorporated, Monsanto Company, Syngenta AG and Roquette Fr\u00e8res, S.A., are substantially larger than we are, have well-developed distribution systems and networks for their products, and valuable historical relationships with the potential customers and distributors we hope to serve and have substantially greater resources than we do. We may also compete with companies seeking to produce food, nutrition and animal nutrition products based on renewable oils, including DSM Food Specialties and DuPont Nutrition & Health. Our success in the development of food, nutrition and animal nutrition products will depend on our ability to effectively compete with established companies and successfully commercialize our products. We believe the primary competitive factors in the food, nutrition, animal nutrition and specialty personal care ingredient and product markets are product performance, cost-in-use, sustainability, and availability of supply.\nWe expect to face competition for our products in the specialty personal care market from providers of products based on petroleum, plant oils and animal fats and from other companies seeking to provide alternatives to these products, many of whom have greater resources and experience than we do. If we cannot compete effectively against these companies or products, our business could be harmed and certain of our strategic alternatives could be adversely impacted.\nIn the specialty personal care market, we will compete with the established providers of oils currently used in specialty personal care products. Producers of these incumbent products include global oil companies, including those selling agricultural products such as palm oil, palm kernel oil, shea butter, cacao butter, argan oil, almond oil and sunflower oil, large international personal care companies and other companies specializing in specific products or essential oils. We may also compete in one or more of these markets with manufacturers of other products such as highly refined mineral oils and other petroleum-based fluids, as well as new market entrants.\nWe believe the primary competitive factors in the specialty personal care market are product price, product performance, sustainability, availability of supply and compatibility of products with existing formulations.\nCompanies with whom we compete and expect to compete are much larger than we are, have, in most cases, well-developed distribution systems and networks for their products, have valuable historical relationships with the potential customers we are seeking to serve and have much more extensive sales and marketing programs in place to promote their products. Some of our competitors may use their influence to impede the development and acceptance of our products. Our limited resources relative to many of our competitors may cause us to fail to anticipate or respond adequately to new developments and other competitive pressures. In the nascent markets for renewable oils, it is difficult to predict which, if any, market entrants will be successful, and we may lose market share to competitors producing new or existing renewable products. If we are unsuccessful in competing in the specialty personal care market, our business could be harmed and certain of our strategic alternatives could be adversely impacted.\nA decline in the price of petroleum and petroleum-based products, plant oils or other commodities may reduce demand for our products and may otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe anticipate that many of our oils will be marketed as alternatives to corresponding products based on petroleum and plant oils. When the price of any of these oils falls, as they have recently, we may be unable to produce algae oils or other products that are cost-effective alternatives to their petroleum or plant oil-based counterparts. Declining oil prices, or the perception of a future decline in oil prices, may adversely affect the prices we can obtain from our potential customers or prevent potential customers from entering into agreements with us to buy our products. During sustained periods of lower oil prices we may be unable to sell our products, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. For example, in part as a result of the recent drop in the prices of petroleum and certain plant oils, the ramp up of the SB Oils production facility in Brazil will be slower than, and the mix of products manufactured in that facility will be different from, what we previously anticipated as production will be focused primarily on higher margin products.\nPrices of plant oils have experienced significant volatility, and this volatility is expected to persist. If prices for plant oils remain at low levels, there may be less demand for oil alternatives, which could reduce demand for our products and harm our business. The prices of commodities that serve as food ingredients have also been volatile. To the extent that the prices of these commodities decline and remain at lower levels for extended periods of time, the demand for our food, including aquaculture, nutrition and specialty personal care ingredients and products may be reduced, and our ability to successfully compete in this market may be harmed.\nOur information technology systems, processes and sites may suffer a significant breach or disruption that may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nOur information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, provide critical data and services for internal and external users, including procurement and inventory management, transaction processing, financial, commercial and operational data, human resources management, legal and tax compliance information and other information and processes necessary to operate and manage our business. Our information technology and infrastructure may experience attacks by hackers, breaches or other failures or disruptions that could compromise our systems and the information stored there. While we have implemented security measures and disaster recovery plans designed to protect the security and continuity of our networks and critical systems, these measures may not adequately prevent adverse events such as breaches or failures from occurring or mitigate their severity if they do occur. If our information technology systems are breached, damaged or fail to function properly due to any number of causes, such as security breaches or cyber-based attacks, systems implementation difficulties, catastrophic events or power outages, and our security, contingency or disaster recovery plans do not effectively mitigate these occurrences on a timely basis, we may experience a material disruption in our ability to manage our business operations. We may also be subject to legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, potential regulatory penalties and damage to our reputation. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as our competitive position.\nOur facilities in California are located near an earthquake fault, and an earthquake or other natural disaster or resource shortage could disrupt our operations.\nImportant documents and records, such as hard copies of our laboratory books and records for our products and some of our manufacturing operations, are located in our corporate headquarters in South San Francisco, California, near active earthquake zones. In the event of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, drought or flood, or localized extended outages of critical utilities or transportation systems, we do not have a formal business continuity or disaster recovery plan, and could therefore experience a significant business interruption. In addition, California from time to time has experienced shortages of water, electric power and natural gas. Future shortages and conservation measures could disrupt our operations and could result in additional expense. Although we maintain business interruption insurance coverage, we do not maintain earthquake or flood coverage.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur competitive position depends on our ability to effectively obtain and enforce patents related to our products, manufacturing components and manufacturing processes. If we or our licensors fail to adequately protect this intellectual property, our ability and/or our partners\u2019 ability to commercialize products could suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection sufficient to prevent others from utilizing our manufacturing components, manufacturing processes or marketing our products, as well as to successfully defend\nand enforce our patents against infringement by others. In order to protect our products, manufacturing components and manufacturing processes from unauthorized use by third parties, we must hold patent rights that cover our products, manufacturing components and manufacturing processes.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and bio-industrial companies can be highly uncertain because obtaining and determining the scope of patent rights involves complex legal and factual questions. The standards applied by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and foreign patent offices in granting patents are different and not always applied uniformly or predictably. There is no uniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter, the scope of claims allowable in biotechnology and bio-industrial patents, or the formal requirements to obtain such patents. Consequently, patents may not issue from our pending patent applications. Furthermore, in the process of seeking patent protection or even after a patent is granted, we could become subject to expensive and protracted proceedings, including patent interference, opposition, post-grant review, invalidation proceedings and re-examination proceedings, which could invalidate or narrow the scope of our patent rights. As such, we do not know nor can we predict the scope and/or breadth of patent protection that we might obtain on our products and technology.\nChanges either in patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property rights. In the U.S., depending on the decisions and actions taken by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. In foreign jurisdictions, depending on the decisions and actions taken by the foreign government, the judicial system of the jurisdiction, and its patent office, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents or patents that we might obtain in the future.\nThe America Invents Act (AIA), which was signed into law on September 16, 2011, brought a number of changes to the U.S. patent system and affects the way patents are prosecuted, challenged and litigated. Among the changes that went into effect on September 16, 2012, one of the most significant involves the implementation of a reformed post-grant review system. Other changes, which went into effect on March 16, 2013, include the transition from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d to \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system that attempts to harmonize the laws of the U.S. with the laws of most of the world. Lack of precedential interpretation of the new provisions of the AIA through specific cases or through guidelines promulgated by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the lack of binding precedent from the courts increase the uncertainty of the impact of the AIA. Together, these changes may increase the costs of prosecution and enforcement of U.S. patents. While it is currently unclear what impact these changes will have on the operation of our business, they may favor companies able to dedicate more resources to patent filings and challenges.\nRisks associated with enforcing our intellectual property rights in the United States and elsewhere.\nIf we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent claiming one of our technologies, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable or assert that the patent does not cover its manufacturing processes, manufacturing components or products. Proving patent infringement may be difficult, especially where it is possible to manufacture a product by multiple processes or when a patented process is performed by multiple parties. Patent litigation is also costly, time-consuming and distracting to our management. Furthermore, in patent litigation in the United States or elsewhere, defendant counterclaims alleging both invalidity and unenforceability are commonplace. Although we believe that we have conducted our patent prosecution in accordance with the duty of candor and in good faith, the outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With respect to the validity of our patent rights, we cannot be certain, for example, that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would not be able to exclude others from practicing the inventions claimed therein. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse effect on our business. Defendant counterclaims of antitrust or other anti-competitive conduct are also commonplace.\nEven if our patent rights are found to be valid and enforceable, patent claims that survive litigation may not cover commercially viable products or prevent competitors from importing or marketing products similar to our own, or using manufacturing processes or manufacturing components similar to our own.\nAlthough we believe we have obtained valid assignments of patent rights from all inventors, if an inventor did not adequately assign their patent rights to us, a third party could obtain a license to the patent from such inventor. This could preclude us from enforcing the patent against such third party.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nThe laws of some foreign countries where we intend to produce and use our proprietary strains in collaboration with sugar mills or other feedstock suppliers do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, including Brazil, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology and/or bio-industrial technologies. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights in these countries. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in certain foreign jurisdictions are unpredictable and could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate.\nThird parties may misappropriate our proprietary strains, information, or trade secrets despite a contractual obligation not to do so.\nThird parties (including joint venture, collaboration, development and feedstock partners and former partners, contract manufacturers, and other contractors and shipping agents) often have custody or control of our proprietary microbe strains. If our proprietary microbe strains were stolen, misappropriated or reverse engineered, they could be used by other parties who may be able to use our strains or reverse-engineered strains for their own commercial gain. It is difficult to prevent misappropriation or subsequent reverse engineering. In the event that our proprietary microbe strains are misappropriated, it could be difficult for us to challenge the misappropriation or prevent reverse engineering, especially in countries with limited legal and intellectual property protection.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and third parties may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of proprietary information and trade secrets.\nIn addition to patents, we rely on confidentiality agreements to protect our technical know-how and other proprietary information. Confidentiality agreements are used, for example, when we talk to potential strategic partners. In addition, each of our employees signed a confidentiality agreement upon joining our company. Nevertheless, there can be no guarantee that an employee or an outside party will not make an unauthorized disclosure or use of our proprietary confidential information. This might happen intentionally or inadvertently. It is possible that a competitor will make use of such information, and that our competitive position will be compromised, in spite of any legal action we might take against persons making such unauthorized disclosures.\nWe also keep as trade secrets certain technical and proprietary information where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate, desirable or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators, partners, former partners and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our trade secrets to competitors or otherwise use misappropriated trade secrets to compete with us. It can be expensive and time consuming to enforce a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets. Furthermore, the outcome of such claims is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to or may not protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently design around our intellectual property or develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how without misappropriating or otherwise violating our trade secret rights. Where a third party independently designs around our intellectual property or develops equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how without misappropriating or otherwise violating our trade secret rights, they may be able to seek patent protection for such equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. This could prohibit us from practicing our trade secrets.\nClaims by patent holders that our products or manufacturing processes infringe their patent rights could result in costly litigation or could require substantial time and money to resolve, whether or not we are successful, and an unfavorable outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to commercialize our technology depends on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products without infringing the proprietary rights of patent holders or their authorized agents. An issued patent does not guarantee us the right to practice or utilize the patented inventions or commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have blocking patents that may prevent us from commercializing our patented products and utilizing our patented manufacturing components and manufacturing processes. In the event that we are made aware of blocking third party patents, we cannot be sure that licenses to the blocking third-party patents would be available or obtainable on terms favorable to us or at all.\nNumerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, relate to (1) the production of bio-industrial products, including edible ingredients, oils, chemicals and drilling fluids, and (2) the use of microalgae strains, such as microalgae strains containing genes to alter their oil composition. As such, there could be existing valid patents that our manufacturing processes, manufacturing components, or products may inadvertently infringe. There could also be existing invalid or unenforceable patents that could nevertheless be asserted against us and would require expenditure of resources to defend against. In addition, there are pending patent applications that are currently unpublished and therefore unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that are infringed by our products, manufacturing processes or other aspects of our business.\nWe may be exposed to future litigation based on claims that our products, manufacturing processes or manufacturing components infringe the intellectual property rights of others. There is inevitable uncertainty in any litigation, including patent litigation. Defending against claims of patent infringement is costly and time consuming, regardless of the outcome. Thus, even if we were to ultimately prevail, or to settle at an early stage of litigation, such litigation could burden us with substantial unanticipated costs. Some of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater resources. These competitors are, therefore, likely to be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation longer than we could. In addition, the costs and uncertainty associated with patent litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our internal research and development programs, in-license needed technology, or enter into strategic partnerships that would help us commercialize our technologies. In addition, litigation or threatened litigation could result in significant demands on the time and attention of our management team, distracting them from the pursuit of other company business.\nIf a party successfully asserts a patent or other intellectual property rights against us, we might be barred from using certain of our manufacturing processes or manufacturing components, or from developing and commercializing related products. Injunctions against using specified processes or components, or prohibitions against commercializing specified products, could be imposed by a court or by a settlement agreement between us and a third party. In addition, we may be required to pay substantial damage awards to the third party, including treble or enhanced damages if we are found to have willfully infringed the third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. We may also be required to obtain a license from the third party in order to continue manufacturing and/or marketing the products that were found to infringe. It is possible that the necessary license will not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. This could limit our ability to competitively commercialize some or all of our products.\nDuring the course of any patent litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, rulings on motions, and other interim proceedings in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors regard these announcements as negative, the perceived value of our products, technology or intellectual property could be diminished. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nWe have received government funding in connection with the development of certain of our proprietary technologies, which could negatively affect our intellectual property rights in such technologies.\nSome of our proprietary technology was developed with U.S. federal government funding. When new technologies are developed with U.S. government funding, the government obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a nonexclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention for non-commercial purposes. These rights may permit the government to disclose our confidential information to third parties and to exercise \u201cmarch-in\u201d rights to use or allow third parties to use our patented technology. The government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the U.S. government-funded technology, and/or because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations, or to give preference to U.S. industry. In addition, U.S. government-funded inventions must be reported to the government and U.S. government funding must be disclosed in any resulting patent applications. In addition, our rights in such inventions are subject to government license rights and foreign manufacturing restrictions. Any exercise by the government of such rights could harm our competitive position or impact our operating results.\nIn addition, some of our technology was funded by a grant from the State of California. Inventions funded by this grant may be subject to forfeiture if we do not seek to patent or practically apply them. Any such forfeiture could have a materially adverse effect on our business. For proprietary technology developed with funding from the State of California, certain confidential information may be disclosed to third parties by the State of California. Our rights in such inventions are subject to the State of California's license and march-in rights. Any exercise by the State of California of such rights could harm our competitive position or impact our operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Finances and Capital Requirements\nOur financial results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.\nOur revenues and results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter because of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Factors that could cause our quarterly results of operations to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nachievement, or failure to achieve, technology or product development milestones needed to allow us to enter target markets on a cost effective basis;\n\u2022\ndelays or greater than anticipated expenses or time associated with the completion of new manufacturing facilities and the ramp up to nameplate capacity and optimization of production following completion of a new manufacturing facility;\n\u2022\ndelays or greater than anticipated expenses associated with the provision of key support and/or operational services to manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\nour capital requirements or capital requirements of our joint venture or other collaborations;\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively manage larger working capital positions as we increase commercial production and distribution of our products;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the production process at any facility where we produce our products, including due to equipment failure or accidents;\n\u2022\nthe timing, size and mix of sales to customers for our products;\n\u2022\nincreases in price or decreases in availability of feedstocks such as sucrose from sugarcane and/or dextrose from corn;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the price of, and demand for, products based on petroleum or other oils for which our products are alternatives;\n\u2022\nthe unavailability of contract manufacturing capacity altogether or at anticipated cost;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nseasonal production and sale of our products;\n\u2022\nthe effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products;\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenses associated with changes in governmental regulations and environmental, health and safety requirements;\n\u2022\nreductions or changes to existing regulations and policies that impact the food, including aquaculture, nutrition, or specialty personal care markets;\n\u2022\ndeparture of key employees;\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions, such as earthquakes and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\nour ability to integrate businesses that we may acquire;\n\u2022\nour ability to transition out of businesses that we may divest;\n\u2022\nour ability to generate sufficient cash flows to fund our operations and continue as a going concern;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with the international aspects of our business; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic, industry and market conditions, both domestically and in foreign markets in which we operate.\nDue to these factors and others, the results of any quarterly or annual period may not meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors and may not be meaningful indications of our future performance.\nDespite our current debt levels, we may still incur substantially more debt or take other actions that would intensify the risks discussed above.\nDespite our current consolidated debt levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments, some of which may be secured debt. We are not restricted under the terms of the indentures governing the 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indentures governing the 2018 Notes and the 2019 Notes that could have the effect of diminishing our ability to make payments on the notes when due. The SVB Facility restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, but if the facility matures or is repaid, we may not be subject to such restrictions under the terms of any subsequent indebtedness.\nWe have received government grant funding and entered contracts with government agencies, and may pursue government grant funding or contracts in the future. Our receipt of government funds through grants and contracts subjects us to additional regulatory oversight.\nWe have received government grants and have entered contracts with government agencies in the past. Activities funded by a government grant or pursuant to government contracts are subject to audits by government agencies. As part of an audit, these agencies may review our performance, cost structures and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. Grant funds must be applied by us toward the research and development programs specified by the granting agency, rather than for all of our programs generally. If any of our grant-funded costs are found to be allocated improperly, the costs may not be reimbursed and any costs already reimbursed may have to be refunded. Accordingly, an audit could result in an adjustment to our revenues and results of operations. We are also subject to additional regulations based on our receipt of government grant funding and entry into government contracts. If we fail to comply with the requirements under our grants or contracts, we may face penalties or other negative consequences, and in such event we may not be awarded government funding or contracts in the future.\nThe sale of our Algenist business involves risks, and we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits from the transaction, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOn August 16, 2016, we closed the sale of our Algenist business to TCP Algenist LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Buyer) and Algenist Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Algenist Holdings) in exchange for $20.2 million in cash, 601,969 shares of common stock of Algenist Holdings (amounting to 19.9% of its outstanding capital stock at closing) and the assumption of substantially all of the liabilities related to the Algenist business by Algenist Holdings (collectively, the \u201cTransaction\u201d). As part of the Transaction, we agreed to provide Algenist Holdings with certain transition services following the closing of the Transaction, which could result in diversion of internal resources from our core businesses.\nWe also expect to continue to supply active ingredients formulated in the Algenist product line to Algenist Holdings. We may not, however, be able to realize the anticipated benefits from our minority holdings or this supply arrangement, as we do not control the Algenist business, including with respect to the operation of the business and the amount or timing of resources that Buyer devotes to the Algenist business or this supply arrangement. Our minority interest in the Algenist business and supply arrangement with Algenist Holdings may not provide us with a return on investment and our investment may lose some or all of its value.\nIn addition, under the terms of the sale agreement, subject to certain limitations, we agreed to indemnify Buyer and certain other parties against breaches of our representations, warranties or covenants in the sale agreement and other specified damages, and certain liabilities related to the Algenist business not expressly assumed by Algenist Holdings. If Buyer makes a claim for indemnification against us, we may incur expenses to contest or resolve the claim (including indemnifiable damages for third party claims, if adversely decided) that could adversely affect our financial results.\nIf we engage in any acquisitions, we will incur a variety of costs and may potentially face numerous risks that could adversely affect our business and operations.\nIf appropriate opportunities become available, we may seek to acquire additional businesses, assets, technologies or products to enhance our business. In connection with any acquisitions, we could issue additional equity or equity-linked securities such as the 2018 Notes or 2019 Notes, which would dilute our stockholders, incur substantial debt to fund the acquisitions, or assume significant liabilities.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, including problems integrating the purchased operations, technologies or products, unanticipated costs and other liabilities, diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core businesses, adverse effects on existing business relationships with current and/or prospective collaborators, customers and/or suppliers, risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience and potential loss of key employees. Acquisitions may also require us to record goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, and incur write offs and restructuring and other related expenses, any of which could harm our operating results and financial condition. If we fail in our integration efforts with respect to any of our acquisitions and are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nRaising additional funds may cause dilution to our stockholders or require us to relinquish valuable rights.\nIf we elect to raise additional funds through equity offerings or offerings of equity-linked securities, our stockholders would likely experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may subject us to restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility in conducting future business activities. For example, the SVB Facility contains financial covenants that, if breached, would require us to secure our obligations thereunder. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary for us to share a portion of the margin from the sale of our products. We may also be required to relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or products that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we might not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud; in that case, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and could negatively impact the price of our stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. In addition, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us and our independent registered public accounting firm to evaluate and report on our internal control over financial reporting, and have our chief executive officer and chief financial officer certify as to the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports. The process of implementing our internal controls and complying with Section 404 is expensive and time consuming, and requires significant attention from management. We cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future.\nOur management has concluded that there were no material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. However, there can be no assurance that our controls over financial processes and reporting will be effective in the future or that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls will not be discovered in the future. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements. Failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm discover a material weakness, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, could reduce the market\u2019s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price.\nRisks Relating to Securities Markets and Investment in Our Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been subject to volatility, ranging from a low of $0.90 to a high of $3.15 in the 52-week period ending December 31, 2016. Our stock price has been affected by, among other things, the market's perception of our ability to finance our operations on an on-going basis, changes in the valuation of companies perceived by the market to be comparable to us, and changes in general economic, industry and market conditions. Stock markets have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the average daily trading volume of the securities of small companies, particularly small technology companies, can be very low. Limited trading volume of our stock may contribute to its volatility. Price declines in our common stock could result from general market and economic conditions and a variety of other factors, including any of the risk factors described in this report.\nThese broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. The market price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by\ninvestors who view our convertible notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect involving our common stock.\nThe sale or issuance by us of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.\nA substantial number of shares of our common stock may be issued in connection with the exercise of options outstanding under our equity incentive plans, the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, the exercise of outstanding warrants, the conversion of or exchange for outstanding 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes, and the conversion of our Series A preferred stock. See Note 2 in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the number of outstanding shares of potentially dilutive securities. Also see Note 10 in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the possible conversion of the 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes into shares of our common stock. In addition, we expect to issue additional shares under our equity incentive plans and employee stock purchase plan in the future. In the future, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity-linked securities to raise additional capital.\nAny future sale or issuance of common stock could adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.\nIf the market price of our common stock were to cease to be quoted on a national exchange, the market price of our common stock and our reputation would be negatively impacted.\nOur consolidated closing bid price has recently fallen below $1.00 per share and if it does not increase to $1.00 per share or more and we are unable to meet the stock price listing requirements of NASDAQ, including the requirement that our consolidated closing bid price not be below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, NASDAQ may issue a deficiency notice providing a 180 day compliance period prior to our common stock being subject to delisting from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. If our common stock were delisted from the NASDAQ Global Select Market, among other things, this could result in a number of negative implications, including reduced price and liquidity in our common stock as a result of the loss of market efficiencies associated with NASDAQ and the loss of federal preemption of state securities laws, as well as the potential loss of confidence by suppliers, customers and employees, the loss of institutional investor interest, the loss of the ability to raise future capital, less coverage by analysts, fewer business development opportunities and greater difficulty in obtaining financing. The threat of delisting may also lead to a \u201creverse split\u201d to increase the per share price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions of Delaware law (where we are incorporated), our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders;\n\u2022\nrequiring supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\ndividing our board of directors into three classes so that only one third of our directors will be up for election in any given year.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, under certain circumstances, may make it more difficult for a person who would be an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d as defined in Section 203, to effect various business combinations with us for a three-year period. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not exclude us from the restrictions imposed under Section 203. These provisions could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination\ninvolving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe incur significant expenses as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant additional legal, accounting and other expenses. For example, as a public company, we have adopted internal and disclosure controls and procedures and bear all of the internal and external costs of preparing and distributing periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under applicable securities laws.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations implemented by the SEC and the NASDAQ-GS, create uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. We evaluate and monitor developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and attract and retain qualified executive officers. If these requirements divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If securities or industry analysts do not continue coverage of our company, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause the price of our common stock and its trading volume to decline.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends, and accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur, would provide a return to stockholders. Our SVB Facility restricts our ability to pay cash dividends, and we may be subject to additional dividend restrictions under the terms of future indebtedness. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.", "PERMNO": 12797, "SIC": 2990, "TIC": "TVIAQ"}
