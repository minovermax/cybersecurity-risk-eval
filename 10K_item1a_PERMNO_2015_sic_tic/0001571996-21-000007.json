{"cik": "1571996", "company": "Dell Technologies Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nOur business, operating results, financial condition, and prospects are subject to a variety of significant risks, many of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of some of the important risk factors that may cause our actual results in future periods to differ substantially from those we currently expect or seek. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. There are additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that also may materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, or prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Our Industry\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may harm our business and result in reduced net revenue and profitability.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and associated containment measures have caused economic and financial disruptions globally, affecting regions in which we sell our products and services and in which we conduct our business operations. We are unable to predict the full impact the pandemic may have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the progression of the pandemic, governmental and other responses, vaccine availability, and the timing of economic recovery. We are also unable to predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our customers, suppliers, and other partners, which could materially adversely affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations and financial condition.\nDuring Fiscal 2021, COVID-19 disruptions contributed to a weakening of the demand environment for our ISG products and services, which reduced ISG net revenue from the prior year. Our business was adversely affected by supply constraints resulting from the pandemic that affected the timing of shipments of certain products in desired quantities or configurations. We also experienced increased freight rates as a result of limits on air freight capacity.\nMeasures taken to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, such as travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place, and shutdowns, have affected and will continue to affect our workforce and operations, and those of our vendors, suppliers, and partners. Restrictions on our operations or workforce, or similar limitations for others, may affect our ability to meet customer demand.\nWe have taken and will continue to take risk mitigation actions that we believe are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers, and other partners. Work-from-home and other measures introduce additional operational risks, including heightened cybersecurity risks. These measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and illness and workforce disruptions could lead to unavailability of key personnel and impair our ability to perform critical functions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue to cause disruption and volatility in the global debt and capital markets, which may increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our access to capital.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, and financial condition, it also may have the effect of exacerbating the other risks discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic have been unpredictable, and additional impacts and risks may arise that we are not aware of or are not able to respond to in an effective manner.\nCompetitive pressures may adversely affect our industry unit share position, revenue, and profitability.\nWe operate in an industry in which there are rapid technological advances in hardware, software, and services offerings. As a result, we face aggressive product and price competition from both branded and generic competitors. We compete based on our ability to offer to our customers integrated solutions that provide desired product and services features at a competitive price. Our competitors may provide products that are less costly, perform better or include additional features. Further, our product portfolios may quickly become outdated or our market share may quickly erode. Efforts to balance the mix of products and services to optimize profitability, liquidity, and growth may put pressure on our industry position.\nAs the technology industry continues to expand, there may be new and increased competition in different geographic regions. The generally low barriers into the technology industry increase the potential for challenges from new competitors. Competition also may intensify from an increase in options for mobile and cloud computing solutions. In addition, companies with which we have strategic alliances may become competitors in other product areas, or current competitors may enter into new strategic relationships with new or existing competitors, all of which may further increase competitive pressures.\nReliance on vendors for products and components, many of which are single-source or limited-source suppliers, could harm our business by adversely affecting product availability, delivery, reliability, and cost.\nWe maintain several single-source or limited-source supplier relationships, including relationships with third-party software providers, either because multiple sources are not readily available or because the relationships are advantageous due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price considerations. A delay in the supply of a critical single- or limited-source product or component may prevent the timely shipment of the related product in desired quantities or configurations. In addition, we may not be able to replace the functionality provided by third-party software currently offered with our products if that software becomes obsolete, defective, or incompatible with future product versions or is not adequately maintained or updated. Even where multiple sources of supply are available, qualification of the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of sales, which could harm our operating results.\nWe obtain many products and all of our components from third-party vendors, many of which are located outside of the United States. In addition, significant portions of our products are assembled by contract manufacturers, primarily in various locations in Asia. A significant concentration of such outsourced manufacturing is performed by only a few contract manufacturers, often in single locations. We sell components to these contract manufacturers and generate large non-trade accounts receivables, an arrangement that would present a risk of uncollectibility if the financial condition of a contract manufacturer should deteriorate.\nAlthough these relationships generate cost efficiencies, they limit our direct control over production. The increasing reliance on vendors subjects us to a greater risk of shortages and reduced control over delivery schedules of components and products, as well as a greater risk of increases in product and component costs. We may experience supply shortages and price increases caused by changes to raw material availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, public health issues, tariffs, trade disputes and protectionist measures, natural catastrophes or the effects of climate change (such as extreme weather conditions, sea level rise, drought, flooding and wildfires), and significant changes in the financial condition of our suppliers. Because we maintain minimal levels of component and product inventories, a disruption in component or product availability could harm our ability to satisfy customer needs. In addition, defective parts and products from these vendors could reduce product reliability and harm our reputation.\nIf we fail to achieve favorable pricing from vendors, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur profitability is affected by our ability to achieve favorable pricing from vendors and contract manufacturers, including through negotiations for vendor rebates, marketing funds, and other vendor funding received in the normal course of business. Because these supplier negotiations are continual and reflect the evolving competitive environment, the variability in timing and amount of incremental vendor discounts and rebates can affect our profitability. The vendor programs may change periodically, potentially resulting in adverse profitability trends if we cannot adjust pricing or variable costs. An inability to establish a cost and product advantage, or determine alternative means to deliver value to customers, may adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nAdverse global economic conditions may harm our business and result in reduced net revenue and profitability.\nAs a global company with customers operating in a broad range of businesses and industries, our performance is affected by global economic conditions and the demand for technology products and services in international markets. Adverse economic conditions may negatively affect customer demand, and could result in postponed or decreased spending amid customer concerns over unemployment, reduced asset values, volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses, local and state governments, and sovereign nations. Weak or unstable global economic conditions, including due to international trade protection measures and disputes, such as those between the United States and China, or due to public health issues, such as the outbreak of COVID-19 discussed above, also could harm our business by contributing to product shortages or delays, supply chain disruptions, insolvency of key suppliers, customer and counterparty insolvencies, increased product costs and associated price increases, reduced global sales, and other adverse effects on our operations. Any such effects could have a negative impact on our net revenue and profitability.\nThe results of operations of our business units may be adversely affected if we fail to successfully execute our strategy.\nOur strategy involves enabling the digital transformation of our customers while leading in the core infrastructure markets in which we compete. Accordingly, we must continue to expand our customer base through direct sales, new distribution channels, further development of relationships with resellers, and augmentation of selected business areas through targeted acquisitions and other commercial arrangements. As we reach more customers through new distribution channels and expanded reseller relationships, we may fail to manage effectively the increasingly difficult tasks of inventory management and demand forecasting. Our ability to implement this strategy depends on efficiently transitioning sales capabilities, successfully adding to the breadth of our solutions capabilities through selective acquisitions of other businesses, and effective management of the consequences of these strategic initiatives. If we are unable to meet these challenges, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are organized into three business units consisting of ISG, CSG, and VMware which are each important components of our strategy. ISG consists of a portfolio of storage, server, and networking solutions and faces intense competition from existing on-premises competitors and increasing competitive pressures from public cloud providers. Accordingly, we could be required to make additional investments to combat such competitive pressures and drive future growth. Such pressures could result in the erosion of revenue and operating income and adversely affect ISG\u2019s results of operations. To address an industry trend toward hybrid-computing models, we have developed and continue to develop traditional, converged, and hyper-converged infrastructure solutions. ISG\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected if such solutions are not adopted by our customers or potential customers, or if customers move rapidly to adopt public cloud solutions.\nCSG largely relies on sales of desktops, workstations, and notebooks. Revenue from CSG absorbs our overhead costs and allows for scaled procurement. CSG faces risk and uncertainties from fundamental changes in the personal computer (\u201cPC\u201d) market, including a decline in worldwide revenues for desktops, workstations, and notebooks, and lower shipment forecasts for these products due to a general lengthening of the replacement cycle. Any reduced demand for PC products or a significant increase in competition could cause operating income to fluctuate and adversely impact CSG\u2019s results of operations.\nThe success of the VMware business unit depends increasingly on customer acceptance of VMware\u2019s newer products and services. VMware\u2019s solutions are primarily based on server virtualization and related compute technologies used for virtualizing on-premises data center servers, which form the foundation for private cloud computing. As the market for server virtualization continues to mature, the rate of growth in license sales of products such as VMware\u2019s vSphere has declined. The VMware business unit has been increasingly directing its product development and marketing efforts toward products and services that enable businesses to utilize virtualization as the foundation for private, public, hybrid and multi-cloud-based computing, and mobile computing. To the extent that VMware\u2019s newer offerings are adopted by customers more slowly than the rate of decrease in revenue growth in the established server virtualization offerings, this segment\u2019s revenue growth rates may slow materially or its revenue may decline, and VMware may fail to realize returns on its investments in new initiatives.\nIf our cost efficiency measures are not successful, we may become less competitive.\nWe continue to focus on minimizing operating expenses through cost improvements and simplification of our corporate structure. We may experience delays or unanticipated costs in implementing our cost efficiency plans, which could prevent the timely or full achievement of expected cost efficiencies and adversely affect our competitive position.\nOur inability to manage solutions and product and services transitions in an effective manner could reduce the demand for our solutions, products, and services, and negatively affect the profitability of our operations.\nContinuing improvements in technology result in the frequent introduction of new solutions, products, and services, improvements in product performance characteristics, and short product life cycles. If we fail to manage effectively transitions to new solutions and offerings, the products and services associated with such offerings and customer demand for our solutions, products, and services could diminish, and our profitability could suffer.\nWe increasingly source new products and transition existing products through our contract manufacturers and manufacturing outsourcing relationships to generate cost efficiencies and better serve our customers. The success of product transitions depends on a number of factors, including the availability of sufficient quantities of components at attractive costs. Product\ntransitions also present execution uncertainties and risks, including the risk that new or upgraded products may have quality problems or other defects.\nFailure to deliver high-quality products, software, and services could lead to loss of customers and diminished profitability.\nWe must identify and address quality issues associated with its products, software, and services, many of which include third-party components. Although quality testing is performed regularly to detect quality problems and implement required solutions, failure to identify and correct significant product quality issues before the sale of such products to customers could result in lower sales, increased warranty or replacement expenses, and reduced customer confidence, which could harm our operating results.\nCyber attacks or other security incidents that disrupt our operations or result in the breach or other compromise of proprietary or confidential information about us or our workforce, customers, or other third parties could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, cause us to lose clients and expose us to costly regulatory enforcement and litigation.\nWe routinely manage, store, transmit and otherwise process large amounts of proprietary information and confidential data, including sensitive and personally identifiable information, relating to our operations and our customers. We face numerous and evolving cyber risks of increasing scale and volume.\nDespite our internal controls and significant investment in security measures, criminal or other unauthorized threat actors, including nation states or state-sponsored organizations, may be able to penetrate our security measures, breach our information technology systems, misappropriate or compromise confidential and proprietary information of our company and our customers, cause system disruptions and shutdowns, or introduce ransomware, malware, or vulnerabilities into our products, systems, and networks or those of our customers and partners. Employees, contractors, or other insiders may introduce vulnerabilities into our environments or otherwise may seek to misappropriate our intellectual property and proprietary information. Hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that unexpectedly could interfere with the operation of our products. The shift to work-from-home arrangements resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may also increase our vulnerability, as employees and contractors of our company and third-party providers are working remotely and using home networks that may pose a significant risk to network security. In the past, we have experienced security incidents, including the unauthorized activity on our network attempting to extract Dell.com customer information we disclosed in November 2018.\nThe costs to address cyber risks, both before and after a security incident, could be significant, regardless of whether incidents result from an attack on us directly or on third-party vendors upon which we rely. Cyberattacks could compromise our internal systems and products and the systems of our customers, resulting in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service that could disrupt business operations for us and our customers. Our remediation efforts may not be successful or timely. Any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or those of third parties we sell, could lead to loss of existing or potential customers, and may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution, outsourcing services, information technology solutions, and other critical functions and offerings. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our customers, or other third parties could impair our intellectual property rights and expose us, our customers, or such other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of such information or data. Any such incidents could also subject us to government investigations and regulatory enforcement actions, litigation, potential liability, damage our brand and reputation, or otherwise harm our business and operations.\nAs a global enterprise, we are subject to laws and regulations in the United States and other countries relating to the collection, use, and protection of customer and other data. Our ability to execute transactions and to process and use personal information and data in the conduct of our business subjects us to compliance with applicable laws and regulations and may require us to notify regulators, customers, employees, or other individuals or entities of a security incident or data or privacy breach. We continue to incur significant expenditures to comply with mandatory privacy and security requirements and controls imposed by law, regulation, industry standards, and contractual obligations. Despite such expenditures, we may face regulatory and other legal actions, including potential liability, in the event of a security incident or data or privacy breach or perceived or actual non-compliance with such requirements and controls.\nWe may not successfully implement our acquisition strategy, which could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and increased costs.\nWe make strategic acquisitions of other companies as part of our growth strategy. We could experience unforeseen operating difficulties in integrating the businesses, technologies, services, products, personnel, or operations of acquired companies, especially if we are unable to retain the key personnel of an acquired company. Further, future acquisitions may result in a delay or reduction of sales for both us and the acquired company because of customer uncertainty about the continuity and effectiveness of solutions offered by either company and may disrupt our existing business by diverting resources and significant management attention that otherwise would be focused on development of the existing business. Acquisitions also may negatively affect our relationships with strategic partners if the acquisitions are seen as bringing us into competition with such partners.\nTo complete an acquisition, we may be required to use substantial amounts of cash, engage in equity or debt financings, or enter into credit agreements to secure additional funds. Such debt financings could involve restrictive covenants that might limit our capital-raising activities and operating flexibility. Further, an acquisition may negatively affect our results of operations because it may expose us to unexpected liabilities, require the incurrence of charges and substantial indebtedness or other liabilities, have adverse tax consequences, result in acquired in-process research and development expenses, or in the future require the amortization, write-down, or impairment of amounts related to deferred compensation, goodwill, and other intangible assets, or fail to generate a financial return sufficient to offset acquisition costs.\nIn addition, we periodically divest businesses, including businesses that are no longer a part of our strategic plan. These divestitures similarly require significant investment of time and resources, may disrupt our business and distract management from other responsibilities, and may result in losses on disposition or continued financial involvement in the divested business, including through indemnification or other financial arrangements, for a period following the transaction, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur ability to generate substantial non-U.S. net revenue is subject to additional risks and uncertainties.\nSales outside the United States accounted for approximately half of our consolidated net revenue for Fiscal 2021. Our future growth rates and success are substantially dependent on the continued growth of our business outside of the United States. Our international operations face many risks and uncertainties, including varied local economic and labor conditions; political instability; public health issues; changes in the U.S. and international regulatory environments; the impacts of trade protection measures, including increases in tariffs and trade barriers due to the current geopolitical climate and changes and instability in government policies and international trade arrangements, which could adversely affect our ability to conduct business in non-U.S. markets; tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign operations); potential theft or other compromise of our technology, data, or intellectual property; copyright levies; and foreign currency exchange rates. Our international operations could suffer as a result of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit, including as a result of modification of trade, immigration, and commercial regulation. We could incur additional operating costs, or sustain supply chain disruptions, due to any such changes. Any of these factors could negatively affect our international business results and growth prospects.\nOur profitability may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of products and services, customers, or geographic sales, and by seasonal sales trends.\nOur overall profitability for any period may be adversely affected by changes in the mix of products and services, customers, or geographic markets reflected in sales for that period, and by seasonal trends. Profit margins vary among products, services, customers, and geographic markets. For example, services offerings generally have a higher profit margin than consumer products. In addition, parts of our business are subject to seasonal sales trends. Among the trends with the most significant impact on our operating results, sales to government customers (particularly the U.S. federal government) generally are stronger in our third fiscal quarter, sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa are often weaker in our third fiscal quarter, and sales to consumers are typically strongest during our fourth fiscal quarter.\nWe may lose revenue opportunities and experience gross margin pressure if sales channel participants fail to perform as expected.\nWe rely on value-added resellers, system integrators, distributors, and retailers as sales channels to complement our direct sales organization in order to reach more end-users. Future operating results depend on the performance of sales channel participants and on our success in maintaining and developing these relationships. Revenue and gross margins could be negatively affected if the financial condition or operations of channel participants weaken as a result of adverse economic conditions or other business challenges, or if uncertainty regarding the demand for our products causes channel participants to reduce their orders for these products. Further, some channel participants may consider the expansion of our direct sales initiatives to conflict with their business interests as distributors or resellers of our products, which could lead them to reduce their investment in the distribution and sale of such products, or to cease all sales of our products.\nOur financial performance could suffer from reduced access to the capital markets by us or some of our customers.\nWe may access debt and capital sources to provide financing for customers and to obtain funds for general corporate purposes, including working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and funding of customer receivables. In addition, we maintain customer financing relationships with some companies that rely on access to the debt and capital markets to meet significant funding needs. Any inability of these companies to access such markets could compel us to self-fund transactions with such companies or to forgo customer financing opportunities, which could harm our financial performance. The debt and capital markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption from time to time in the future, which could result in higher credit spreads in such markets and higher funding costs for us. Deterioration in our business performance, a credit rating downgrade, volatility in the securitization markets, changes in financial services regulation, or adverse changes in the economy could lead to reductions in the availability of debt financing. In addition, these events could limit our ability to continue asset securitizations or other forms of financing from debt or capital sources, reduce the amount of financing receivables that we originate, or negatively affect the costs or terms on which we may be able to obtain capital. Any of these developments could adversely affect our net revenue, profitability, and cash flows.\nIf the value of goodwill or intangible assets is materially impaired, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nAs of January 29, 2021, goodwill and intangible assets, net had a combined carrying value of $55.3 billion, representing approximately 45% of our total consolidated assets. We periodically evaluate goodwill and intangible assets, net to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired, in which case an impairment charge may be necessary. The value of goodwill may be materially and adversely affected if businesses that we acquire perform in a manner that is inconsistent with our assumptions at the time of acquisition. In addition, from time to time we divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and intangible assets, net. Any future evaluations resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, net could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in the period in which the impairment is recognized.\nWeak economic conditions and additional regulation could harm our financial services activities.\nOur financial services activities are negatively affected by adverse economic conditions that contribute to loan delinquencies and defaults. An increase in loan delinquencies and defaults would result in greater net credit losses, which may require us to increase our reserves for customer receivables.\nIn addition, the implementation of new financial services regulations, or the application of existing financial services regulation, in countries where we conduct our financial services and related supporting activities, could unfavorably affect the profitability and cash flows of our consumer financing activities.\nWe are subject to counterparty default risks.\nWe have numerous arrangements with financial institutions that include cash and investment deposits, interest rate swap contracts, foreign currency option contracts, and forward contracts. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the counterparty to one or more of these arrangements will default, either voluntarily or involuntarily, on its performance under the terms of the arrangement. In times of market distress, a counterparty may default rapidly and without notice, and we may be unable to take\naction to cover its exposure, either because of lack of contractual ability to do so or because market conditions make it difficult to take effective action. If one of our counterparties becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, our ability eventually to recover any losses suffered as a result of that counterparty\u2019s default may be limited by the impaired liquidity of the counterparty or the applicable legal regime governing the bankruptcy proceeding. In the event of such a default, we could incur significant losses, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur performance and business could suffer if our contracts for ISG services and solutions fail to produce revenue at expected levels due to exercise of customer rights under the contracts, inaccurate estimation of costs, or customer defaults in payment.\nWe offer our ISG customers a range of consumption models for our services and solutions, including as-a-service, utility, leases, or immediate pay models, all designed to match customers\u2019 consumption preferences. These solutions generally are multiyear agreements that typically result in recurring revenue streams over the term of the arrangement. Our financial results and growth depend, in part, on customers continuing to purchase our services and solutions over the contract life on the agreed terms. The contracts allow customers to take actions that may adversely affect our recurring revenue and profitability. These actions include terminating a contract if our performance does not meet specified services levels, requesting rate reductions, reducing the use of our services and solutions or terminating a contract early upon payment of agreed fees. In addition, we estimate the costs of delivering the services and solutions at the outset of the contract. If we fail to estimate such costs accurately and actual costs significantly exceed estimates, we may incur losses on the contracts. We also are subject to the risk of loss under the contracts as a result of a default, voluntarily or involuntarily, in payment by the customer, whether because of financial weakness or other reasons.\nLoss of government contracts could harm our business.\nContracts with U.S. federal, state, and local governments and with foreign governments are subject to future funding that may affect the extension or termination of programs and to the right of such governments to terminate contracts for convenience or non-appropriation. There is pressure on governments, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending. Funding reductions or delays could adversely affect public sector demand for our products and services. In addition, if we violate legal or regulatory requirements, the applicable government could suspend or disbar us as a contractor, which would unfavorably affect our net revenue and profitability.\nOur business could suffer if we do not develop and protect our proprietary intellectual property or obtain or protect licenses to intellectual property developed by others on commercially reasonable and competitive terms.\nIf we or our suppliers are unable to develop or protect desirable technology or technology licenses, we may be prevented from marketing products, may have to market products without desirable features, or may incur substantial costs to redesign products. We also may have to defend or enforce legal actions or pay damages if we are found to have violated the intellectual property of other parties. Although our suppliers might be contractually obligated to obtain or protect such licenses and indemnify us against related expenses, those suppliers could be unable to meet their obligations. We invest in research and development and obtain additional intellectual property through acquisitions, but those activities do not guarantee that we will develop or obtain intellectual property necessary for profitable operations. Costs involved in developing and protecting rights in intellectual property may have a negative impact on our business. In addition, our operating costs could increase because of copyright levies or similar fees by rights holders and collection agencies in European and other countries.\nInfrastructure disruptions could harm our business.\nWe depend on our information technology and manufacturing infrastructure to achieve our business objectives. Natural disasters, manufacturing failures, telecommunications system failures, or defective or improperly installed new or upgraded business management systems could lead to disruptions in this infrastructure. Portions of our IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays, or cessations of service, or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work. Such disruptions may adversely affect our ability to receive or process orders, manufacture and ship products in a timely manner, or otherwise conduct business in the normal course. Further, portions of our services business involve the processing, storage, and transmission of data, which also would be negatively affected by such an event. Disruptions in our infrastructure could lead to loss of customers and revenue, particularly during a period of heavy demand for our products and services. We also could incur significant expense in repairing system damage and taking other remedial measures.\nFailure to hedge effectively our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe utilize derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Some of these instruments and contracts may involve elements of market and credit risk in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements. Global economic events, including trade disputes, economic sanctions and emerging market volatility, and associated uncertainty may cause currencies to fluctuate, which may contribute to variations in our sales of products and services in various jurisdictions. If we are not successful in monitoring our foreign exchange exposures and conducting an effective hedging program, our foreign currency hedging activities may not offset the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates on our future results of operations and financial position.\nAdverse legislative or regulatory tax changes, the expiration of tax holidays or favorable tax rate structures, or unfavorable outcomes in tax audits and other tax compliance matters could result in an increase in our tax expense or our effective income tax rate.\nChanges in tax laws (including any future U.S. Treasury notices or regulations related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017) could adversely affect our operations and profitability. In recent years, numerous legislative, judicial, and administrative changes have been made to tax laws applicable to us and similar companies. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the \u201cOECD\u201d), an international association of 37 countries, including the United States, has issued guidelines that change long-standing tax principles. The OECD guidelines may introduce tax uncertainty as countries amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the guidelines. Additional changes to tax laws are likely to occur, and such changes may adversely affect our tax liability.\nPortions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays that expire in whole or in part from time to time. Many of these holidays may be extended when certain conditions are met, or may be terminated if certain conditions are not met. If the tax holidays are not extended, or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate, our effective tax rate would be affected. Our effective tax rate also could be impacted if our geographic sales mix changes. In addition, any actions by us to repatriate non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for U.S. taxes may affect the effective tax rate.\nWe are continually under audit in various tax jurisdictions. We may not be successful in resolving potential tax claims that arise from these audits. An unfavorable outcome in certain of these matters could result in a substantial increase in our tax expense. In addition, our provision for income taxes could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets.\nOur profitability could suffer from any impairment of our portfolio investments.\nWe invest a significant portion of available funds in a portfolio consisting primarily of debt securities of various types and maturities pending the deployment of these funds in our business. Our earnings performance could suffer from any impairment of our investments. Our portfolio securities generally are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded in our financial statements at fair value. If any such investments experience declines in market price and it is determined that such declines are other than temporary, we may have to recognize in earnings the decline in the fair market value of such investments below their cost or carrying value.\nUnfavorable results of legal proceedings could harm our business and result in substantial costs.\nWe are involved in various claims, suits, investigations, and legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business, as well as those that arose in connection with the Class V transaction, including those described elsewhere in this report. Additional legal claims or regulatory matters affecting us and our subsidiaries may arise in the future and could involve stockholder, consumer, regulatory, compliance, intellectual property, antitrust, tax, and other issues on a global basis. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. Regardless of the merits of a claim, litigation may be both time-consuming and disruptive to our business. We could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could adversely affect our operating results or cash flows in a particular period. In addition, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or\nif we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions.\nCompliance requirements of current or future environmental and safety laws, or other laws, may increase costs, expose us to potential liability and otherwise harm our business.\nOur operations are subject to environmental and safety regulations in all areas in which we conduct business. Product design and procurement operations must comply with new and future requirements relating to climate change laws and regulations, materials composition, sourcing, energy efficiency and collection, recycling, treatment, transportation, and disposal of electronics products, including restrictions on mercury, lead, cadmium, lithium metal, lithium ion, and other substances. If we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations regarding the transportation, source, use, and sale of such regulated substances, we could be subject to liability. The costs and timing of costs under environmental and safety laws are difficult to predict, but could have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn addition, we and our subsidiaries are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and are also subject to export controls, customs, economic sanctions laws, and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other anti-corruption laws or export control, customs, or economic sanctions laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, and we and our subsidiaries may be subject to other liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act intended to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. We incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements of this law and other costs relating to the sourcing and availability of minerals used in our products. Further, we may face reputational harm if our customers or other stakeholders conclude that we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the minerals used in our products.\nArmed hostilities, terrorism, natural disasters, climate change, or public health issues could harm our business.\nArmed hostilities, terrorism, natural disasters, climate change or public health issues, whether in the United States or in other countries, could cause damage or disruption to us or our suppliers and customers, or could create political or economic instability, any of which could harm our business. For example, tornadoes in Tennessee, wildfires in California, and typhoons in the Phillipines disrupted our operations in those areas in recent periods. Any such events in the future could cause a decrease in demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible to deliver products or for suppliers to deliver components, and create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain.\nThe long-term effects of climate change on the technology industry and the global economy are unclear. Climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intensity. Such events could affect our ability to provide services and solutions to our customers and could result in reductions in sales, earnings, or productivity resulting from such potential impacts as production delays or limitations, adverse effects on distributors, supply chain disruptions, and reduced access to facilities.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Michael S. Dell, our Chief Executive Officer, and our success depends on the ability to attract, retain, and motivate key employees.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Michael S. Dell, our founder, Chief Executive Officer, and largest stockholder. If we lose the services of Mr. Dell, we may not be able to locate a suitable or qualified replacement, and we may incur additional expenses to recruit a replacement, which could severely disrupt our business and growth. Further, we rely on key personnel, including other members of our executive leadership team, to support our business and increasingly complex product and services offerings. We may not be able to attract, retain, and motivate the key professional, technical, marketing, and staff resources needed.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWhile we continue to prioritize debt paydown as part of our overall capital allocation strategy, our level of indebtedness requires significant interest and other debt service payments. As of January 29, 2021, we and our subsidiaries had approximately $48.5 billion aggregate principal amount of indebtedness. As of the same date, we and our subsidiaries also had an additional $5.5 billion available for borrowing under our revolving credit facilities.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022we must use a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our senior credit facilities, our senior secured and senior unsecured notes, and our other indebtedness, which reduces funds available to us for other purposes such as working capital, capital expenditures, other general corporate purposes, and potential acquisitions;\n\u2022our ability to refinance such indebtedness or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes may be impaired;\n\u2022we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates because our senior credit facilities have variable rates of interest;\n\u2022our level of indebtedness may be greater than that of some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in responding to current and changing industry and financial market conditions; and\n\u2022we may be unable to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants in our senior credit facilities, our senior notes, and other indebtedness that limit our ability to incur additional debt, make investments and sell assets, which could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects and could force it into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our and our subsidiaries\u2019 credit facilities and the indentures that govern the senior notes. If new indebtedness is added to the debt levels of us and our subsidiaries, the related risks that we now face could intensify. Our ability to access additional funding under existing revolving credit facilities will depend upon, among other factors, the absence of a default under any such facility, including any default arising from a failure to comply with the related covenants. If we are unable to comply with our covenants under our revolving credit facilities, our liquidity may be adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, when we believe it is advantageous to do so, we may seek to reduce leverage by repaying or retiring certain of our indebtedness before the maturity dates of such indebtedness. We may be unable to generate operating cash flows and other cash necessary to achieve a level of debt reduction that will significantly enhance our credit quality and reduce the risks associated with our indebtedness.\nAs of January 29, 2021, approximately $11.3 billion of our debt was variable-rate indebtedness and a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an increase of approximately $93 million in annual interest expense on such indebtedness. Our ability to meet our expenses, to remain in compliance with our covenants under our debt instruments and to make future principal and interest payments in respect of our indebtedness depends on, among other factors, our operating performance, competitive developments, and financial market conditions, all of which are significantly affected by financial, business, economic, and other factors. We are not able to control many of these factors.\nOur current outstanding variable-rate indebtedness uses the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. As result of these reforms, LIBOR is expected to be phased out starting on January 1, 2022 for the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR settings and starting on July 1, 2023 for the remaining USD LIBOR settings. Alternatives to LIBOR may perform differently than in the past. We are in the process of amending relevant agreements based on LIBOR, but we cannot predict what alternative index will be negotiated with our counterparties. As a result, our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. In addition, uncertainty as to the nature of a potential discontinuance, modification, alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely\naffect the trading market for securities linked to such benchmarks. We, however, cannot predict the timing of these developments or their impact on our indebtedness or financial condition.\nOur financial performance is affected by the financial performance of VMware, Inc.\nWe consolidate the financial results of VMware, Inc., a publicly traded subsidiary, in our results of operations. Certain adjustments and eliminations are required to reconcile VMware, Inc.\u2019s standalone financial results to the VMware reportable segment financial results consolidated in our results of operations. Such adjustments and eliminations primarily consist of intercompany sales and allocated expenses, as well as expenses that are excluded from the VMware reportable segment, such as amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, severance, and integration and acquisition-related costs. For the fiscal year ended January 29, 2021, VMware reportable segment net revenue accounted for 13% of Dell Technologies\u2019 total reportable segment net revenue, and VMware reportable segment operating income accounted for 33% of Dell Technologies\u2019 total reportable segment operating income. As a result, our financial performance is affected by the financial performance of VMware, Inc. and by the risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect VMware, Inc.\u2019s business, operating results, financial condition or prospects. See Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for a reconciliation of reportable segment results to consolidated results.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Class C Common Stock\nOur multi-class common stock structure with different voting rights may adversely affect the trading price of the Class C Common Stock.\nEach share of our Class A Common Stock and each share of our Class B Common Stock has ten votes, while each share of our Class C Common Stock has one vote. Because of these disparate voting rights, Michael Dell and the Susan Lieberman Dell Separate Property Trust (the \u201cMD stockholders\u201d) and certain investment funds affiliated with Silver Lake Partners (the \u201cSLP stockholders\u201d) collectively held common stock representing approximately 94.8% of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock as of January 29, 2021. The limited ability of holders of the Class C Common Stock to influence matters requiring stockholder approval may adversely affect the market price of the Class C Common Stock.\nIn addition, in 2017, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones changed their eligibility criteria to exclude new companies with multiple classes of shares of common stock from being added to certain stock indices. FTSE Russell instituted a requirement that new and, beginning in September 2022, existing constituents of its indices have greater than 5% of their voting rights in the hands of public stockholders, as calculated by FTSE Russell, whereas S&P Dow Jones announced that companies with multiple share classes, such as Dell Technologies, will not be eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Other major stock indices might adopt similar requirements in the future. FTSE Russell\u2019s determination may change at any time. Under the current criteria, at a minimum, our multi-class capital structure makes it ineligible for inclusion in the S&P Dow Jones indices, including those making up the S&P Composite 1500, and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that track these indices will not invest in the Class C Common Stock. It is unclear what effect, if any, exclusion from any indices will have on the valuations of the affected publicly-traded companies. It is possible that such policies may depress the valuations of public companies excluded from such indices compared to valuations of companies that are included.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, of a substantial amount of shares of the Class C Common Stock could depress the trading price of the Class C Common Stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of the Class C Common Stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of the Class C Common Stock, which could make it more difficult for investors to sell their shares of Class C Common Stock at a time and price that they consider appropriate. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also could impair our ability to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price we deem appropriate, and our ability to use Class C Common Stock as consideration for acquisitions of other businesses, investments, or other corporate purposes. As of January 29, 2021, we had a total of approximately 266 million shares of Class C Common Stock outstanding.\nAs of January 29, 2021, the 383,724,977 outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock held by the MD stockholders and the 101,685,217 outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock held by the SLP stockholders are convertible into shares of Class C\nCommon Stock at any time on a one-to-one basis. Although the MD stockholders and the SLP stockholders generally are subject to agreements that restrict their sale or other transfer of common stock until June 27, 2021, thereafter such shares, upon any conversion into shares of Class C Common Stock, will be eligible for resale in the public market pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), subject to volume, manner of sale, and other limitations under Rule 144.\nIn addition, as of January 29, 2021, we entered into a registration rights agreement with holders of 383,724,977 outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock (which are convertible into shares of Class C Common Stock), holders of all of the 101,685,217 outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock (which are convertible into shares of Class C Common Stock), and holders of 17,531,449 outstanding shares of Class C Common Stock, pursuant to which we granted such holders and their permitted transferees shelf, demand and/or piggyback registration rights with respect to such shares. Registration of those shares under the Securities Act would permit such holders to sell the shares into the public market.\nFurther, as of January 29, 2021, we had 38,176,604 shares of Class C Common Stock that may be issued upon the exercise, vesting, or settlement of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, or deferred stock units under our stock incentive plans, all of which would have been, upon issuance, eligible for sale in the public market, subject where applicable to expiration or waiver of contractual transfer restrictions, and an additional 31,650,562 shares of Class C Common Stock that have been authorized and reserved for issuance pursuant to potential future awards under the stock incentive plans. We also may issue additional stock options in the future that may be exercised for additional shares of Class C Common Stock and additional restricted stock units or deferred stock units that may vest. We expect that all shares of Class C Common Stock issuable with respect to such awards will be registered under one or more registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act and available for sale in the open market.\nWe do not presently intend to pay cash dividends on the Class C Common Stock.\nWe do not presently intend to pay cash dividends on the Class C Common Stock. Accordingly, investors may have to rely on sales of the Class C Common Stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any gains on their investment in the Class C Common Stock.\nWe are controlled by the MD stockholders, who, together with the SLP stockholders, collectively own a substantial majority of our common stock and are able to effectively control our actions, including approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions.\nBy reason of their ownership of Class A Common Stock possessing a majority of the aggregate votes entitled to be cast by holders of all outstanding shares of our common stock voting together as a single class, the MD stockholders have the ability to approve any matter submitted to the vote of all of the outstanding shares of the common stock voting together as a single class.\nThrough their control, the MD stockholders are able to control our actions, including actions related to the election of our directors and directors of our subsidiaries (including VMware, Inc. and its subsidiaries), amendments to our organizational documents, and the approval of significant corporate transactions, including mergers and sales of substantially all of our assets that our stockholders may deem advantageous. For example, although our bylaws provide that the number of directors will be fixed by resolution of the board of directors, our stockholders may adopt, amend, or repeal the bylaws in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law. Through their control, the MD stockholders therefore may amend our bylaws to change the number of directors (within the limits of the certificate of incorporation), notwithstanding any determination by the board of directors regarding board size.\nFurther, as of January 29, 2021, the MD stockholders and the SLP stockholders collectively beneficially owned 65.2% of our outstanding common stock. This concentration of ownership together with the disparate voting rights of our common stock may delay or deter possible changes in control of Dell Technologies, which may reduce the value of an investment in the Class C Common Stock. So long as the MD stockholders and the SLP stockholders continue to own common stock representing a significant amount of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock, even if such amount is, individually or in the aggregate, less than 50%, such stockholders will continue to be able to strongly influence our decisions.\nIn addition, the MD stockholders and the SLP stockholders, respectively, have the right to nominate a number of individuals for election as Group I Directors which is equal to the percentage of the total voting power for the regular election of directors beneficially owned by the MD stockholders or by the SLP stockholders multiplied by the number of directors then on the board of directors who are not members of the audit committee, rounded up to the nearest whole number. Further, so long as the MD\nstockholders or the SLP stockholders each beneficially own at least 5% of all outstanding shares of the common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, each of the MD stockholders or the SLP stockholders, as applicable, are entitled to nominate at least one individual for election as a Group I Director.\nThe MD stockholders, the MSD Partners stockholders, and the SLP stockholders and their respective affiliates may have interests that conflict with the interests of other stockholders or those of Dell Technologies.\nIn the ordinary course of their business activities, the MD stockholders, certain investment funds affiliated with an investment firm formed by principals of the firm that manages the capital of Michael Dell and his family (the \u201cMSD Partners stockholders\u201d), and the SLP stockholders and their respective affiliates may engage in activities in which their interests conflict with our interests or those of other stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation provides that none of the MD stockholders, the MSD Partners stockholders, the SLP stockholders, nor any of their respective affiliates or any director or officer of the Company who is also a director, officer, employee, managing director, or other affiliate (other than Michael Dell) have any duty to refrain from engaging, directly or indirectly, in the same business activities or similar business activities or lines of business in which we operate. The MD stockholders, the MSD Partners stockholders, and the SLP stockholders also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, such stockholders may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance the value of their investment in Dell Technologies, even though such transactions might involve risks to other stockholders.\nBecause we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NYSE rules and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements, holders of Class C Common Stock do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NYSE rules because the MD stockholders hold common stock representing more than 50% of the voting power in the election of directors. As a controlled company, we may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements under NYSE rules, including the requirements that we have a board composed of a majority of \u201cindependent directors,\u201d as defined under NYSE rules, and that we have a compensation committee and a nominating/corporate governance committee each composed entirely of independent directors. Although we currently maintain a board composed of a majority of independent directors, we currently utilize the exemptions relating to committee composition and expect to continue to utilize those exemptions. As a result, none of the committees of the board of directors, other than the audit committee, consists entirely of independent directors. Further, we may decide in the future to change our board membership so that the board is not composed of a majority of independent directors. Accordingly, holders of Class C Common Stock do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE\u2019s corporate governance requirements.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates a state court of the State of Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit the ability of the holders of Class C Common Stock to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or with our directors, officers, or controlling stockholders.\nUnder our certificate of incorporation, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum will be, to the fullest extent permitted by law, a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) for:\n\u2022any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or stockholder of Dell Technologies to us or our stockholders;\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against Dell Technologies or any director or officer or stockholder of Dell Technologies arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or\n\u2022any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or stockholder of Dell Technologies governed by our internal affairs doctrine.\nThese provisions of our certificate of incorporation could limit the ability of the holders of the Class C Common Stock to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or with our directors, officers, or controlling stockholders, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our organizational documents inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe choice of forum provision is intended to apply to the fullest extent permitted by law to the above-specified types of actions and proceedings, including, to the extent permitted by the federal securities laws, to lawsuits asserting both the above-specified claims and claims under the federal securities laws. Application of the choice of forum provision may be limited in some instances by applicable law. Section 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the choice of forum provision will not apply to actions arising under the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, subject to a limited exception for certain \u201ccovered class actions.\u201d There is uncertainty, particularly in light of current litigation, as to whether a court would enforce the choice of forum provision with respect to claims under the Securities Act. Our stockholders will not be deemed, by operation of the choice of forum provision, to have waived claims arising under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.", "PERMNO": 18267, "SIC": 3571, "TIC": "DELL"}
